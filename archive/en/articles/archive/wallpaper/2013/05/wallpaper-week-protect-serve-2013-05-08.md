Welcome to Wallpaper of the Week! It's Fuse Week and we have something special for you! The Facebook header combines both sides of [Ryan Barger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Ryan+Barger%22%5D)'s [Protect & Serve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protect+%26+Serve).


We also have a set of wallpapers for each side of the card! Use one, the other, or both! No mana required! If you have two monitors you can enjoy a truly fused experience by putting one on each monitor!


Here's [Protect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protect).
