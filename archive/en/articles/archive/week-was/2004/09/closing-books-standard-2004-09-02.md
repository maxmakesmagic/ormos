Closing the Books on Standard

 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






[Grand Prix Nagoya](/en/events/coverage/goblins-take-title-nagoya) marked the last significant Standard event before the 2004 World Championships. After this weekend Standard will become the domain of Friday Night **Magic** until the introduction of [Champions of Kamigawa](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/displayexpansion.asp?set=chk&page=1) and the much-anticipated State Championships.

Grand Prix Nagoya's Pro Tour Invitations fed into Pro Tour Columbus but unlike every other PTQ held around the World it was run using the Standard format--the same format as Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur. Last year at the similarly Standard Grand Prix Bangkok, Tsuyoshi Fujita dropped a goblin bomb on the format with his Goblin Bidding deck. 

There were no significant surprises in the Top 8 although Masami Ibamoto's Deathcloud deck arched a few eyebrows. Although four Affinity decks made the Top 8 it was green-red Goblins that earned Tatsunori Yishi a $2,400 payday and an invite to Pro Tour Columbus. The finals mirrored the finals of Japanese Nationals when Tsuyoshi Fujita first called attention to the deck and won his National Championship.

The real surprise came in the final standings. Tsuyoshi Fujita, Osamu Fujita, and Itaru Ishida seemingly make the cut to the Top 8 of Asian Grand Prix at will but this time they all finished well outside the money. This seemed especially crushing since they were all playing the decks that they expected to bring to the Standard portion of Worlds. 

Pro Tour winner Mashashiro Kuroda battled with illness--likely brought on by the stress of a newborn baby not ten days old--and although he rode a roller coaster on day two from the top of the standings down to the middle of the pack and then back up to tenth with wins in the closing rounds. Although he finished strong he felt too terrible after the weekend to justify the trip to Worlds and elected to stay home with his new baby girl.

Coming into Worlds the deck that seemed to attract the most attention from the rest of the world was Tomohauru Saitou's blue-white control deck that was sporting main deck [Relic Barrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+Barrier)s. A number of players including Brian Kibler, Jon Finkel, and Seth Burn were playing decks based off of Saitous's build at World's this week--sans the [Decree of Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Silence).

| *Itaru Ishida* |

A deck that was notably absent from the Top 8 was the mono-green Tooth and Nail deck the Japanese **Magic** community refers to as Tron. There were a dozen such decks on Day Two--fifteen Tooth decks made Day Two overall--and not a one reached the elimination rounds. With their confidence in the Tron deck deeply shaken, players such as Itaru Ishida were forced to look to Goblins as the plan for Worlds instead.

Masami Ibamoto followed his Sunday appearance as a member of S.A.I. from Seattle with another Top 4 this past weekend. He cobbled together a last minute Death Cloud deck when he had to build decks for his friend and his girlfriend for the tournament. He gave his best deck--goblins--to his friend Hirotaka Hata. Hata finished in twenty-first place and won $250. He gave his Mycosynth Golem combo deck to his girlfriend--no word on where she finished.

Ibamoto stayed with the hot hand for Worlds and played another Death Cloud deck. He felt that he could have won the event with a little time to think about his deck. He would have included both [Relic Barrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+Barrier)s and Infests in his sideboard. After having the time to think for Worlds he abandoned blue and switched to red for [Siege-Gang Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander)!!!

### On the Other Hand…

While there was nothing startling in the main event there was something of a stir in the Junior open when thirteen year old Ryosuke Yagi managed to defeat a field of close to fifty players with his Krark-Clan Ironworks deck. It was Ryusuke's first actual sanctioned tournament and he picked up the deck cold when he borrowed it from an older friend.

### The Week that Is…

*Go watch!* |

Things are a little light for today's column--apologies. I just got back from Japan and went straight to Worlds in San Francisco. Plus, my Dictaphone with an Itaru Ishida interview seems to have eaten the tape and has not regurgitated anything remotely useable. Live Worlds Coverage kicked off yesterday and will be ongoing all week. I will be following a player around all day today during the draft portion. Perhaps two-time Limited Pro Tour winner Nicolai Herzog would be a good candidate? Nicolai and Gabriel Nassif are in a heated battle to unseat Kai Budde as the player of the year. Kai is not to be discounted though as a second place finish here would likely earn him another year of free trips and cushy hotel rooms.

So don't worry about The Week That Was, go check out the Week That Is all weekend long at the [Tournament Center](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/tournamentcenter).
