I've known John and Traci Seaton for a long, long, time. John was a regular at my local card store when I returned to *Magic* in January 1997, which, now that I think about it, means I've known him nearly half my life. I've never forgotten that John taught me how to shuffle a deck of cards, and recommended practicing it while watching TV.


Traci had originally played *Magic* during *Ice Age*, and after meeting John in 1999, was eventually persuaded to come back to the game during *Onslaught* block. At the time, I was judging most of our local events, and Traci joined our small judge team, bringing invaluable experience from her time working in Casino surveillance. It was almost comical watching less reputable players wither under her scrutiny.


On the 11th of October 2008, John and Traci were married, and I was honoured to be asked to do a reading as part of the ceremony. Despite being a (somewhat over) confident public speaker, I remember being very nervous. I guess knowing how important the occasion was to them, I was terrified of doing something silly, which is pretty standard for me.

*John and Traci have been happily married for 7 years now.*


You may have noticed that today is also the 11th of October, which makes this their seventh wedding anniversary (you may thank me, and call me "Sherlock".) Many people in committed relationships might be tempted to say, "it's ok dear, we'll do something special today instead," but luckily for John, an event like this *is* special for them both, because it's their bi-annual trip away to hang out with the many long-time friends they've made within the Australia/New Zealand *Magic* community. And by "friends" I mean me.


And I say "luckily" for John, because he's currently 11-1 and sitting at the top of the standings going into the second draft, which could very well make this an anniversary to remember. You might think I would be rooting for John today, but as an un-biased coverage representative, you know of course, that I couldn't possibly comment.
