The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 2, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by the last day of individual *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* previews.


Today's Previews
================


1. [Ode to Blood Moon—Exclusive MM3 Preview](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/ode-to-blood-moon-exclusive-mm3-preview?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

SaffronOlive might be the biggest [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) fan on the planet, so who else would we get to preview the most hateful of all cards in Modern?


1. Such Justice. Much Fire.

1. [Exclusive *Modern Masters 2017* Preview Card for Magic: The Gathering – MTG!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhQo9suWKNA) | The Mana Source | Wedge

Wedge is beyond excited for this one. His words. Not mine. But, with a preview this sweet, he has good reason to be.


1. I accept this fact.

1. [Previews for *Modern Masters 2017 Edition*](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/modern-masters-2017-edition/) | Top Level Podcast | Mike Flores and [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum), er, Patrick Chapin

Aaaaand we've found my dream scenario for every draft I do with this set. Both of these cards are near and dear to the hosts hearts, and they share some stories from the glorious past where these cards ruled Standard.


1. [*Modern Masters 2017* Spoiler - PAUPERGANDA!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZfngqY9YUg)

Short, sweet, and slickly put together, this preview video introduces a new member of the Pauper format.

1. [Snack Time #50: Modern Masters 2017 Preview](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/snacktimewithmikeandant-03020217-snack-time-50-modern-masters-2017-preview/) | Gathering Magic | Mike Linnemann and Ant Tessitore

Sweet uncommon, even sweeter art.


1. [ЭКСКЛЮЗИВ: ИЛЛЮСТРАЦИИ К СЕТУ *Magic: The Gathering Modern Masters 2017*](http://www.mirf.ru/art/mtg-modern-masters-2017) | Mir Fantastiki

I have no idea what the article says, but I definitely recognize all of those pictures!


Still to Come
=============


1. It's The Final Mythic

There's one more Mythic Rare waiting to be previewed, and [@elainechase](https://twitter.com/ElaineChase) will be on the case!


1. Last Day of Previews

What does that mean? It means tomorrow is the full preview cycle, and if I find the time and am feeling saucy, I might throw out a few more previews here and there, on my Twitter ([@blakepr](https://twitter.com/blakepr)), the official Wizards account ([@Wizards\_Magic](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic)), or another Wizards of the Coast–affiliated account. But only if you're good.
