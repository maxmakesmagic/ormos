Carlos Barrado won Grand Prix Madrid some time ago with a Necro-Donate deck, while Raul Mestre made Top 8 at Grand Prix Valencia. Both are Spanish top players meeting at the feature match table.

### Game 1

After some chatting they got on their way.

Both players kept their hands and Carlos dropped a [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), which attacked next turn. A Milkin joins Barrado's forces. Raul Didn't seem to have anything to cast even having three mana and had to look without any chance at a [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) He then cast an [Aven Smokeweaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Smokeweaver), which held all of the opposing army at bay. Raul needed some black mana to play some spells but instead he got a [Krosan Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Archer) out. His opponent in the meantime kept swinging at him with the [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger). 

Mestre was much more satisfied with what he drew and how the board situation looked like so he swinged once with his Aven.   


Finally Carlos seemed to be alive and played an [Amugaba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amugaba), which got Persuaded to the other side. Things seem to be really getting grim for Barrado. Still, he killed his [Amugaba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amugaba) with a combination of two spells and his [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger). The four for one trade didn't seem to help his situation and kept him taking blows from the Smokeweaver leaving him with six life.

Carlos wasted away the opposing Aven and used his Lavamancer on the [Scrivener](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrivener). Mestre didn't seem to slow down when he finally got his black mana to use a [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire) to kill the pesky Lavamancer. 

Raul dropped a [Narcissism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcissism) and attacked. With two creatures on the board on his side and a Milkin on the other, Barrado at only four life conceded.

Mestre 1- 0 Barrado

### Game 2

This time Mestre opted for the mulligan going down to six cards.

He started by dropping a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and a [Diligent Farmhand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diligent+Farmhand), that stroke next turn. Carlos on the other hand played an [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) to stop the little farmer only to see Raul sacrificing it to get the swamp he needed. After a Chainer's edict Raul played an [Aven Windreader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Windreader) to start the hostilities. Without any better answer Carlos replayed his [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) after having played [Morgue Theft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morgue+Theft). A [Nantuko Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Disciple) joined Mestre's forces but left not much later with a [Crippling Fatigue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Fatigue).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbar02/a964.jpg)When Mestre used his creature's ability his opponent wasted it away. In retaliation Mestre flashbacked a [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) to clean up the board.  

An [Anarchist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist) on Carlos's side seemed to be unanswered since Raul kept drawing land.

A freshly cast Lavamancer got hit by [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire) leaving the [Anarchist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist) to continue beating Mestre. 

After some time with Raul holding almost only lands he persuaded a small creature in signs of desperation. An [Aura Graft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aura+Graft) from Barrado's side turned the situation around and his opponent conceded.

Mestre 1- 1 Barrado

### Game 3

Mestre started and dropped a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) on his second turn. After that he cast a [Narcissism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcissism) to worsen the board situation for Barrado. Carlos cast an [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and a Hydromorphic Guardian. He attacked with both his creatures and discarded a [Amugaba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amugaba) to switch [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba)'s power. Then he played [Zombify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify) to put the big snake into play. 

What had seemed to be a certain win with a very good start for Raul had turned into a certain loss with such big fatties on the other side. Even after pounding his deck, Mestre seemed to find no answer and went down to eight life. Although he had [Persuasion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion) in his hand to snatch the [Amugaba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amugaba), the Hydromorphic Guardian's ability can counter it so he dropped an [Aven Windreader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Windreader) to chump. Next turn the [Amugaba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amugaba) got through and Carlos held a [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) to search for a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to get the two remaining life down to zero with the [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) he was holding.

**Final Result:** Mestre 1 â€“ 2 Barrado
