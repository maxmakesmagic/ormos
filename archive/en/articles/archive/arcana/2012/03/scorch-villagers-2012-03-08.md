If you live in a world where there's a **Magic** set going on, you're going to have to accept the occasional dragon attack. And the worst part is that when you get attacked, you might not even be visible on the card.

Even when the art gets blown up, the dragon tends to pull focus.

So here's our tribute to the tiny, tiny people at the bottom of [Scorch the Fields](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scorch+the+Fields), who are just trying to get through their day.
