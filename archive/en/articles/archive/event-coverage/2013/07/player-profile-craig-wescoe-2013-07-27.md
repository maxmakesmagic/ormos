There are very few players as associated with a deck archetype as Craig Wescoe is with White Weenie. Having run a variant of the deck in seemingly every tournament he's ever played, Wescoe was most recently paid back for his loyalty with a win at Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze*, riding [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) and [Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm) (slightly larger than a weenie) to an effortless win.


Virtually always suited up in a blazer for major events, the Tennessee **Magic** player has been around the game for an incredibly long time, cracking the Top 8 of three different Pro Tours (all in California), all with White Weenie variants. It's no surprise that Wescoe lists California as his favorite place to play **Magic**!


As a result of his long tenure within the Pro ranks, Wescoe feels very comfortable with the other players in the 2013 **Magic** World Championship, which should make him feel right at home. While he may be outside of California for this event, he can at least take solace in the fact that he has four different formats, and consequently four different chances, to recruit a White Weenie army.
