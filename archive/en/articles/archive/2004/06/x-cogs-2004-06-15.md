The ["cog" theme](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr125) of *Fifth Dawn* pertains to zero- and one-mana artifacts. [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) and [Artificer's Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificer%27s+Evolution) can search them up and [Auriok Salvagers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Salvagers), [Leonin Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Squire) and [Salvaging Station](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salvaging+Station) can re-use them.


But keep in mind that if a card has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, the amount is treated as zero for the purposes of determining converted mana cost. So cards with only ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif)s in their mana costs are, you guessed it, cogs.


Here's a list of cards that you might have missed for your cog decks because of that ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif).


**[Phyrexian Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Marauder)** - It's an artifact creature from *Visions* that you can make as big as you please.


**[Shifting Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shifting+Wall)** - This artifact wall from *Stronghold* can be a useful thing to tutor for when you're facing down a large attacker.


**[Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives)** - Although you play it with lots of colors, its converted mana cost is still ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif) -- and it's a great way to rid yourself of problematic permanents.


**[Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void)** - Remember, *all*  ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif)s are treated as zero! So you can search up a Chalice when you know your opponent has spells of a certain cost that you want to stop.
