We're not quite done with our 25th Anniversary yet! We've got one more trick up our sleeves for 2018, and it's something quite special—the last *Masters* set we plan on making for a while. We tried not to hold back.


Announcing *Ultimate Masters*. And it's coming soon. Very soon.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/QVzgfnO2CP.png)


***Ultimate Masters***


**Release Date**: December 7, 2018


* 254 Cards
* 24 packs per box
* 15-card booster packs, one premium foil per pack
* English and Japanese languages with global distribution
* One Ultimate Box Topper per box
* MSRP\*: $335.76 per box; $34.99 per 3-pack blisterpack (\*MSRP applies to United States only)
* Supplies are limited

Additionally, *Ultimate Masters* will be available on *Magic Online* starting December 7 for $6.99 per pack. It will not be redeemable.


Let's start with the big news—yes, we're shelving the *Masters* series for the foreseeable future. We are instead focusing on other products that will also include reprints. We'll talk more about those when the time comes, but we're sending off the *Masters* product line for the time being with this premium take on the *Masters* series, *Ultimate Masters*.


Now, on to that box topper. Or should I say, those box toppers. All 40 of them.


Every box will come with a sealed pack containing a single box topper, sealed inside the box. The pack will look a little something like this:


![Box topper pack](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/yYzOvwdR8g.png)


Open it up, and you'll get one of 40 different cards (you can check out the list below) with extended art, like this:


![Liliana of the Veil](https://media.wizards.com/2018/uma/en_M19CU6Uoed.png)


This set of 40 box topper cards includes extended art versions of some of *Magic*'s most popular cards, including every mythic rare in the set, many of the rare cards, and two uncommons—[Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) and [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness)—that are among the most beloved in *Magic*'s history. Every box topper also has a main set counterpart, just with a normal frame treatment. So in the same box, you could pull both of these:

Because we're releasing this product *in just one month*, we're showing you every box topper right here! You can see all of them at the bottom of the page, along with their regular-set counterpart.


Note that the box toppers will be distributed by treasure chests on *Magic Online*.


The packaging for *Ultimate Masters* will look a little something like this.

Finally, yes, we want to acknowledge that *Ultimate Masters* has an MSRP (US only) higher than previous *Masters* products. We're sending the *Masters* series off in the style it deserves: *Ultimate Masters* is a limited run, premium set that is unique and collectible. We understand that it might not be for everyone. And that's okay. If you're looking for a unique, cool product with a collectible twist, then *Ultimate Masters* might be up your alley.


And if it is for you, here are what the box toppers will look like, along with their main-set counterparts. We'll show off the rest of the set starting November 19 here on DailyMTG and around the web.
