Magic Online Leaderboard Points
-------------------------------


Monthly Events and Playoff Events include MOCS Leaderboard Points as prizes. These are not physical objects tracked in your collection, but are instead tracked on this page.


Two leaderboards will be posted. The MOCS Yearly Leaderboard will include all MOCS Leaderboard Points awarded in all Monthly and Playoff events in the 2016 *Magic Online* Championship Series. The MOCS Quarterly Leaderboard will include only MOCS Leaderboard Points awarded in Monthly Events after the most recent Playoff Event.


These leaderboards will be updated no later than the Wednesday following a Monthly or Playoff event, and will be used to determine qualifications for Playoff Events and the *Magic Online* Championship. The first of these updates will be posted to this page following the first Monthly Event.
