 Red Aggro hasn't gotten too much love lately. The field is clouded with midrange decks and splashy 4/5s and 3/4s. In fact, the only guy that gobbles the attention in red is [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster). Very little gets mentioned about the red 1/1s. But when you scan the top tables at Grand Prix Los Angeles, there are plenty of red beaters getting on the battlefield. I walked around the top tables to see what was going on.




 There are three distinct red decks. There's the White-Red (or Mono-Red) Heroic-based strategy that looks to abuse synergies like Soldier creature types (thanks [Obelisk of Urd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obelisk+of+Urd)), or Heroic triggers. There's the "Boss Sligh" Mono-Red Aggro deck, based on Tom Ross's build that goes for the "sligh" mentality of perfect creature/burn curve. Then there's Brad Nelson's White-Red Aggro "MAC" that can play as midrange, aggro, or control depending on the match-up and whether you're on the draw or the play [hence M.A.C.]. Each version has its champions.
