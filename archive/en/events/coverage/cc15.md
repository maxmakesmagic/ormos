Community Battles Back!
=======================




The Community Team managed to battle back from a deficit to win the 2015 *Magic* Community Cup!
















2015 *Magic* Community Cup

DAY 2 COVERAGE




 The Community Team has won the 2015 *Magic* Community Cup! Congratulations to Gabe Reale, Anthony D’Aconto, Meghan Wolff, Maria Bartholdi, Kenji Egashira, Adam Styborski, Jimmy Wong, and Joel Larsson for their spectacular performance over what has been an action-packed and flavor-filled weekend of fun and games. Whether bringing us to the edge of our seats with their immersive storytelling or making our hearts skip a beat due to sheer intensity, the Community Team never failed to provide us an excellent representation of why our community is so freaking awesome.




 It really came down to the wire, too! The Wizards team was leading throughout the day, but the Ironroot Chef rounds brought it to within two points. In the final round, it came down to the last three matches. After getting fairly demolished at *Battle for Zendikar* Sealed Deck on Saturday, it was uncertain if they could overcome even a two-point deficit to take the lead. But they buckled down and absolutely demolished the Wizards team, putting three team members through to a perfect 3-0 record! It was a dramatic victory, and you could actually feel the immense tension that had built up to that point burst and rush out of the room as the final match came to completion.




 This year’s Community Cup team is filled with wonderful members of the *Magic* community, men and women who are great contributors and content creators for the game we all love. They do us proud with the things they create every day, and, this weekend, they certainly did the entire community proud with this massive victory. Congratulations once again to the Community team for their victory at the 2015 *Magic* Community Cup!

Welcome to Ironroot Chef, where our illustrious chefs work to create delectable cuisine, capable of sating even the most ravenous of judges. This year, rather than create a bevy of small plates to...








DAY 1 COVERAGE



It has been a close match, all day long, but the Wizards team finished strong with a 6-2 final round, and they lead the Community team 78-66!


Bombs have been dropped, insults have been hurled, and, most importantly, matches have been won. The first day of play here at the 2015 Community Cup started off with the notoriously fun Stipulation Cube Draft! Wild stipulations ruled the morning, from playing with only one half of the alphabet to building the perfect disaster movie. After three rounds of blockbuster play, the Community team had carved a nice lead for themselves, up 12 points headed into the second half of the day.



 From there, though, things fell apart for them. *Battle for Zendikar* Sealed Deck made its debut here at the Magic Community Cup, and, at first, it looked like the stars were aligned in the Community's favor. Gabe Reale, you may know him better as MTGODoc, cracked the world's first *Zendikar Expeditions* card: a foil, full-art Hallowed Fountain. As good a portent as that was, it didn't translate to the actual play, where the Wizards team steamrolled the Community, winning six of the final eight matches to end the day up 12 points.




 Tomorrow, the Community Cup returns, and with it a chance for the Community team to redeem itself. Up first in the morning is the delicious Ironroot Chef format, followed by *Battle for Zendikar* Draft. Larger deficits have been overcome before, so it's still anyone's cup.
