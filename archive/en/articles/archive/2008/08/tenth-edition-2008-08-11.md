The **Magic: The Gathering** core set presents **Magic** in its truest form. This painstakingly crafted compilation acts as a "greatest hits" collection, a foundation to start building your own collection, a reliable place to find some of the most powerful tournament-defining cards, and a practical guide to the fundamentals of the game.


This is the tenth version of the core set in the history of the game, and it stands out from all others for one unprecedented reason: The inclusion of legends. They're powerful, they're fun, and they've never been seen in a core set before.
