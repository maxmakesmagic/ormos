* [Sealed Deck](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/sealeddeck) with a Top 8 [Booster Draft](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/boosterdraft) playoff *or* a playoff with Sealed Decks used in the Swiss rounds. Check with your local organizer for full details.

For information on the product mix for Sealed Deck and Booster Draft events, please refer to Appendix D of the [*Magic* Tournament Rules](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules).


Contact the store running your next Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier to find out the format that they are running.




* Swiss rounds will be each of 50 minutes in length.
* Single-elimination playoff matches will have no time limit.
* All players may participate in all Swiss rounds.
* The top players after the final Swiss round will advance to the single-elimination playoff. The number of players that advanced to the playoff is based on the number of players in the event.

Number of Swiss rounds and number of players that advance to the playoffs is based on attendance according to the chart found on Appendix E of the [*Magic* Tournament Rules](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules).




* Playoff matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Playoff matches will be single-elimination.
* While there are no time limits in the playoff rounds, players are expected to play at a reasonable pace and finish their matches within 60 minutes.
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the playoff, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each playoff match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
* If the playoff is Booster Draft, the players in the playoff will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The playoff bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* A playoff may be conducted using Sealed Decks from the Swiss rounds of the tournament as long as the tournament organizer announces this at the start of the tournament.
