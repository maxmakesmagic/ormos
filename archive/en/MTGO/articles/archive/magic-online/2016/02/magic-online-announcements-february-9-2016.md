**Upcoming *Oath of the Gatewatch* Streamer Showdown February 25**


If you've never seen a Streamer Showdown before, they come in two eight-player pods that feature some of the best streamers in the community brawling with the latest *Magic Online* sets. If you're trying to improve your game, *Magic Online* streamers are some of the best players out there—and some of the best teachers, too. Even if you're already a *Magic* pro, throw your support behind one of the competitors and cheer them on from their Twitch chat!


This Streamer Showdown will be an *Oath of the Gatewatch*/*Battle for Zendikar* Draft event! The full lineup will be posted next Tuesday, February 16. Until then, mark your calendar for the day of the event, **Thursday, February 25**, and set aside some time to watch the pods launching at 1:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time (UTC -8)!

**Replay Reminder**


Due to an update to how mana is autoconsumed, some replays will no longer be viewable after the February 10 downtime. Players who have replays they want to view should make sure to do so prior to the downtime or use another method, such as screen capture software, to record games they wish to save.

***Oath of the Gatewatch* Release Known Issues**


***Oath of the Gatewatch* Cards**


* Cardset | Players are incorrectly unable to undo [Kozilek's Translator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Translator)‘s activated ability.
* Cardset | When a player casts [Kozilek, the Great Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+the+Great+Distortion), its triggered ability incorrectly triggers if the casting player has seven or more cards in hand. Upon resolution, the player will not draw cards if he or she already has seven or more cards in hand.
* Cardset | If a player controls multiple [Endbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endbringer)s, only one will untap during other players’ untap steps as intended.
* Cardset | In certain circumstances, [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) incorrectly exiles creature tokens created by [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet).
* Cardset | Cards that ask players to choose a basic land type incorrectly include the option to choose Wastes. If a player attempts to choose Wastes, he or she will be asked to choose a basic land type again. Wastes are basic lands, but are not a basic land type.
* Cardset | [Crumble to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumble+to+Dust) incorrectly causes the player to search the library of the land’s controller, not owner.
* Cardset | Several prompt boxes are incorrect or uninformative. Affected cards include [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet), [Harvester Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harvester+Troll), and [Devour in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Flames).

**Gameplay**


* Cardset | Abilities that reduce mana costs are not correctly being applied to additional costs (such as buyback or multikicker).
* Cardset | If [Deceiver of Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+of+Form)’s triggered ability turns creatures into copies of a Legendary creature, the legend rule fails to apply to the copies.
* Cardset | If [Kozilek's Pathfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Pathfinder) loses its abilities (perhaps it was given a [Gift of Tusks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Tusks)), creatures previously affected by its activated ability will incorrectly be able to block it.
* Cardset | [Narset, Enlightened Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset%2C+Enlightened+Master)’s triggered ability does not allow players to cast split spells (such as [Fire & Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+%2F%2F+Ice)).
* Duel Scene | If a player uses the Undo keyboard shortcut (default: Ctrl+Z) during the declaration of blockers to undo a block, combat damage will be incorrectly dealt. Combat damage from attacking creatures will ignore the undo command, and combat damage from blocking creatures will respect the player’s decision. For example, if a player blocks an attacking 3/3 with two 2/2 creatures, then cancels one of the blocks with the keyboard shortcut, the attacking creature will deal two damage to one blocker and one to the other, but will take only two damage from combat.
* General | Windows 10 may display an error message that *Magic Online* is an unrecognized application while downloading the client. In order to successfully download the client, click the “More Info” link, then “Run Anyway”.
