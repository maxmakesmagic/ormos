Have you ever collected a particular card, or type of cards?

Kelly Digges: Just about everybody I've talked to has collected something. You'd figure more people would collect their favorite cards, but most of the people I know ended up collecting some weird thing that nobody else wanted.


Take me, for example. Back in the day, I loved [Shivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon), but there was no way I was going to actually accumulate a large number of them. I was a huge Thallid fan, but I didn't actually need a huge pile of Fungus-I needed enough to put in a deck, and then I was done. No, I collected [Orcish Conscripts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Conscripts). For some reason.

I think it started when I was making a trade that had ended up just slightly in their favor. I asked for my trading partner to sweeten the deal, and he jokingly suggested throwing in two [Orcish Conscripts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Conscripts) that he happened to have nearby. I knew they were terrible. He knew they were terrible. We had a good laugh about it, and then, what the heck, I took the deal.


And of course, the thing about collecting something nobody else wants is that it's really easy to get people to give it to you. Nor was that the only appeal-[Orcish Conscripts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Conscripts) is really pretty funny, with the propeller beanie and the nose picking and whatnot. I made it known to all my friends that I was collecting [Orcish Conscripts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Conscripts).


I ended up with a couple dozen of them before my local pool ran out, although I was never sure about those white-bordered Fifth Edition ones. I collected them before they were in a core set, man.
