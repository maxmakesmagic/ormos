The Grand Prix Team Sealed day starts like no other Grand Prix. Because of pool registrations, pool verifications, then an extra-long (sixty-minute) deck building period, the teams are seated for a few hours before they get into the first match-up.


During this time, the only sounds in the tournament room are the booming voice of head judge Jared Sylva, and the hushed tones at the team tables deciphering how best to build their complex pools. Even with the "additional" time to build the decks, every team is crunched to make sure everything is set right and properly registered. Precious few, if any, teams finish early and leave their table to chat amongst their friends. Pros who usually discuss their draft or sealed build jovially in the time before the first round, are intent and focused.


"We're going to take the full sixty minutes to build," were the only words out of No. 4 Reid Duke when reached to say a few words about the building process. His Grand Prix Portland champion team of (1) Owen Turtenwald and (9) William Jensen sat, quietly discussing their build.
