After 15 hard-fought rounds of Standard, with a total of 1,162 others eliminated, only eight players remained in the running. Their Top 8 performance came with invitations and airfare to Pro Tour *Ixalan* in Albuquerque…and the opportunity to fight for the Grand Prix trophy.

**Hometown**: Adelaide, Australia


**Occupation:** Accountant / Magic Grinder


**Number of byes:** 2


**Previous Magic accomplishments**: A few Pro Tours and Grand Prix Top 16s.


**What Standard deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?** Esper Aggro – great Marvel and U/R Control matchup. I wanted to play an aggressive deck in this metagame that had permission.


**What were the best cards in your main deck, and why?** [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) (single-handedly wins matches) and [Irrigated Farmland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irrigated+Farmland) (fixes the flooding and smooths draws).


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Skysovereign, Consul Flagship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skysovereign%2C+Consul+Flagship) – when it resolved it ensured I won the close games.


**What are your most important cards against Temur Marvel decks, and what is the match-up about?** [Metallic Rebuke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metallic+Rebuke) and [Spell Queller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Queller) – they allow me to play permission and stop [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) or their energy once I have small creatures in play.

**What Standard deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?** R/G Pummeler. It's so explosive.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Electrostatic Pummeler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Pummeler).


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Magma Spray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Spray).


**What are your most important cards against Temur Marvel decks, and what is the match-up about?** Just be quick, and hope they miss with [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) :)

**Age**: 31


**Hometown**: Hannover, Germany


**Occupation:** Tax Consultant Assistant


**Number of byes:** 2


**Previous Magic accomplishments**: Attended some PPTQs (with little success).


**What Standard deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?** Blue-Red Control. I expected mostly Marvel and U/R on Day 2 and felt comfortable with my deck in those match-ups. My prediction turned out to be wrong, but the deck carried me.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk). Because UHulk!


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Kefnet the Mindful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kefnet+the+Mindful). Blocks everything and single-handedly wins the mirror.


**What are your most important cards against Temur Marvel decks, and what is the match-up about?** Lots of counterspells and card draw. It's about not falling behind and gaining incremental advantages from turn four on.

**Age**: 27


**Hometown**: Prague, Czech Republic


**Occupation:** Magic


**Number of byes:** 3


**Previous Magic accomplishments**: Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* Champion.


**What Standard deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?** B/G Constrictor. Shaun McLaren built a great deck so Thomas Hendriks, Ivan Floch, and I tested it and played it. Most of the played decks now are good-ish matchups.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Winding Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor).


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Grasp of Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Darkness).


**What are your most important cards against Temur Marvel decks, and what is the match-up about?** Them not hitting [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) on the first spin so you can destroy [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) with [Dissenter's Deliverance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissenter%27s+Deliverance). It is important to keep pressure on them. [Dispossess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispossess) is good in most games.

**Age**: 23


**Hometown**: Zeist, Netherlands


**Occupation:** Master student


**Number of byes:** 1


**Previous Magic accomplishments**: Pro Tour *Kaladesh* 8-8 through RPTQ.


**What Standard deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?** Temur Marvel. Before this Standard, my deck was Saheeli combo. Value-based midrange decks with a strong combo element are my favorite.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger), both through [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) and via [Shrine of the Forsaken Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+the+Forsaken+Gods) the card is absurd. I beat U/R by hard-casting three in a row, putting my opponent to one land.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Confiscation Coup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscation+Coup). When the best cards in your deck are [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker) and [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel), stealing them is pretty good in the mirror.


**What are your most important cards against Temur Marvel decks, and what is the match-up about?** As mentioned before, turn-four Ulamog game one, and Trackers and Coup post-board. Pre-board it's a combo race; post-board it's a grind with counterspells and Trackers.

**Age**: 24


**Hometown**: Leiden, Netherlands


**Occupation:** Student


**Number of byes:** 3


**Previous Magic accomplishments**: 2 Grand Prix Top 8s and 1 Pro Tour Top 8.


**What Standard deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?** B/G Tracker because it's a deck with a lot of late game that can also explode and win fast (which is nice versus Marvel).


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker). Doesn't matter how it happens, if the game goes longer you are doing great.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Grasp of Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Darkness). (Thanks to Martin Dang). Makes [Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer) less unbeatable!


**What are your most important cards against Temur Marvel decks, and what is the match-up about?** [Dispossess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispossess). Forces the game into a midrange game, with them having bad/dead cards. (Spoiler: B/G often wins those midrange games.)

**Age**: 26


**Hometown**: Ringe, Germany


**Occupation:** Finished study


**Number of byes:** 0


**Previous Magic accomplishments**: Multiple FNM wins, lol.


**What Standard deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?** I chose B/G because I don't like Marvel and play too slow to execute control decks. I had all cards (mostly) from the previous Standard.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Winding Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor). It makes the whole deck viable with the synergies.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Transgress the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind) and [Dispossess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispossess). Taking Marvel on turn 3 feels good.


**What are your most important cards against Temur Marvel decks, and what is the match-up about?** Having a fast clock game one and a good sideboard for games two and three.

**Age**: 30


**Hometown**: Osnabrück, Germany


**Occupation:** Pharmacist


**Number of byes:** 2


**Previous Magic accomplishments**: Several wins of local tournaments, PTQ Top 8, SSS Top 8.


**What Standard deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?** Green-Black Energy. I tested a lot on Blue-Red Control and didn't feel safe on the Marvel match-up. So this was a last-minute choice inspired by Jonathan Rowe.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Glint-Sleeve Siphoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint-Sleeve+Siphoner). It felt like the better [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant).


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Dispossess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispossess). I like Magic and not gambling.


**What are your most important cards against Temur Marvel decks, and what is the match-up about?** [Transgress the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind) and [Dispossess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispossess). Pre-board I lost a lot against them. Post-board it felt a lot better.
