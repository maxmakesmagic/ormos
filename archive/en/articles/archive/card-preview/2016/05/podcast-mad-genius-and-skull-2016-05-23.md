Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






"So you just win, right?"


That was the reaction of Erik "Mad Genius" Lauer when he first saw today's preview card:

Lauer—a member of the *Magic: The Gathering* Hall of Fame and current principle game designer in R&D—sat down with me to discuss the history of Necropotence. In this short podcast, he lets us know why "the skull" is one of the best cards ever printed.
