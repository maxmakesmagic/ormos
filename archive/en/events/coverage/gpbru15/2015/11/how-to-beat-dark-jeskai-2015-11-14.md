Dark Jeskai was one of the decks to beat in Standard this weekend. I sought out the advice of experienced players regarding the best card, best deck, or best game plan for beating it.

*Ondřej Stráský*


**No. 16-ranked Ondřej Stráský:** "Practice and practice, because the deck can be tough to play against at first. If you want a specific card, then play [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon)—the ramp deck has a good matchup against Jeskai, for instance."

*Fabrizio Anteri*


**No. 22-ranked Fabrizio Anteri:** "Play Esper tokens. It's the best Gideon deck, and [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) is the best way to get around [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command). Esper Tokens also has [Silkwrap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silkwrap) to exile both [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) and [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider), so it's the best removal spell against them."

*Magnus Lantto*


**Magic Online Champion Magnus Lantto:** "I like going wide. Token decks are pretty good against Dark Jeskai because they go around all their card advantage spells. Also, [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) is a good plan."

*Michael Bonde*


**Grand Prix Madrid 2015 semifinalist Michael Bonde:** "You need cards that are not vulnerable to [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command) or their spot removal. [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) and [Exert Influence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exert+Influence) are good examples."

*Matej Zatlkaj*


**Gold level pro Matej Zatlkaj:** "Play around [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command) and [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command). Try not to give them an opportunity for a two-for-one."

*Thomas Hendriks*


**WMC competitor badge collector Thomas Hendriks:** "Have the right threats against their mix of removal spells, or disrupt them with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). The ramp deck is great against them too when you start chaining Ulamogs."

*Martin Müller*


**Pro Tour Battle for Zendikar quarterfinalist Martin Müller:** "If you're playing Jeskai yourself, then add more late-game cards. The combination of removal spells to ensure you don't die in the early game and cards like [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) or [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) to go over the top when the game goes long, is where you want to be."
