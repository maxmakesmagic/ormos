The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 11, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by all the *Magic* streaming content you can handle. Maybe even more than that. I don't know your life.


What to Watch Today
===================


1. *Ixalan* Standard Scuffle | LoadingReadyRun | [twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun](https://go.twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun) | 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET/11 p.m. UTC

I could try to write something clever and funny here. Or I could just let actual professional funny people tell you about it. So watch this video instead.

1. *Magic: The Gathering Arena* Dev Stream | [twitch.tv/magic](https://go.twitch.tv/magic) | 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET/8 p.m. UTC

Today's stream will focus on why the cards look the way they do. There will be questions, there will be answers, there will be more information, and there will be people talking toward the camera. What more do you want out of a dev stream?


1. Magic Mics | [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://go.twitch.tv/magicmics) | 8 p.m. PT/11 p.m. ET/3 a.m. UTC

You might as well just keep the *Magic* streams going, as Magic Mics will fire up later this evening to discuss—well, probably some of the things that happen in the earlier streams. Streamception, if you will.


Top 25
======


1. Worlds Rises

With only 24 players active this past weekend, those players got a major leg up on the Top 25 rankings this week. Every single player who rose in the rankings did so thanks to the *Magic* World Championship. William Jensen—your 2017 World Champion—rose a whopping five spots and now finds himself ranked No. 7 in the world. His teammate, Reid Duke, rose two places to No. 2. But the big risers were Sam Black, who leapt seven spots, and Gerry Thompson, who re-entered the rankings at No. 23.


But it was not all good news for Worlds competitors, as many of them did drop. And last year's World Champion, Brian Braun-Duin, also fell. Matt Severa also fell out of the rankings after being displaced by Thompson.

After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Analyzing Osyp's Epic Bluff](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/analyzing-osyps-epic-bluff/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

At first, I thought this article was a bit of a lark. The bluff in question involved Osyp getting in for a point of damage early in a match where Owen Turtenwald didn't want to risk his powerful [Shapers of Nature](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapers+of+Nature). I think the consensus was that most players wouldn't have made that block there, many wouldn't have made the attack in the first place, and it was mostly a fun moment with Osyp enjoying getting one over on Turtenwald in a low-stakes situation.


But Karsten doesn't do anything halfway. He acknowledges that line of thought, then goes deep—Frank Karsten Math deep (that's a thing)—on the attack, whether to block or not, and the percentages behind everything. It's eye-opening how a small moment like that can unfold so many lines of thought.


1. [Commander VS: The Understudies](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35987_Commander-VS-The-Understudies.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

The crew takes some of the commanders from *Commander (2017 Edition)* who weren't the face cards and gives them the spotlight for at least one video. Then it's back in my *real* Commander deck when you're done, O-Kagachi!


1. [Binding of Ugin?? – Ixalan Lore and Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwH1reOFzvk) | Aether Hub | Seiben

There's a theory floating around the interwebs that Ugin is behind the magic preventing Planewalkers from leaving Ixalan. I honest-to-goodness have no idea if that theory is true or not, but Seiben puts the theory in video form.

1. [[Tournament Report] Worlds – Top 23](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/75cr6t/tournament_report_worlds_top23/) | Lucas Esper Berthoud

Come for the tongue-in-cheek title, stay for the excellent analysis.


1. *Explorers of Ixalan* Card Images

Basically all of Reddit this morning is card images from *Explorers of Ixalan*. Check out discussion threads on [Blatant Thievery](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/75hq6m/e02_blatant_thievery/), [Time Warp](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/75hpbn/e02_time_warp/), [Shared Animosity](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/75ii5z/e02_shared_animosity/), [Beacon of Immortality](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/75iing/e02_beacon_of_immortality/), [Quicksilver Amulet](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/75hpz9/mtge02_quicksilver_amulet/), [Aggravated Assault](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/75hqdj/mtge02_aggravated_assault/), and [Threads of Disloyalty](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/75hq5r/mtge02_threads_of_disloyalty/).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. Abzan Tokens

There were whispers of this deck prior to the World Championship last weekend, but no one ended up pulling the trigger—and some players regretted not giving it as stronger look.


Seth Manfield took up the mantle today on TCGplayer and posted four videos showing off the deck and running through three matches. I could explain things to you, but how about I let someone who actually plays *Magic* for a living (instead of making pithy jokes about it) talk about it.
