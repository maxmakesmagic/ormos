There are an extremely limited number of combat-relevant instants in *Avacyn Restored*. Because of this, you can plan out your attacks and blocks with an expert level of awareness of exactly what your opponent *could* have.

Of course it's true that even with a complete knowledge of what tricks are out there, you won't always be right. But if you're aware of the exact range of cards your opponent could have, then you're going to be able to make much better combat decisions than you would if you were blindly declaring your attacks and blocks.

After all, "I didn't think you had that" is much a better statement than "I didn't think of that at all." And being able to say (or at least think), "I knew you had that the whole time," is even better still.

To make this process easier for you, I've put together a guide with a complete color-by-color breakdown, as well as a cheat sheet for what to think about depending on how much mana your opponent has open.

If you're playing against a white deck, you need to be on your guard from the get-go.

[Cloudshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudshift), [Righteous Blow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Righteous+Blow), and [Zealous Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zealous+Strike) are all extremely easy to cast, and extremely relevant. They all threaten to put white players way ahead during the early stages of the game, and swing key combats in their favor later.

If your opponent has even a single [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) untapped, you should respect the possibility he or she could have a [Cloudshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudshift). This one-mana instant can be used to protect creatures from bounce, removal, and pump spellsâ€”as well as re-pair soulbond creatures and get an additional use out of creatures with enter-the-battlefield effects (like [Mist Raven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Raven)).

While [Cloudshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudshift) can be frustrating to play against, it has fairly limited applications, particularly if you don't have many removal spells. However, [Righteous Blow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Righteous+Blow) is cheap, versatile, and relatively difficult to play around. While you should be aware that your [Kruin Striker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kruin+Striker) could very easily eat it thanks to your opponent's [Righteous Blow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Righteous+Blow), it isn't the kind of card you should go out of your way to mitigate.

Your opponent is probably going to get a good creature with it. And you'd rather get your opponent to use it earlier rather than later, when you have a [Latch Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Latch+Seeker) or some other key evasion creature you desperately want to keep around.
