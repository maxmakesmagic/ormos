With only your five best Grand Prix finishes added to your Current Season Point Total, many of the top players are scrambling for Pro Points here at Grand Prix Taipei this weekend. The top players of the region are at attendance at the very last Grand Prix of the Pro Season, with the hopes of leveling up successfully.



This results in some rather interesting situations. For Lee Shi Tian, it probably doesn't matter since he is already Platinum. As for Kentaro Yamamoth and Nam Sung Wook, they are both locked for Platinum once they attend Pro Tour Portland which gives them the 3 Pro Points they need to cross the finish line.





|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Name** | **Current Season** 
**Point Total** | **GP1** | **GP2** | **GP3** | **GP4** | **GP5** |
| Lee Shi Tian | 46 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| Kentaro Yamamoto | 42 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| Nam Sung Wook | 42 | 8 | 4 | - | - | - |
| Shuhei Nakamura | 38 | 8 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 |
| Makihito Mihara | 34 | 5 | 2 | - | - | - |
| Shouta Yasooka | 31 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| Park Jun Young | 26 | 8 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| Kuo Tzu Ching | 23 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| Kelvin Chew | 22 | 3 | 3 | 2 | - | - |


However, Nam Sung Wook has only utilized two of his Grand Prix slots and will get bumped up to Platinum if he secures a Top 16 berth this weekend. If he manages that, he will be Platinum before the Pro Tour, which means he gets complimentary return airfare and the appearance fee of USD$3000. Kentaro Yamamoto will need a Top 8 to bump up his total to 45, since he has already chalked up at least five Grand Prix Pro Point finishes.



For Makihito Mihara, a Pro Point earned this weekend would put him at 35, giving him a USD$500 appearance fee at Portland. More importantly, he would only need a Top 25 instead of a Top 16 finish to secure Platinum. The one point could go a long way. On the other hand, Shouta Yasooka would need a Top 16 performance this weekend in order to improve his point total and lock up Gold Level.

| 1 | 30 | 1 | 8 |

| 3–4 | 22 | 3–4 | 5 |
| 5–8 | 20 | 5–8 | 4 |
