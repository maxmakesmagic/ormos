Date: 1718

![Jokulhaups](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jokulhaups)  

From [www.kidscosmos.org:](http://www.kidscosmos.org:)  

Function: noun  

Etymology: Icelandic *jökulhlaup*  

: a flood created when a body of water held by a glacial dam breaks through the confining walls**La·qua·tus**

![Ambassador Laquatus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ambassador+Laquatus)  

From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  

Function: proper noun  

Etymology: This sly, sinister character's name is a fusion of two pieces: *aqua*, which means water, and *loquacious*, which means "talkative." Since Laquatus is an underwater being who uses a lot of talk to get what he wants, this name describes him quite well.
