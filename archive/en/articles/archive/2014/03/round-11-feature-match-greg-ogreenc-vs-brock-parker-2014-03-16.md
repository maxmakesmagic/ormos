**The Players**


Greg Ogreenc has come into the public eye this past year thanks to a pair of Grand Prix Top 8s. His draft today is a three-color concoction featuring powerful mythics. Across from him is the venerable Brock Parker, beard enthusiast and Pro Tour Boston 2003 Champion as a member of The Brockafellars (teammates Hall of Famer Huey Jensen and Worlds '99 semifinalist Matt Linde). Parker pulled together a very fast White-Green deck with a diverse suite of tricks.


**The Match**


Parker was first on the board with [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon) but had no follow-up. Ogreenc played out [Bronze Sable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Sable) to block and a third-turn [Last Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) cleared it out. Still Parker couldn't find a decent threat. [Ephara's Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephara%27s+Warden) was not made to bash face. Things settled into a position where Ogreenc had [Arena Athlete](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena+Athlete) wearing [Leafcrown Dryad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad) attacking and Parker declining to block with [Nylea's Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary). He untapped and bestowed Shieldmate on the Emissary and swung all out for seven.

Ogreenc was flooding badly. His only other spells were [Mortal's Resolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortal%27s+Resolve) and [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave). He played it and fogged the Emissary. Parker's other creatures killed [Kiora](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave), but he had nothing to add to the board. Ogreenc drew [Snake of the Golden Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+of+the+Golden+Grove) which hit play as a 4/4, and decided to race. Resolve on his Athlete tapped the Emissary to drop Parker to just three life. The bad news was that Parker had been waiting on [Mortal's Ardor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortal%27s+Ardor), which combined with a bestowed [Observant Alseid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid) for a huge life swing. Ogreenc's topdecked [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) was no help, as Parker drew [Time to Feed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+to+Feed).


**Parker 1 - Ogreenc 0**


 


Ogreenc seemed torn during sideboarding. He went back to it once, then changed his mind and they were off. Parker opened with a strong sequence of [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon), Snarecaster tapping [Bronze Sable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Sable), and then [Elite Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Skirmisher). Ogreenc dropped [Pheres-Band Tromper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pheres-Band+Tromper) and tried to hold his ground. Parker thought for a moment, then played [Ordeal of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod) on the Skirmisher, tapping the Sable, and swung with all his creatures. Ogreenc put the Tromper in front of the Soldier. [Mortal's Ardor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortal%27s+Ardor) made it a one-for-two.


The bad news for Parker was that Ogreenc was sitting on [Time to Feed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+to+Feed). The Sable took one for the team to keep the Skirmisher from getting out of hand. He also summoned [Leafcrown Dryad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad) and passed. Parker passed a blank turn, keeping his Snarecaster at home. A Bestowed [Noble Quarry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Quarry) forced him to make another bad trade, this time his creature and [Acolyte's Reward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acolyte%27s+Reward) for the [Leafcrown Dryad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad).

So far, so good for Ogreenc, but his deck had other ideas. The only offence it offered him were some [Sedge Scorpion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedge+Scorpion)s. Parker was likewise short on action, but managed to find a [Cavalry Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalry+Pegasus) to bestow [Nyxborn Shieldmate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Shieldmate) onto. Ogreenc was forced to spend [Artisan's Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artisan%27s+Sorrow) on the Shieldmate to stay level and to desperately dig for his big threats. Two cards went to the bottom, but still he drew brick after brick. Parker matched him for a few turns, but then found [Phalanx Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader) and [Nylea's Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary), which were enough to take the match.


**Parker 2 - Ogreenc 0**  



 


First I sat down with Ogreenc for a post-mortem. My first question was if he had been considering siding out his blue in what looked like a very fast matchup. "Oh absolutely. The problem was, first I sided in [Artisan's Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artisan%27s+Sorrow), and if I take out blue there are other changes I'd need to make. My sideboard has a lot of options in it. Then I looked at the clock and we were already down to thirty minutes and [Parker] had presented his deck. I felt I couldn't make the change without going over sideboarding time so I decided to just go with it for game two and make the change in game three."


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave)
I asked him if he had any difficulties thanks to playing three colors and he shook his head. "My mana's actually really good. The only actual blue card I'm playing is [Kiora](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave), and my red is very light as well. Only Stormbreath is RR. So I get to play two islands, five mountains, [Unknown Shores](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unknown+Shores) and still have room for nine forests. And I have [Karametra's Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Favor)."


Later I caught up with Parker to get his take on how the match had gone. "I think I probably played bad. Both games my opening hands were not great. You know, I had all these tricks. I think I could've used them better. The Ordeal play, I don't know."


I told him that his deck seemed a lot better than it looked early in game one, what with the [Last Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) and [Ephara's Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephara%27s+Warden), and he laughed. "Yeah, I've got a couple stinkers for sure. The deck's really good overall, though. I have two Ordeals, lots of good creatures. After pack one I was worried I was going to open Elspeth and [Phalanx Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader) and have to pass Elspeth. Luckily I only opened [Phalanx Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader)."
