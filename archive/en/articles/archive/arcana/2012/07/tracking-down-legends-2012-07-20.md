There are five legendary creatures in ***Magic** 2013*: [Odric, Master Tactician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Odric%2C+Master+Tactician); [Talrand, Sky Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner); [Nefarox, Overlord of Grixis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nefarox%2C+Overlord+of+Grixis); [Krenko, Mob Boss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krenko%2C+Mob+Boss); and [Yeva, Nature's Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yeva%2C+Nature%27s+Herald). And if you pay attention, you can tell what plane each of them is from!


### Nefarox, Overlord of Grixis


![Nefarox, Overlord of Grixis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nefarox%2C+Overlord+of+Grixis)
  
[Nefarox, Overlord of Grixis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nefarox%2C+Overlord+of+Grixis) is an easy one to locate. It's right in Nefarox's name: Grixis! So Nefarox comes from the plane visited in *Shards of Alara* block, presumably before *Alara Reborn*, where the five shard-planes combined to reform Alara.


### Krenko, Mob Boss


![Krenko, Mob Boss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Krenko%2C+Mob+Boss)
  
[Krenko, Mob Boss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krenko%2C+Mob+Boss) is another easy one. In the flavor text, Krenko is described by Agmand Sarv, Azorius hussar:



> *"He displays a perverse charisma fueled by avarice. Highly dangerous. Recommend civil sanctions."   
>  â€”Agmand Sarv, Azorius hussar*

Azorius is one of the guilds of Ravnca, so that's where Krenko's from. The plane was visited in the original *Ravnica* block, and we're going back there this fall with *Return to Ravnica*.


You can learn more about Krenko in this week's [Uncharted Realms](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/204).


### Talrand, Sky Summoner


![Talrand, Sky Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner)
  
There's nothing on [Talrand, Sky Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner) that speaks to a specific plane. But [Talrand's Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%27s+Invocation) has further information!


![Talrand's Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Talrand%27s+Invocation)
  

> *After Talrand conquered the depths of Shandalar, his ambitions drove him skyward, joined by servants whose drive and curiosity equaled his own.*

Talrand, then, is from Shandalar, the home of the [five rings of ***Magic** 2013*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=%7C%5B%22Magic%202013%22%5D&name=+%5BRing%5D+%5Bof%5D).


### Yeva, Nature's Herald


![Yeva, Nature's Herald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Yeva%2C+Nature%27s+Herald)
  
[Yeva, Nature's Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yeva%2C+Nature%27s+Herald) also requires further investigation. [Yeva's Forcemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yeva%27s+Forcemage) has the flavor text to answer the question.


![Yeva's Forcemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Yeva%27s+Forcemage)
  

> *"Nature can't be stopped. It rips and tears at Ravnica's tallest buildings to claim its place in the sun."*


### Odric, Master Tactician


![Odric, Master Tactician](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Odric%2C+Master+Tactician)
  
[Odric, Master Tactician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Odric%2C+Master+Tactician) has a lot of rules text, so there's no room for explanation in the flavor text. And [Crusader of Odric](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusader+of+Odric) doesn't explicitly answer the question either.


![Crusader of Odric](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crusader+of+Odric)
  
Luckily, [Odric, Master Tactician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Odric%2C+Master+Tactician) has a *visual* cue. See the hilt of the sword Odric is holding? That's the symbol of Avacyn! Arcana has covered this symbol [in detail](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/809) ([twice, in fact](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/919)), so that definitely means that Odric is from the plane of Innistrad, as seen in *Innistrad*!


You can learn more about Odric in the [Uncharted Realms](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/201) from June 27, 2012.
