1,147 players are in Milan to say goodbye to *Theros* Block limited. At least on the big stage. In other words, it's the last chance to open that [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion), [Eidolon of Countless Battles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Countless+Battles) or [Dictate of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+Heliod) and ride them to victory all the way to Day Two, Top 8 and Pro Tour Khans of Tarkir in Honolulu.


To give a little taste of the format we've all fallen in love with the last eight months, we've cracked open a sealed pool that we'll let you at home build a deck from. Here's your chance to shine and see for yourselves how you would build it. Even though you haven't made the trip, you can enjoy building a sealed deck, without paying neither airfare nor tickets on *Magic Online*. Will it be a Black/White removal based deck with lots of ways to win in the late game? Or a Green/Black deck with both a good curve of creatures and removal?


You decide!
