Two weeks ago, Gerry Thompson got the first Pro Tour Top 8 of his career. And that gave him enough points to make Level 50 in Planeswalker Points! How rare is that? So rare that only eight people have done it:


Here's the complete list, the "Top 8," if you will:




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Worldwide Rank | Name | Planeswalker Points  | Level |
| 1 | Shuhei Nakamura | 76,457 | 50 (Archmage) |
| 2 | Raphael Levy | 71,885 | 50 (Archmage) |
| 3 | Olivier Ruel | 68,158 | 50 (Archmage) |
| 4 | Bram Snepvangers | 55,474 | 50 (Archmage) |
| 5 | Tomoharu Saito | 54,087 | 50 (Archmage) |
| 6 | Gerard Fabiano | 53,697 | 50 (Archmage) |
| 7 | Antoine Ruel | 52,890 | 50 (Archmage) |
| 8 | Gerry Thompson | 50,190 | 50 (Archmage) |

  
Ninth place currently belongs to Martin Juza, with 49,104 points.


But we're here to talk about Gerry! How did he get so many points? Well, by being very good at **Magic** and playing in a lot of giant tournaments where he did well. Obviously. But to be more specific, here are the tournaments where he got the most points:


**Pro Tour *Gatecrash* in Montreal 2013**: 516 points   
**Pro Tour *Dark Ascension* in Honolulu 2012**: 480 points   
**World Championship 2010**: 480 points   
**World Championship 2008**: 468 points   
**World Championship 2011**: 468 points


Congratulations, Gerry!
