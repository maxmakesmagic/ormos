There was a time when Urza was the most important unseen figure in **Magic**. He had [Urza's Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Urza%2527s%2BTower), [Urza's Miter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Urza%2527s%2BMiter), and [Sunglasses of Urza](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sunglasses%2Bof%2BUrza). But no one knew what he looked like.


Eventually, of course, he made an appearance on a card: [Mind Over Matter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Over+Matter), from *Exodus*.

The next block was *Urza's Saga*, so it's no surprise that Urza's appearances ramped up a bit. Since then, he's appeared on many cards. Sometimes he's been [Blind Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Blind%2BSeer), and one time he was a [Legacy Weapon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Legacy%2BWeapon). Since his story spans thousands of years, it's not surprising that he sometimes looks a little different. Here's some of our favorite Urza cameos.
