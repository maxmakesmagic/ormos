Here's an interesting tidbit that we get several emails about every month.


*Starter* (the doomed heir to *Portal*) was released in July of 1999, and the *Mercadian Masques* expert-level expansion was released in October of that same year. Both contained the card [Squall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squall), but each had a different mana cost. The *Starter* version cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif), and the *Masques* one was ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif).


How did that happen? Unclear. There's a note in the *Masques* file from the head of R&D telling the developers to synch the *Masques* [Squall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squall) up with the *Starter* version, but apparently someone changed one of them at the last minute.


As with other mana cost discrepancies (such as the [Alpha/Beta Orcish Artillery and Oriflamme](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/38)), the [Oracle](http://archive.wizards.com/dci/main.asp?x=oracle) is the final arbiter, and that document sides with the [Masques](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masques+) cost, meaning that Starter Squalls are tournament legal, but they must be played as if they cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif). The later appearance of the card in *Seventh Edition* further cements the ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) cost as correct.
