Well, sure, I guess we could do that. We could do that ... right *now!*


> Color: Blue spell
> 
> 
> Action: A human or elf nature mage has just had his/her spell foiled, and the spell's remnants have exploded like a paint bomb. The nature mage stands in front of a rock face, bracing from the blasted-apart spell, and the "spell-stuff" is splashed all over the mage and the rock face behind him/her. The splashed stuff gives the impression of a radial splatter painting, and the splatter, through some kind of strange magic, forms a rough, partial landscape "painting" from the spashes of spell goo.

After a few tweaks, that sketch ended up as this final piece of art.
