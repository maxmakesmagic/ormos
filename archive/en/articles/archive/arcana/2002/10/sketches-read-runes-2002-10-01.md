This week's "Sketches" focuses on a powerful blue instant from Onslaught, [Read the Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Runes) by Alan Pollack.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Location: Aphetto  
 Action: Wizard in the foreground, his hands are glowing magically. The land around him is covered in blue glowing magical runes. He is drawing the runes out of the land."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Alan. The card was originally known as "Decipher." Alan drew a Cleric instead of a Wizard, and was instructed to make sure the final image contained a Wizard.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. The change from sketch to painting is shocking with Alan's art; it almost looks like they were done by two different people.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as it appears in the set.
