Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






W*orldwake* is filled with fun and exciting new cards for Standard. Today, I would like to take a look at Standard Esper. I have wanted to play a non-combo deck with [Open the Vaults](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Open+the+Vaults) ever since it was first printed in ***Magic** 2010*. The spell seems incredibly strong. One can play a creature based version of Esper and make aggressive trades throughout the early and middle stages of the game. Once an opponent has managed to deal with all the relevant threats, you can cast your version of [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum). A late-game [Open the Vaults](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Open+the+Vaults) is very difficult to beat.

This type of strategy intrigued me when testing decks for Nationals last summer. Unfortunately, the Five-Color Control decks of that era were too powerful, and I found myself losing games even after I haymakered them with an [Open the Vaults](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Open+the+Vaults). I was also having a lot of trouble with Faeries and Elf combo. Today, Standard is a format defined by [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf). Powerful control decks, aggro-control decks, and combo decks are not what they were six months ago.

Even Jund posed a problem for the deck, though. *Worldwake*, however, gives us a new tool for our Esper Aggro deck. [Lodestone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) is the realest of deals. I was first introduced to the card while playing some games of Vintage at a friend's house. My friend, Ashok, cast a turn-one [Lodestone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) and rode it to victory in a format where turn-two kills are often too fragile and must be mulliganed in some matchups.

![Lodestone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lodestone+Golem)  
[Lodestone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) seemed like an excellent tool. It makes cascade spells significantly worse (because they have to pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) to cast the spell they cascade into), it slows down my opponent's bombs, and it's a four-mana creature that attacks for a quarter of my opponent's life total. It becomes [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)â€“resistant when I have a [Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium), [Ethersworn Shieldmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Shieldmage), or [Master Transmuter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter).

I started brewing up a list and went through all the cards I thought I would play with.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab77_theCardsHeader.jpg)  
**[Esper Stormblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Stormblade):** Creatures don't get much better than 3/2 flyers for two mana. I'm happy to finally find a place for this in the world of Standard. [Esper Stormblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Stormblade) is great for attacking planeswalkers or just Bolting your opponent's life total every turn.

**[Vedalken Outlander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Outlander):** Protection from red is a valuable ability. Having a creature that stops [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) in its tracks and cannot be [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)ed seems like a great deal to me.

**[Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium):** Not playing four of this card would be a crime. [Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium) will be very large here. The bonus it gives to the rest of our team only makes it more deadly.

**[Ethersworn Shieldmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Shieldmage):** This is a nice piece of tech. If you played a lot of *Shards of Alara* block Limited, you are probably very familiar with the blowouts that this card can induce.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab77_theCardsCross1.jpg)  
**[Lodestone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem):** I've been to more than a few Bar and Bat Mitzvahs in my day, and I never heard anything about this guy. I consider this card to be exceptionally powerful and wouldn't be surprised if it became a tournament staple in many different formats.

**[Sphinx Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner):** I've always loved fetching up a [Master Transmuter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) or [Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium) in times of need. It's also important to note that you can search up extra copies of [Sphinx Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner) and chump-block with them to set up a back-breaking [Open the Vaults](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Open+the+Vaults).

**[Master Transmuter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter):** I only included a single copy because the four-slot is already being clogged up by my new best friend, [Lodestone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem). I guess you could say that [Master Transmuter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) and I have been on the outs since [Thousand-Year Elixir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thousand-Year+Elixir) rotated out of Standard. I still feel comfortable playing a single copy of the lovely Artificer, though. There really isn't anything better to search for with a [Sphinx Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner). 

**[Thopter Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Foundry):** The synergy here was too great to not include a copy of this card. The ability to chump-block and make tokens or simply set up an alpha strike with [Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium) seems like it has far too much value.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab77_theCardsCross2.jpg)  
**[Tidehollow Sculler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler):** The best [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) I've ever seen. [Tidehollow Sculler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler) is a powerful card, and it deserves a home as much as cards like [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech).

**[Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade):** A lot of you have sent me frustrated emails explaining your lack of [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile). If you have the [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile)s you can make the swap and cut one [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) for a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). If not, [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) is a fine substitute.

**Borderposts:** Borderposts were made for a deck like this. They fix our mana, they pump our [Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium), they pump our [Esper Stormblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Stormblade)s, and they can be sacrificed to our [Thopter Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Foundry).

**[Open the Vaults](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Open+the+Vaults):** This is our [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum). It's very hard to lose a game of attrition when you can simply put every resource you've spent thus far in the game back onto the battlefield immediately.

The sideboard has six answers to [Great Sable Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Sable+Stag), a creature that can ruin your day with ease. The four [Hindering Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hindering+Light) are excellent answers to decks that pack cards like [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum). I like bringing in the [Hindering Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hindering+Light)s alongside the [Ethersworn Shieldmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Shieldmage)s. I can pass the turn leaving mana open for [Hindering Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hindering+Light) and still get value out of my mana by playing the [Ethersworn Shieldmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Shieldmage) on their end step if they don't cast anything relevant.

I decided to play some games at my local shop to test the deck against a random field.

I was very impressed with the Esper aggro deck. I had some very lucky draws and my opponents were in some unfortunate spots, but I feel [Lodestone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) is certainly worth considering as we continue to explore the new Standard environment. I hope you all enjoyed this new piece technology. The deck can also improve a bit if you have [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit)s and some [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile)s. I've been getting tons of emails about new decks with *Worldwake* cards, and I only hope I recieve more. I love getting emails about fun new decks.

Happy brewing!
