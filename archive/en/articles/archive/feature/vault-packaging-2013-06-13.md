![From the Vault: Twenty](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1171_logo_h7wy6g7fip.jpg)Back in February [we announced](/en/node/648356) this year's *From the Vault: Twenty*. Since we're just two months away from its release on August 23, 2013, it's time you get to see what the box looks like.


We aren't showing you what's inside, but that's coming soon! We might possibly have something special lined up for our panels at San Diego Comic Con and PAX Australia (keep an eye out for more info about what's going at each of these conventions).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1254_box_a90sud09a.jpg)What's inside this box? Well, In case you don't remember, here's what is inside this year's *From the Vault: Twenty*:


* **Twenty** premium foil cards, including some with new art.
* An exclusive Spindown life counter.
* A collector's guide.
* Each card has been printed using a foil process unique to the From the Vault series.
* The twenty cards are all printed in the current card frame. For some, it is for the first time.
* *From the Vault: Twenty* will be available worldwide in English only, and will have an extremely limited print run.
* All cards are black bordered and tournament legal. This means that these cards are legal for use in any tournaments where the original printings are still legal.
