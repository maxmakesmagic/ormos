If there's one thing players love to share, it's a bad beat story. Here are some of this weekend's most shocking cases of victory souring into defeat.

### Final Fantasy

![Final Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Final+Fortune)Gary Wise was playing against Tony Rungee who seemed to be playing some sort of [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) variant. He had a [Myr Incubator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Incubator) in play and six mana available and had the option of [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ing for [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) then activating on his opponent's turn, activating immediately, or [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ing for [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) to lock his opponent up (but also giving him an extra turn). In the end he thought to himself, "What could he possibly do anyway?" and went for the [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus). His opponent then proceeded to [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for [Final Fortune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Fortune) on end step, play an [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) imprinting the [Final Fortune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Fortune), and then [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) for [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel). Infinite turns, anyone?### Playing First Isn't Always Enough

Neil Reeves was playing first with his Oath deck against Kazushi Kawamura's seemingly typical Goblins and pulled up the god hand of [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), two [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)/[Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice), [Oath of Druids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids), and Isochron Scepter. On his first turn he played out a land, imprinted the Mox, and cast a Scepter with [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)/[Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice). He lost this game. 

How? Kawamura's first turn was [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), [Goblin Recruiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Recruiter), [Skirk Prospector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Prospector), sac both goblins, [Goblin Charbelcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher). Neil had one chance to draw one of his three outs, didn't, and immediately lost when his opponent had a second [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) to pay the activation cost despite being hit by [Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice).

### Turn Two [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) Isn't Either

Against Osamu Fujita, Kai Budde had a perfect [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) hand that resulted in [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) and [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) in play on turn one. He had the [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) in his hand and enough artifacts to be able to fetch and activate a [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) on his second turn. No matter. Osamu played a [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) and [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed it away for a [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus), then [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle)d it twice to allow a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), which gave him enough cards and mana for a second [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), this time for eight. With [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) available to be cast for free, Kai had no choice but to scoop before even untapping for a second turn.

### Eighteen on Turn One

![Twiddle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Twiddle)Osamu Fujita, playing Twiddle Desire, had an amazing first turn where he played [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), then [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), then [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) into [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus), followed by a [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) and [Diminishing Returns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminishing+Returns). Eventually he was in a position to cast [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony), but only eight spells had been cast in the turn. So he cast it for eighteen, setting the life totals at thirty-eight to two.The game wound on, with his opponent eventually casting a [Crumbling Sanctuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Sanctuary). A few turns later a [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) was resolved and activated, seeing a hand with a number of [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) effects. The opponent started tapping the [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) for mana, then Twiddling it and tapping it again, as the best way to use up all the [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle)s. The net result of all this? Fujita's only other Tendrils was milled into the graveyard, and he was forced to concede the game.

### Raw Dogging the Belcher

Osyp Lebedowicz was playing against a Goblin deck and had just sacrificed a [Myr Incubator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Incubator) for over twenty 1/1s. His opponent had no outs except for randomly activating his [Goblin Charbelcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher) and hoping, since he hadn't stacked his deck in any way. Spell after spell flipped off the top of the deck, and the net result was that Osyp took a full twenty-two damage and lost the game. What a beating.
