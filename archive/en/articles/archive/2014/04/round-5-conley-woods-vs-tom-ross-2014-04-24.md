 The players barely had time to enjoy their three byes as action started here in Atlanta. Fresh off a fourth round win each, round five saw friends Tom "the boss" Ross and brewmaster Conley Woods square off for a shot at day two and the continuing hunt for Pro Points.  
  

 "Tom and I had this thing where if one of us made top 8 the other would too, but then Tom stopped playing, and I started doing worse, but for a while we had a good thing going," Woods explained as the two shook hands before the match.






*Aggro deck aficionado Tom "the Boss" Ross*

  

 Regarding their decks, Conley Woods had tweeted his Green/Black build as "Nothing too flashy but a solid curve and a [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid)". Tom Ross was on Blue/Green, with multiple [Sudden Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm)s and a [Mistcutter Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistcutter+Hydra) as his rare all-star.   
  

 As the match fired off, it turned out it would be Conley's Caryatid who gave him the upper hand. In the first game he curved [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) into [Cavern Lampad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+Lampad) and bestowed it with [Spirespine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirespine) for what looked like a clock almost as quick as the pace of the super fast turns the players were taking.  
  

 Ross had to 2-for-1 himself with [Time to Feed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+to+Feed) on his [Chorus of the Tides](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chorus+of+the+Tides) to get rid of the lethal Cavern Lampard. But when Conley followed up with [Vulpine Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulpine+Goliath) and [Heroes' Bane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroes%27+Bane) the game was quickly over in favor of the Caryatid-powered army.  
  

 Tom Ross started off game two with a mulligan and Conley Woods, fresh from a 33rd finish at the Pro Tour last weekend once again had his trademark [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid). Ross got his hopes up when Conley didn't have a turn three play, but seeing as Ross's hand was all [Sudden Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm)s, [Aspect of Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Hydra), [Triton Tactics](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Tactics) and no creature but a turn five [Prescient Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prescient+Chimera), he wasn't out of the woods quite yet.






*Brewmaster Conley Woods*

  

 On Woods's side of the table big beasts came in the form of [Ravenous Leucrocota](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Leucrocota), [Vulpine Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulpine+Goliath) and an [Eater of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eater+of+Hope)s. "I just keep putting down larger and larger things," he exclaimed, unable to hold off a laugh at his heavy curve.




 Ross did have a [Sudden Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm) to lock down Woods offense for a turn, while summoning a [Setessan Oathsworn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Oathsworn) to get a race going. But when Woods added a [Sedge Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedge+Scorpion) and gained six life from a [Nylea's Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple) things were looking grim for the Louisianan.  
  

 Woods added a [Baleful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Eidolon), beefed it up with the all too familiar [Spirespine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirespine) and not even a second [Sudden Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm) from Ross could keep him alive for a turn when Woods finished the job with an [Aspect of Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Hydra).  
  

 In the end, it turned out that Woods mana accelerant [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) allowed him to get ahead in both games, and he does indeed hold it as the best card in his deck.




 "Outside of a bomb rare it's the card I most want in my deck. I have that and a [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr), but without those my deck would be pretty bad, " he explained after the match.  
  

 "I actually peeled the Caryatid of the top, so I got a little lucky keeping a slow hand," he admitted before wishing his friend Tom Ross the best of luck for the rest of the weekend. Both players are looking to score a few Pro Points to continue their quest for Silver and Gold level Pro Status.  
  
**Ross 0 â€“ Woods 2**
