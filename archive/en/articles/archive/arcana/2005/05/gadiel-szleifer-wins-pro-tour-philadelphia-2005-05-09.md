 After a season and a half without an American winner on the Pro Tour, Gadiel Szleifer has etched his name into **Magic** history by winning [Pro Tour-Philadelphia](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptphi05).
 



 Playing a deck leveraging the powers of [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven), the 16-year-old Illinois native defeated fellow teenager Kenji Tsumura of Japan three games to two [in the finals](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/finals-kenji-tsumura-vs-gadiel-szleifer-10000-gifts-given-and-title). Tsumura had a 2-1 lead going into the fourth game, but Szleifer fought off elimination to win his first Pro Tour.
 



 For his efforts this weekend, Szleifer won $21,275 in prize money. But perhaps more importantly, his victory elevated him to Level 5 status in the new [Pro Players Club](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/welcome-pro-players-club-2005-05-02). That means for the rest of this year and all of next season, he'll earn $1,500 for every Pro Tour he attends -- as well as having Wizards pick up his airfare costs for all of those trips.
 


Not a bad birthday present for Gadiel, who turned 16 and picked up his driver's license a mere week ago.


Congratulations, Gadiel!
