Boy, these *Eventide* token cards are pretty cool, huh? Wait, what do you mean you haven't seen them? Well, surely we can fix that. In fact, let's do that right now!


![Goblin Soldier Token](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1630_1.jpg)This happy little fellow is a ferocious Goblin Soldier. It appears that he has two weapons: an enormous scythe and a tiny dagger. Sensibly, he's using the scythe.


![Worm Token](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1630_2.jpg)Ah, a worm. Not a wurm or a wyrm, but a worm. It's very maggotty. And see how it glistens? That means it's healthy. What's next?


![Elemental Token](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1630_3.jpg)Whaâ€” what *is* that? That thing looks like bad news. You probably don't want one of those coming at you.


![Spirit Token](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1630_4.jpg)Spirits sometimes appear somewhat abstract to those of us in the material world.


![Beast Token](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1630_5.jpg)This image of a Beast seems to be from the point of view of someone being eaten by it. It was very considerate of the victim to ignore the agonizing pain of being digested long enough to paint this.


![Bird Token](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1630_6.jpg)This 1/1 bird token seems fairly straightforward. It's a bird, it's flying, basically it does what it says in the advertisements.


We have one token left, and to create some sense of mystery, we're hiding it.
