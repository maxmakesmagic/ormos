It's time for our weekly look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. We are in a quiet period as far as Grand Prix go, with no events scheduled until next month. That doesn't mean a quiet period for *Magic*, however!


Last weekend saw the final round of World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers, and several notable names were victorious on home turf. In Canada, No. 18 Alexander Hayne used all his skill and experience to join an excellent squad that will be led by our No. 8 ranked player Shaun McLaren, the [Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptbng14) winner. Matej Zatlkaj is no stranger to the Top 25 Rankings list, and he brought himself a step closer to rejoining the elite with a win in the final Slovak Republic Qualifier. He joins No. 5 Ivan Floch, who so memorably won [Pro Tour *Magic 2015*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptm15). Finally, there was an outstanding Top 8 at the American WMCQ, where Neal Oliver—winner of the largest *Magic* tournament ever, [Grand Prix Las Vegas 2013](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpveg13/welcome)—kept his cool to claim the final spot alongside team captain, and our No. 2 ranked player, Owen Turtenwald.


With the WMCQ season now behind us, it's full steam ahead for *Khans of Tarkir*. The Prerelease is just a few days away, and it's striking to note how many of our Top 25 are already testing for the Pro Tour that will be the undoubted highlight of this first part of our 2014–2015 season. So, enjoy the Prerelease, and join us right here next week for another look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
