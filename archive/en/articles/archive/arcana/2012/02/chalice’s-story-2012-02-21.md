Flip cards offer some fun possibilities for art and art interplay to be seen, let's take for example the [Chalice of Life](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+Life) and the [Chalice of Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+Death). Appearing back to back the art had to be clearly related but to avoid confusion for players they needed to make it visible at a glance which side was up.

The [Chalice of Life](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+Life) shows an angel apparently in that moment before it slays a demon. In the [Chalice of Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+Death) a demon is about to feast on that same angel!
