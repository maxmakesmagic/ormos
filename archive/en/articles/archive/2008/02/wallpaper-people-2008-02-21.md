So you say you've got some suggestions for our [Wallpaper of the Week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/wpotwarchive)? There are images you really wish we'd do? You want widescreen? You want wallpapers to be triangular instead of rectangular? (You do? *Really?*) We want to know.


We're most interested in art from older expansions that you'd like to see as wallpapers, because we're planning on doing a month or so of older art later this year. So head over to [the thread](http://forums.gleemax.com/showthread.php?t=994053) and mention anything you like or don't like about the wallpapers. But also mention a wallpaper or two that you'd really like to see. Once we have enough suggestions, we'll cull them down a little and run a poll so people can vote for which wallpapers they most want to see.
