Round 13 featured Yifan Wei, with a recent Top 8 at GP Melbourne this March, up against James Zhang, who won two GPs back to back in Melbourne and Sydney in 2005 and 2006. Before they began, we caught up with Zhang to discuss his GW/b deck.



 "It's not your usual Green/White deck," Zhang admitted, "I'm missing the usual top end, but I have a couple of bombs, including [Soul of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Zendikar), Yisan, Wanderer Bard and [Resolute Archangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Resolute+Archangel), and a bomb is a bomb. I've good one, two and three-drops for Ysian, and I'm splashing black for removal. I think I'll have to close out the game before any opposing Souls arrive."




**Game 1**




 Yifan played first, rushing out a [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern) that could sail right over Zhang's [Wall of Mulch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Mulch). Zhang followed up with an [Invasive Species](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invasive+Species), followed by a Wartorn Golem. Wei put down blockers and a second [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern). Facing the double flyers, Zhang thought things through before playing out [Yisan, the Wanderer Bard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yisan%2C+the+Wanderer+Bard). The Terns took Zhang down to 6. The next turn Zhang sent in his team. Wei tried some profitable blocks, but Zhang used Yisan to fetch out [Sunblade Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunblade+Elf) and pumped his team to survive. Wei swung back with the Terns, then finished Zhang off with a [Covenant of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covenant+of+Blood).






*James Zhang has the look of a man who just crossed out his life total.*
