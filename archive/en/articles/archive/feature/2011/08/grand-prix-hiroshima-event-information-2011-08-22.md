Hiroshima has long been an industrial center of Japan, and today is home to the headquarters of Mazda Motors. The city is also known for its okonomiyaki dishes as well as its proximity to Itsukushima Shrine, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and renowned from antiquity as one of the Japan's "Three Legendary Vistas." 


This will be the fourth Grand Prix to be held in the city, which is also the hometown of two of Japan's most famous ****Magic**** players, Masashi Ooiso and Kenji Tsumura.


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#1).*

**Tournament Structure** 


* Grand Prix Hiroshima will be run over two days using modified Swiss-style rounds of 50 minutes each. The number of rounds on Day 1 will be determined based on the number of players registered. Players will be paired randomly against players with similar win-loss records, with match points accumulating throughout the event.
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.

**Judges**


 The head judge for Grand Prix Hiroshima will be Kenji Suzuki (Level 3/Regional Coordinator, Japan). 


**Notes**
  


* The **Magic: The Gathering**  Tournament Rules and the **Magic: The Gathering**  Infraction Procedure Guide are in effect for this event unless specifically overruled by information in this Format Document.

 A player who has a bye in a round does not have to play a match in that round, but is treated as having won. A bye is normally given out to a player when there are an odd number of players in a round, but byes may also be rewarded to players for previous performance at a tournament or as a prize at a Trial tournament. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria *(Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players that accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds)*:

* Players with a [Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) level of 4 or higher

* Winners of Grand Prix Hiroshima Trial tournaments.

**Second-Round Byes** 
  


* Players with a [Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) level of 2 or 3
* Players with a DCI Total rating of 1950 or higher. Byes are based on DCI Total ratings published on October 26, 2011.

### Artist Information


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gphir11/igorkieryluk.jpg)**Igor Kieryluk**
  
 Originally planning to become a career diplomat, Igor Kieryluk majored in Foreign Affairs. Naturally, he ended up as a full-time freelancer artist. Although he came to the game late, after getting a gig with Wizards of the Coast his career blossomed and he now works for a host of different employers, including DC Comics and WHV, as well as participating in several graphic novel projects. His work has also been featured in the industry standard *Spectrum*. Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, he can avoid leaving his dark lair and exposing himself to the burning rays of the sun, instead toiling endless in the musty darkness of his mansion, lit only by the dim glow of the monitor, endlessly spewing into existence new twisted beings that would make Dr. Frankenstein proud (while also paying the bills).
