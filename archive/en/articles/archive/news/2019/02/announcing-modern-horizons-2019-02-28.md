"*What if*," the whispers went, "*What if they made a set that skipped Standard and went straight to Modern? Think of the things they could print!"*


Think about it we did. And we came up with some wild, exciting stuff.

Announcing *Modern Horizons*, the first set designed to skip Standard legality and aim straight for Modern.

Releasing June 14, *Modern Horizons* contains 249 new-to-Modern cards (254 total), with a mix of reprints not yet legal in Modern, and new cards that celebrate both Modern and *Magic*'s rich history. *Modern Horizons* will release on *Magic Online* June 13.


*Modern Horizons* boosters on *Magic Online* will be priced at $6.99.


But why wait that long? *Modern Horizons* is going to have Prerelease events at [local game stores](http://locator.wizards.com/) June 8â€“9!


This can all be a bit difficult to parse without some examples, so let's show you just a taste of what *Modern Horizons* has in store:

Powerful new options mixed with flavorful updates for favorite characters means *Modern Horizons* is going to be a wild ride. The set is full of cards that build up favorite Modern strategies, create new ones, and bring plenty of flavor to matches where Modern cards are legal.


Previews start at the end of May, so hold on tight. Change is on the horizon.
