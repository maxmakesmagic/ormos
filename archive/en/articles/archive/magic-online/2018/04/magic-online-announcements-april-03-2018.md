Modern Cube begins tomorrow
---------------------------



Modern has spent more time in the spotlight than usual lately, and the Modern Cube is a great way to try out all the iconic cards and synergies that shape one of Magic's most dynamic formats. Modern Cube can be found in the Limited Leagues section of the Play Lobby and will run through April 20.


For event details, and to see the complete card list and the latest changes to it, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/april-2018-modern-cube-event-and-cardlist-2018-03-27). Happy Cubing!



Brawl Coming April 18
---------------------


The new *Magic* format, Brawl, is coming to *Magic Online* on Wednesday, April 18! Keep an eye out for Lee Sharpe’s article on April 11 for more information about the *Magic Online* release.


In the meantime, read about the new format in Gavin Verhey’s article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ways-play/join-brawl-2018-03-22).


 
More Team Modern Super League
-----------------------------


If you haven't already been watching Team Modern Super League, you're missing out on a lot of fun and a lot of great *Magic* play. But you're in luck—the Modern action continues for a few more weeks, so you've still got plenty of chances to catch up!


TMSL airs Tuesdays (like this one!) at 5 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about Team Modern Super League [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/tmsl-info/), or check out the video below.
