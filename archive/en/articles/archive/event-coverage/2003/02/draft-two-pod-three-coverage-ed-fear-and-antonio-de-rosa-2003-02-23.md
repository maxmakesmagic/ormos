Ed Fear, the owner of a gaming store in Rochester, New York is drafting in pod three, being fed by Florida student Antonio De Rosa. Ed’s primary goal is to qualify for Pro Tour Yokohama and accumulate a few more points to help him get back on the train. A Top 8 wouldn’t make him too sad, either. His previous finishes include a boatload of Top 16’s, but he has yet to play during a Pro Tour day three. Antonio, being on the gravy train, is looking for nothing less than Top 8. De Rosa is a popular gravy trainer who tries to enjoy he game, though his competitive spirit shows in his consistently high finishes.

### Pack One

![Skirk Commando](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Skirk+Commando)Antonio opened his pack and had an easy choice: Silvos or [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock). He chose the big bad green monster with a big grin on his face. His second pick was a [Skirk Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando) over a [Gustcloak Harrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier), avoiding a weak color combination while taking the superior card. The third pick was the first one that offered any challenge. Faced with the option of [Elvish Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior) over [Spitting Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Gourna), Antonio took the elf. He explained later that he wanted the faster creature and Legions would fill out the beast quota anyhow. A late [Wirewood Savage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Savage) was chosen over a [Battering Craghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battering+Craghorn) and two great black cards. The rest of the pack offered a few borderline cards to go with a [Battering Craghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battering+Craghorn) that he was able to take.Ed’s choices were much more difficult. His first choice was a [Swat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat) over a [Barkhide Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler). His second pick was the [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) out of Antonio’s first pack. Suddenly going red behind a red drafter, Ed had to make a switch. He started taking soldiers, including a [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) and two [Gustcloak Harrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier)s. A late [Piety Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piety+Charm) was a good signal that white would be around for pack three. 

### Pack Two

![Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shock)Now that Ed was feeding Antonio, he had a much better shot at red cards. Hs first pick was [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock), over [Daru Lancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Lancer). He chose [Erratic Explosion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion) over [Dive Bomber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) and [Skirk Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando) second. [Embermage Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermage+Goblin) over [Erratic Explosion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion) was third. The rest of the pack was unexciting, providing only a second [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker), some mediocre fliers, and an [Akroma's Blessing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Blessing). The only thing worth noting was that the [Daru Lancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Lancer) made a lap around the table for Ed to take ninth.Now that Antonio was downwind of Ed, he was forced to focus on green creatures over red spells. A [Snarling Undorak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snarling+Undorak) was taken over some high quality white cards. [Elvish Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Vanguard) was taken second. The rest of the pack was weak, providing only some vanilla creatures and a [Skirk Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando).

### Pack Three

![Goblin Goon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Goon)Back in the position of feeding Ed and getting red cards, Antonio opened a monster pack. It contained [Goblin Goon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Goon), [Skirk Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Marauder), [Goblin Clearcutter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Clearcutter), and [Gempalm Strider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Strider). After much deliberation, Antonio took the Goon. His second pick was a bland [Patron of the Wild](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Wild). A third pick [Krosan Vorine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Vorine) was nice, but nowhere near as great as the fifth pick Timberwatch Elves, which was the one card Antonio was hoping to see over any other. The rest of the pack provided nothing more than a second [Patron of the Wild](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Wild).Ed fared fairly well. The pack he opened, though, forced him to ship [Havoc Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Havoc+Demon) to take [Flamewave Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamewave+Invoker). The second pick [Skirk Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Marauder) was given a place in Ed’s deck, and [Aven Redeemer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Redeemer) fit in as well. Ed managed to flesh out his deck with some [Gempalm Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Avenger)s and an Aven Warhark.

After the draft, Antonio was not optimistic about his chances of pulling the 3 – 0 he needed for Top 8. He believed that he drafted well, despite fighting over red with Fear. He ended up with a very fast red/green deck with a strong elf theme. 

Immediately after the draft, Ed was afraid he did not pick up enough playable cards for his deck. His choice to stick with red despite getting next to none in pack one paid off as he ended up with three absolutely fantastic red cards: two [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)s and a [Skirk Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Marauder). The [Frenetic Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenetic+Raptor) he snagged is a great asset against green decks, also. Ed believes that because he drafted a very fast deck, he has a very realistic possibility of pulling the 3 – 0 and making Top 8. “I passed a bunch of great cards, but the all cost five or six mana. By the time they go online, I should be winning the game anyway.”
