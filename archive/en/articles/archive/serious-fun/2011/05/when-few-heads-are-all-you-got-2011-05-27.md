If you didn't know it already, Tom LaPille is a stand-up guy. While I had only some brief interactions with him at US Nationals in 2010, it's his work at sharing the Development side of things every week in [Latest Developments](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?tag=Latest%20Developmentsamp;description=Latest%20Developments) that has made me a fan.

It was just the other week when I ran down [a concise directory of busting booster packs](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/143) to engage other players. What I didn't know was that Tom already had something Limited-related in the works for that week too, and introduced the world to [Winchester Draft](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/143).
