Grand Prix Melbourne champion Nam Sung Wook was looking for another Grand Prix victory this weekend. Playing this weekend's deck to beat--Abzan Aggro--he crushed opponent after opponent with Siege Rhinos and Anafenza, the Foremosts.


His opponent, Lin Yang, had to fight through quite the gauntlet to get to the top 8. After running the tables yesterday with a perfect 9-0 record, he woke up this morning and quietly crushed Makihito Mihara and Yuuya Wantanabe en route to his first Grand Prix top 8. He hoped to cast larger things than Nam Sung Wook with his Green Red Devotion Deck. With the ability to get a [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) into play early, he certainly had the tools to defeat the South Korean pro.


The Games
=========


Play for the quarterfinals began with a two-drop for both players: [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) for Lin and [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer) for Nam.


Lin followed things up with a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), but, when he attacked, Nam used [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) to deal with both of Lin's creatures.


Lin calmly cast a [See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten) on the following turn and found a [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen). While Nam didn't have an answer, Lin kept the heavy hitters coming with a [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka).

From there it was only a matter of time before Lin took the first game of the quarterfinals.


**Lin 1 - 0 Nam**


Nam had the first big play of the game in the form of a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) on turn 4. Lin's response? [Hornet Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Nest).

Nam used a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) to remove a [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) in Lin's hand, but Lin untapped and cast [See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten) which found a [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka). Nam had a [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance) prepared for the Dragonlord and untapped and cast an [Archfiend of Depravity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archfiend+of+Depravity).

This allowed Nam to get a foothold back into the game. It took a few turns for Lin to find an answer to the demon; all the while, Nam continued to bash away at Lin's life total 5 points at a time.


Finally, Lin found an answer to the Archfiend--Polukranos--but it was too Late, Nam found a [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) and sent the match to a deciding game 3.


**Lin 1 - 1 Nam**


Play for the third game also began slowly; Nam found a third turn [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost). Similar to the first game, when Lin double blocked with his [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) and Courser of Cruphix, Nam two-for-oned him with his [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command)

*Nam Sung Wook*


Nam kept the pressure up with a [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) on his fifth turn and dropped Lin to 4 life. When [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) took away Lin's [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) and the top of his deck netted him a land, Lin extended his hand.


**Nam Sung Wook wins 2-1 over Lin and advances to the Semifinals!**
