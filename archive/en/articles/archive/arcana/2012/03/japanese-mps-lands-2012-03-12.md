In Japan, Wizards distributes provides extra prize support for "**Magic** Premier Shops" that contribute to the game and the community above and beyond the level of a normal retail store. That means keeping a certain level of inventory on hand, running more than the usual number of in-store events, and periodically pulling in new players.

If this all seems somehow familiar, you either knew it already or you remember [this Arcana from three years ago](/en/articles/archive/japanese-mps-lands-2009-01-12), which showed the prize support that was being used at the time. Now, however, they're using these!
