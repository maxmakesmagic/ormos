Dragons, Liverpool, and Miami

While most writers here on DailyMTG are talking about *Dragons of Tarkir* previews, I'm thinking a little bit further into the future. Specifically, I'm thinking about the Pro Tour, which is just over five weeks away.



For the players who qualified, emails have already been sent in your direction about a little something not often talked about on the *Magic* front page. However, it's one of the key prizes for winning a Pro Tour Qualifier. We're going to look into what that is, and what goes into claiming that reward.



After that, we're going to take a look at a pair of upcoming Grand Prix this weekend.

The Pro Tour Approaches
=======================




Last weekend, the Pro Tour Qualifier season and the remaining two Grand Prix that qualified players for Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* took place. And with that, the final invitations to April's Pro Tour have been awarded.



To those of you who won an invitation to Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*, congratulations! We look forward to welcoming you to Brussels, Belgium, April 10-12! Whether you've won an invitation to the Pro Tour before, or if you're traveling to your first big event, there may be a few questions that you have, and we want to address those as soon as possible.



Oftentimes, winning an invitation to the Pro Tour comes with a travel award to help you get there as well. Let's get into what a travel award is.




What is a travel award?
=======================



A travel award is a prize that you will often receive alongside a Pro Tour invitation to help you get to the event and compete. We will take care of your airfare, but any additional expenses such as baggage fees and hotel accommodations are your responsibility.




Who gets a travel award?
========================



All Pro Tour Qualifier winners receive a travel award with their invitation to the Pro Tour. In addition, all players who finish in the Top 8 of a Grand Prix (or Top 4 of a Team format Grand Prix) as well as Gold-level and Platinum-level players in the Pro Tour Players Club are eligible to receive a travel award.



*Note: some players may earn an invitation to the Pro Tour that does not include a travel award. These methods include (but are not limited to): finishing with 39 match points at a Grand Prix (or 36 match points in a Team format Grand Prix) but not finishing in the Top 8, winning a Magic Online Pro Tour Qualifier Finals event, winning a Magic Online Championship Series event, being a Silver-level player in the Pro Tour Players Club, and being granted a special invitation.*




How do I claim my travel award?
===============================



In order to claim your travel award, you must first take care of the following:




**Complete all required documentation**



This includes your tax form ([W-9 for citizens and residents of the United States](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf), [W-8BEN for all non-US persons](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf)), as well as a consent and release agreement which you can download [here](http://media.wizards.com/2014/docs/OP_Consent_and_Release.pdf).



In addition, you'll need to provide a copy of identification that verifies your age, such as a driver's license, passport, government ID, or birth certificate.




**Send in all completed documentation**



You can send the required documents in via the following methods:



* Fax (+1-425-254-2924)
* [Scan and email your document to us](mailto:premierplay@wizards.com)
* Mail them in to the following address:


Wizards of the Coast  




Because these documents need to be received and verified before we can book your plane ticket, *it is very important that you send in this information right away*.




**What if I've already sent this stuff in before for a prior travel award?**



In general, it is recommended that you send in everything even if you've already sent these items in for a prior travel award to prevent any potential delays on booking your travel for the Pro Tour. Better safe than sorry!




**Okay, I did that. What's next?**



Approximately two weeks after you earn a travel award and invitation to the Pro Tour, we will contact you with travel booking instructions to the email address in your [Wizards Account](https://accounts.wizards.com/) profile.



If you are reading this and have *not* been contacted yet by Wizards of the Coast *and* you believe you have won a travel award, [please let us know immediately](mailto:premierplay@wizards.com)!



Once you have received an email from us, follow the instructions on contacting the travel agency at Hasbro to book your travel. Once you receive an itinerary from Hasbro Travel, you will have 24 hours to approve your itinerary or make changes. These travel bookings have to be finalized no later than 30 days before the first date of travel to the Pro Tour.



Keep in mind that any travel not issued or finalized prior to this date *will be forfeit*, so don't delay when you receive your instructions!




**I'm under 18 years of age! Do I still get a travel award?**



If you are under the age of 18 and win a travel award, you will receive a cash equivalent that is equal to a travel award. This award will be processed after the Pro Tour, and only if you return all documentation as noted above, attend the Pro Tour, and register to play.




**What if I need a visa to travel to the country in which a Pro Tour is taking place?**



It is your responsibility to determine if a travel visa is required for your r trip. Please note that it typically takes many weeks for visas to process, so don't delay if you are planning to go!




**What if I live in the area and don't need a plane ticket?**



If you live within reasonable driving distance you may be eligible for a Travel Equivalency Award. If you are interested in this option, please let us know when you receive your travel booking instructions via email.




Whether you've already booked your travel or have just finishing that up, we look forward to seeing all of last season's recipients of a Pro Tour invitation in Brussels in a few weeks! And if you haven't received anything and you are expecting an email, then *please*, [let us know](mailto:premierplay@wizards.com) soon!



And if you didn't earn an invitation to compete at Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*, keep your eyes open for opportunities to qualify for the Pro Tour. After all, more often than not, qualifying for the Pro Tour means more than competing on the main *Magic* stage. It's also often the chance to visit an exciting destination, with the flight costs covered by us.

In Grand Prix News…
===================



Narrowing our vision to what's coming up now, rather than what's coming in a few weeks, we've got another double Grand Prix weekend after a week off.




Liverpool
=========


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/daily/GP-City-Only-Liverpool-Black%202.png)



First up is [Grand Prix Liverpool](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-liverpool-2015), the first European Grand Prix run by tournament organizer [ChannelFireball](http://www.channelfireball.com/). At the time of me writing this, there are just over 150 seats left in the *Fate Reforged* /*Khans of Tarkir* Limited main event. If you've been procrastinating on preregistration, then there may even be a chance that you're too late to get your main event seat!



However, if it's *not* the case, then signing up for the main event guarantees you one of these bad boys:



![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/playmat_H0x5DySoM2.png)



That's right. Everyone who signs up for the Grand Prix Liverpool main event received an event-exclusive playmat featuring the art of green Limited staple [Whisperer of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperer+of+the+Wilds). On top of that, players will also receive this Grand Prix Griselbrand promo, and some ChannelFireball swag to boot.




Unable to make it? Don't worry. We'll be bringing you live video coverage of this event starting Saturday at 2 p.m. local time (GMT)/6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET. You'll be able to catch the live coverage on the [*Magic* Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic).




Miami
=====

While Liverpool competitors battle it out in Sealed Deck and Booster Draft, Standard fans will be traveling to [Grand Prix Miami](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-miami-2015) to show off what they've got. [StarCityGames](http://www.StarCityGames.com/) returns to Miami, home of beautiful beaches, Reid Duke championship titles, and [big moments in Grand Prix finals](http://youtu.be/IU8ipv6hKpg).



For players who are competing in the main event, this memorable Miami souvenir will await them…



![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/playmat_ifWgJbC2bY.png)



All players in the main event will receive an event-exclusive playmat featuring [Mardu Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Scout), Tarkir's very own sand surfer. All main event participants will receive some StarCityGames goodies and the foil Grand Prix Griselbrand promo as well!



If you're unable to make it to Miami, you can still be part of the action by tuning in to the live video coverage. You'll be able to catch the main event coverage on the [SCGLive Twitch page](http://www.twitch.tv/scglive) starting Saturday at 9:30 a.m. local time (ET)/6:30 a.m. PT/2:30 a.m. GMT. Text reporter Peter Rawlings and I will be there digging up cool decks and sharing sweet stories both days as well, so stay glued to the website for decks, features, and more!




That's all for this week. Enjoy the new set previews, and maybe I'll see a few of you in Miami this weekend!
