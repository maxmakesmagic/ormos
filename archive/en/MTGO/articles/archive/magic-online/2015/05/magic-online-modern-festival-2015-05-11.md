*Modern Masters 2015 Edition* is releasing soon! Playing in those drafts will enable you to collect some important Modern Constructed cards, so if you aren’t already playing Modern, it’s a great time to jump in the format. And if you’re already a Modern fan, it’s time for you to celebrate your favorite format.


*Magic Online* is having a [Modern Festival](#events)! Why should you be interested? How about one copy of every set legal in Modern? You can win it through the Modern Festival Finals! To qualify for this tournament, you’ll need to play in a [Modern Festival Prelim](#ModernPrelims). The events will be happening from 6/24-7/1, replacing the Modern Daily Events during that time. In these events, you can get a regular [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) promo just for participating, plus a foil if you qualify for the finals.

Well now you know how to qualify through the prelims, but what will the July 5 Sunday festival award you?




| Place | Prizes | QPs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | 1 copy of every [Modern-legal set](#modern-legal), 1 premium *Modern Masters* set, and 1 premium *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* set | 35 |
| 2nd | 1 premium *Modern Masters* set, and 1 premium *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* set | 15 |
| 3rd-4th | 1 regular *Modern Masters* set, and 1 regular *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* set | 15 |
| 5th-8th | 1 regular *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* set | 15 |
| 9th-16th | 12 *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* booster packs | 8 |
| 17th-32nd | 9 *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* booster packs | 5 |
| 33rd-64th | 6 *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* booster packs | 3 |

Yep, that’s right. One copy of every [Modern-legal](#modern-legal) set. And plenty of sets of *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* sets, plus *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* boosters as well. Like PTQs and MOCS Finals, the finals will receive [DEC support](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/meet-digital-event-coordinators-2014-06-04) to provide immediate help for players in the event experiencing an issue.


The [Magic Online Championship Series](http://magic.wizards.com/en/2015-magic-online-championship-series) Season 7 Finals take place on July 4 (with prelims July 1-3), all of which are Modern format. You can earn Qualifier Points for this Modern Season Finals between the May 27 downtime and the June 24 downtimes, which includes the period for *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* events.


This makes July 4-5 a big weekend for Modern players on *Magic Online*! First there’s the *Magic Online* Championship Series Finals on Saturday, July 4th, and then the Modern Festival Finals on Sunday, July 5th.


We’ll also be running a [Phantom Flashback Event](#Mirrodin) for the very first Modern-legal block, the original *Mirrodin*. Participants can also get a textless [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) promo just for participating, and a foil for winning.

The [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) promo can also be yours for playing some Modern, of course! From 6/24-7/8, the [Modern 5-3-2-2 queue](#Modern5322) will be giving the textless [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) promo to all participants, plus an additional foil copy to the winner.


Have fun with *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* and the Modern Festival, and good luck qualifying for both the July 4th and July 5th Modern events!
