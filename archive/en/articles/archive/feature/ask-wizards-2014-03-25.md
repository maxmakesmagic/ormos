**Q: How often does Friday Nights come out? How often does Walking the Planes come out? â€”Alessandro** 


Personally, I feel the answer is, "Not often enough." But that's not helpful (or official!), so here's an answer you can work with: We're looking to standardize the schedule for both, as they are currently a bit irregular, but that said...


In general, Friday Nights comes out about once a month.

Walking the Planes comes out two weeks after each event that Nathan Holt and Shawn Kornhauser attend. They go to all Pro Tours, Worlds Week, and a handful of Grand Prix each year.

I hope that helps!
