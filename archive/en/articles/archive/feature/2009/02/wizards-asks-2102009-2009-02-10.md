*What's your favorite combo, and why?*


![Alexis Janson](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_alexisjanson.jpg)**Alexis Janson:** My favorite combo is [Mana Geyser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Geyser) and an EDH game. Seriously, adding 22 mana to your mana pool tends to win games—last time I played [Mana Geyser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Geyser), I followed it up with [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) and [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) for N, followed by an attack for 3 \* N \* NumPlayers(). (I won that game.)


![Mana Geyser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mana+Geyser)  
My favorite combo that actually involves multiple cards is probably [Breath of Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breath+of+Fury) and [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker). You put [Breath of Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breath+of+Fury) on some creature with evasion, copy the creature with [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kiki-Jiki%252C%2BMirror%2BBreaker), and attack. Assuming you connect with your opponent, you sacrifice the creature, move [Breath of Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breath+of+Fury) to the token copy, untap the token and [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kiki-Jiki%252C%2BMirror%2BBreaker), make a new copy of the token, and attack again. Repeat this until your opponents are dead.

My favorite combos tend to be ones that can appear out of nowhere and defeat several opponents—an important factor when playing cutthroat multiplayer. I also like how it uses an obscure card. I won't play a bad card just to prove it can be played, but I love getting use out of "forgotten" or "neglected" cards.
