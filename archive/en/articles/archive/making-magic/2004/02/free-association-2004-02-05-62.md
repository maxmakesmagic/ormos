 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






This column has the highest word count of any column I've ever written (including the choose-your-own-adventure). But on average, this column will be normal length when read. At least, I believe it's supposed to. I don't write non-linear columns all that often.

But even non-linear columns have to eventually come to an end. And so it goes.

Thanks for hooking up with me for the bizarre journey.

Join me next week when I start getting extra-interactive.

Until then, may you read this column as many times as it takes.
