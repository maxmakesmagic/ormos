We're not ready to start previewing *Dark Ascension* cards yet. That'll start happening on Monday, January 9. However, we could probably be convinced to show you some of the art. That's not going to hurt anything, right? After all, you saw some in Monday's [feature article by Doug Beyer](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/176). So have some more!
