**What is your favorite spoiled card from *Battle for Zendikar,* and why?**


The *Battle for Zendikar* spoilers are in full spring, and *Magic’s* return to a treasured (if beleaguered) plane is fast approaching. I talked to a few of the players competing at Grand Prix Oklahoma City about what they’re most looking forward to when the battle for Zendikar begins.

“Ob Nixilis Reignited. Black lost [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) but Abzan it’s still going to be a strong choice, and Ob Nixilis is probably the best follow-up to [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino).”

“Gideon, Ally of Zendikar. I lost to [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) a lot with control decks. It’s nice to have a similar planeswalker who can also fit in control decks.

“From Beyond. [Awakening Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening+Zone) was a good card that people liked, and this one is just as good. From a design standpoint, I actually really like Kiora, Master of the Depths. I think it’s one of the best-designed planeswalkers in a while; it’s exactly what blue and green want to be doing.”

“It may not be the most exciting answer, but the full-art lands are gorgeous. It’s sweet that anyone can get them for their decks, and it’s really exciting to know you might be able to pull an Expedition.”
