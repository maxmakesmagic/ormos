Live Coverage of 2004 Grand Prix Columbus
=========================================












![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcol04/fin.jpg)**Mike Turian is the Grand Prix Columbus Champion!**


As his farewell tour nears its conclusion he put a crowd pleasing bow on the largest North American Grand Prix on record. Things started off on Saturday morning with 854 players queuing up for the $25,000 in prize money that was given away this weekend. There were so many players that the Day Two cut allowed 128 players through the velvet ropes.


After six rounds of draft--and fifteen rounds overall--the cut to Top 8 was a brutal one. Only one player with as many as three losses made it to the final table. Kate Stavola, Matt Larson, Craig Krempels, Brandon Rickard, Aaron Lipczynski, Cedric Phillips, and even Pro Tour Boston winner Brock Parker had to feel intimidated as they sat down to draft with the most well known member of CMU.

They would have been even more leery had they seen him open [Grab the Reins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins) and [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) --you couldn't ask for two better opens--and his red-white deck made short work of everyone in his path right up to and including his CMU/TOGIT teammate Craig Krempels in the finals.


One of the big stories this weekend was the breakout performance of Kate Stavola. She come into the tournament without the benefit of any byes and only lost one match all weekend until she met up with Mike Turian in the semi-finals. She was also an amateur and won an additional $1,500 for her impressive efforts.


With a few exceptions scattered about the globe this event marked the close of the Qualifier season for Pro Tour San Diego. Next up is Team Limited season for Pro Tour Seattle and the Grand Prix in Washington DC.


See you all there in April!
