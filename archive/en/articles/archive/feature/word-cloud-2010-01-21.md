Wanna see something cool?

...oh. You don't know what you're looking at, do you? Well, that's fair. This is a word cloud (made at [wordle.net](http://www.wordle.net)) showing the rules text of a single *Worldwake* card. We thought it would be a fun game to post this and let you dissect it to figure out what the card does! The bigger the word in the cloud, the more times it appears on the card.


And then we thought "Hey, some people don't like jumping through hoops to see card previews."
