Both Chye Yian Hsiang and Liu Yuchen swept their quarters and found themselves matched against each other in the semis. With the assurance of a Philippines player in the finals, it was up to either them if they desired a Malaysian or a Chinese Grand Prix Champion.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Topan+Freeblade)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shambling+Ghoul)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Ghoul)
From the looks of it, Liu's bunch of [Shambling Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Ghoul)s will fare poorly if they wereÂ unable to block the trio of Chye's [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade) on time.


In addition, [Enshrouding Mist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enshrouding+Mist) was a cheap foil to Liu's [Wild Instincts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Instincts), while [Celestial Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Flare) acted as trumps against [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth) and [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk).


Game 1
======


Chye curved out perfectly with [Anointer of Champions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointer+of+Champions), [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade) and [Knight of the Pilgrim's Road](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Pilgrim%27s+Road). Liu's start wasn't that bad but [Shambling Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Ghoul)'s drawback punished him significantly in the face of two creatures with renown.


Liu spent his fourth turn to kill [Iroas's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iroas%27s+Champion) with [Wild Instincts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Instincts), but took seven from the ensuing attack. Chye's next attack was lethal, with the help of [Enshrouding Mist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enshrouding+Mist) for "exactsies".

Game 2
======


Chye was forced to take a mulligan and Liu was able to quickly pressure Chye with [Shaman of the Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+the+Pack) and [Yeva's Forcemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yeva%27s+Forcemage). Chye goes down to 14 life.


[Lightning Javelin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Javelin) took care of the bigger Elf, so Liu replaced with [Rhox Maulers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+Maulers) and reduced Chye to 10 with two swings of [Yeva's Forcemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yeva%27s+Forcemage).


Despite having [Pia and Kiran Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pia+and+Kiran+Nalaar), that was no match for an angry Rhino. Using a second copy of [Wild Instincts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Instincts) to kill the Legendary creature, Liu was able to deal the killing blow with the help of [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth). That's 10 trampling damage in one fell swoop!

Game 3
======


Chye's spent his first few turns to summon [Sigil of Valor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+Valor), [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade) and [Iroas's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iroas%27s+Champion). Liu defended with [Shambling Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Ghoul) and a pair of Elvish Visionaries.


To break past the defenses, Chye recruited [Ghirapur Gearcrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghirapur+Gearcrafter) before equipping [Sigil of Valor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+Valor) to his double striker. Liu wisely chumped with an Elf to absorb 10 damage.

Eyeblight Assassin was used to kill a Thopter but Liu was in deep trouble. Unless he found a solution to [Iroas's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iroas%27s+Champion), he would be forced to chump every turn. Thankfully, [Shambling Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Ghoul) was able to survive the 6/6 Soldier after being boosted by [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth).


However, the game was pretty easy for Chye, who simply re-equipped [Sigil of Valor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+Valor) to another creature, recreating another 5/5. Liu double blocked, hoping to find [Conclave Naturalists](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conclave+Naturalists) to put an end to the madness.


When Liu blocked a 3/3 [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade) with [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) and sacrificed [Shambling Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Ghoul) to it, Chye blew him out of the water with [Celestial Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Flare).


Now that Liu had a completely empty board against a pair of renowned [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade), it was only a matter of time for Chye to seal the deal. He was still holding the [Enshrouding Mist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enshrouding+Mist) and [Chandra's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Fury) that would guarantee Liu's demise.
