 As players have turned in their decklists already, the morning gave us an opportunity to crunch the numbers and see what players brought to battle in the first weekend to highlight *Fate Reforged* in the Standard Constructed format. Take a look below!





| R/W Midrange | 8 |
| U/B Control | 8 |
| Abzan Aggro | 6 |
| Green Devotion | 4 |
| Abzan Midrange | 3 |
| Mardu Midrange | 3 |
| Jeskai | 2 |
| B/G Enchantments | 1 |
| G/U Manifest | 1 |
| Jeskai Ascendancy | 1 |
| Mardu Aggro | 1 |
| Dictate Naya | 1 |
| R/G Monsters | 1 |
| R/W Heroic | 1 |
| Sidisi-Soul | 1 |
| Sidisi-Whip | 1 |
| W/U Heroic | 1 |

The two most popular decks are not clans nor shards, but rather two-color combinations that have streamlined towards the best of two colors.



 The first deck to talk about on this list is Blue-Black Control, a deck that saw success at Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* but has routinely fallen off in the last few months, only to emerge when the format favors it. The archetype picked up a couple of key cards from *Fate Reforged*, notably [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate), a new sweeper from *Fate Reforged* for the archetype, as well as the powerful [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon).

 The other deck that is tied for the most popular today is R/W Midrange, and this deck comes in various mixtures of card combinations. The deck offers a lot of the power from the Jeskai decks of earlier Standard months, in favor of a more consistent mana base as well as powerhouse removal Chain to the Rocks. While some pass on new offerings from *Fate Reforged* in favor of these goodies, others play varying numbers of [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master), the potent new white mythic.



The one thing most of the R/W decks have in common, however, is with a full suite of one creature: [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon). The red dragon has always been a heavy hitter, but when the sweeper of choice for control decks is [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate), the dragon also threatens additional pressure on the board that [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate) is unable to sweep away completely.

Next up in popularity is the Standard staple Abzan Aggro, primarily fueled with the old cards with the occasional Warden of the Fist Trade tossed into the mix.


Next up is Green Devotion, which comes in three flavors today: a splash of red for [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) and/or [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws) (two), a splash of black for constellation goodness (one), and some sideboard options, and mono-green with a multitude of manifest options including both [Wildcall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildcall) and [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) (one).


After that, the field starts to diversify quickly, with a variety of options ranging from the commonly played to the wild and new. Players came with everything ranging from the traditional W/U Heroic to the G/U Manifest/Prophet of Kruphix/Nykthos fun!


One thing that many of the white decks all have in common, however, is the wide adoption of this notable new uncommon.

This card is doing work in just about every list sporting white mana, assuming no heavy [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) plan. Expect this combat trick and removal spell to populate Standard decks for a while.
