At Gen Con 2009, *From the Vault: Exiled* went on sale. As you can perhaps imagine, it was a hot ticket. People started lining up the day before. So because we didn't want people to be stuck in line all that time, we handed out tickets at 9:00 AM to the people in line so that they'd be able to come back later and get their product.


Except instead of tickets, we used, well, **Magic** cards. Specifically, *From the Vault: Dragons* cards that didn’t meet our quality control standards. Observe!

A close inspection will reveal that the cards all have addditional modifications on them. This is because we asked that the people in line draw on their cards to customize them even further. Then we collected them the next day, and now we're showing some of them to you. Roll it!
