Mmmm, numbers. Going into the day, there was some concern that the Standard format would be as boring as Block has become, but such was not the case. No fewer than 25 distinct archetypes saw play in Day 1. Looking at the results, Big Red is leading the results for decks that saw heavier play, followed by Goblins, [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail), and green-white Slide. The [Death Cloud](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) decks also fared well on the day, showing that the newest Pox may actually be underrepresented for its power in the current metagame.


The fear that Affinity would dominate this format like it has dominated Block have been assuaged, as "the most powerful mechanic ever created" only managed to post a substandard 8.72 Points average. That slightly below-average number was considerably better than the numbers posted by blue-white control and the blatantly awful blue-red [March of the Machines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines) deck. Kai and the TOGIT crew clearly chose poorly when picking a deck for Standard, a fact realized by many players of the deck as early as round 1.
