[Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) is close, but I like Asp a lot. And for uncommon, it might be [Thassa's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Emissary). At first it was something like [Sea God's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+God%27s+Revenge) or [Phalanx Leader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader), but I like the Emissary the best. It's splashable, it's really powerful, and it's blue."*

I think [Keepsake Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keepsake+Gorgon) is by far the best uncommon. And the common is probably [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp), and the Asp is so much bigger than any other common in the format."* 





![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsac14/qq_hayne.jpg)***No. 18 Ranked Player Alexander Hayne:** "[Voyage's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End) and [Sea God's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+God%27s+Revenge). At the beginning of the format I thought [Sea God's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+God%27s+Revenge) was really good, but I didn't realize how good [Voyage's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End) would be. I thought [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) was better, but that one is still really high up."* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsac14/qq_wrapter.jpg)***No. 2 Ranked Player Josh Utter-Leyton:** "For common, it's [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel). For uncommon, it's [Keepsake Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keepsake+Gorgon). Certainly if I'm opening Gray Merchants for my common, then that's the uncommon I'd want! And my preferences haven't really changed, though at the start of the Sealed format I might have wanted [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) more."*
