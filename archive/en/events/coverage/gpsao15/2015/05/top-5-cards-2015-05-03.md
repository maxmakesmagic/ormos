**Foul-Tongue Invocation**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Foul-Tongue+Invocation)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foul-Tongue+Invocation)


Playing casting black spells are practically spoiled with choice when it comes to assembling their removal suite. Between Hero's Downfall, Ultimate Price, Bile Blight, [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow) and Self-Inflicted Wound, there is no shortage of quality kill spells. However, our pick of the weekend would have to be Foul-Tongue Invocation. The ability to kill Dragonlord Ojutai, [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death) or even a monstrous [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) at instant speed is what sets it apart from all the others. In addition, the life boost granted often makes the difference between life and death. Gaining four life can buy you enough time to stabilize, or sometimes completely dash your opponent's hopes of winning.

**4. Deathmist Raptor**

Of all the green creatures in the format, close to none are as resilient or well-rounded as Deathmist Raptor. Aside from the fact that they trade with almost any opposing creature, they also rise from the grave (eventually!) and attack decently well. These generic properties are why [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) can find a home in so many decks. It is not unreasonable to find the pesky raptor in Abzan Megamorph, Sultai Whip, Bant Megamorph, Green White Aggro, Red Green Aggro and Green-based Devotion decks.

**3. Thunderbreak Regent**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thunderbreak+Regent)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent)


There are so many great dragons flying around Tarkir. Ojutai. Silumgar. Atarka. Just to name a few. But [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) is special. It's the most cheaply-costed of them all, and that makes it one of the best. Not only is it able to hit the board early, it even gives you value when it gets targeted by removal. If you manage to get a pair of them on the battlefield, your opponent is likely dead unless they manage to find a sweeper. Having four toughness means it survives against [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) and Bile Blight, coincidentally also excellently positioned against the rest of the field.

**2. Silumgar's Scorn**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Silumgar%27s+Scorn)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Scorn)


The rise and fall of control decks can be attributed to many reasons. Either the card drawing is as awesome as Sphinx's Revelation, or the board sweepers as great as Wrath of God. In our current Standard climate, however, it is the “reprinting” of [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) that makes the blue control decks tick. [Silumgar's Scorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Scorn) is important because it is a two-mana card that can be used to disrupt opponents on Turns 2 or 3, with or without a dragon. More often than not, you can catch something in the early game, given that there are so many Theros Scrylands and Khans of Tarkir Tri-lands among our mana bases. The ability to interact with the opponent on Turn 2 is crucial, something that Dissolve, [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) or [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) could never do. Yet in the late game, once you find one of your many dragons in your deck, it becomes an answer to anything your opponent can present. Such versatility is prized amongst blue mages, and it is also the reward for playing with the #1 card on our list this weekend.

**1. Dragonlord Ojutai**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dragonlord+Ojutai)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai)


[Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) has done it again. No rest. No mercy. No matter what. It has claimed yet another Grand Prix victory, two weeks ago in Alexander Hayne's hands, this week in Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa's. [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) was deemed so important that PV has decided to run the full set this weekend. Doesn't matter that it's a Legend. Once you successfully attack and receive a free “Anticipate” chances are, things are going to go downhill for your opponent. Perhaps, that has made all the difference for PV this weekend!
