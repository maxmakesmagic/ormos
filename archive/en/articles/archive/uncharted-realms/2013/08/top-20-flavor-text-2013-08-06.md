Flavor text is near and dear to my heart. I have been writing these little gems for close to a decade now and I am still amazed at how much fun, wisdom, intrigue, smackdown, and sass can be packed into a few, carefully chosen words.

If long-form writing is the awesome dinosaur that rules the literary wilderness, then these little snippets of flavor text are the hot-blooded mammals that are kicking ass in the shrubs.

While I'm on a roll here, flavor text is like the mortar that holds the story together. It's in the cracks between the other storytelling venues that we have, and it fills in—bit by bit—story information and planar flavor that you can't get anywhere else.

The metaphors for what flavor text is and does are endless.

There are many kinds that have garnered love over the ages:

Frog flavor text:

[Turn to Frog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220265)
*"Ribbit."*

Snappy one-liners:

*Catch!*

Updates to snappy one-liners:

Quasi-algebraic-looking flavor text:

[Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=96952)
*"(Z–gt;)90º—(E–N²W)90ºt = 1"*

And flavor text that just keeps coming back, over and over again:

[Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370812)
*For the first time in his life, Grakk felt a little warm and fuzzy inside.*

 In honor of 20th Anniversary Week, I decided to pull the most well-loved flavor text from the **Magic** Facebook page, where flavor fans were asked to submit their champions from the flavor arenas so that all may see and marvel. 

There were close to 3,000 submissions, and there were many, many awesome ones that didn't make the list, but here are the ones that showed up time and time again.

Here are the Top 20 from you flavor fans, in no particular order!

There are many thousands of flavor text gems that are near and dear to me that are not on this list, and I'll be thinking of the ones I "should have" put in here for weeks to come, but I guess that's the good news as well—there is a wealth of awesome flavor gems to make you laugh, smirk, chortle, wince, wonder, ponder, and smacktalk your friends with. I hope you have enjoyed this handful.

 Well, it's back to the flavor mines for me, but stay tuned, fellow Vorthosians! We're cooking up a bunch more future classics that are *en route* to a card store near you!
