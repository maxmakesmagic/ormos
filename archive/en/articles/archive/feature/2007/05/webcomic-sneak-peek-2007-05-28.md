Welcome to Theme Week Week! Mark Rosewater's out of the office for Memorial Day—along with everyone else—but I managed to sneak into the Monday update to give you a proper welcome. A more responsible writer will probably give you a detailed description of what this week's theme means, but I'll save my own commentary for Theme Week Week Week, in which we'll discuss Theme Week Week's theme in depth and review all of the Theme Week Week weeks, from the strong weeks to the weak weeks.

My chosen Theme Week Week week is Sneak Peek Week. (My first choice was *Lorwyn* Preview Week, but I was denied.) I am going to give you a sneak peak into a possible future in which I may be writing a theoretically regular webcomic for **magicthegathering.com**. In this potential future, Thom Beckman might be bringing my words to life with his illustrations. If you want to make this future a reality, please write voluminous praise in the forums. If you instead want the future that leads to the Cyborg Revolution of '09, you're a traitor to nonartifact Humans.

While our potential future webcomic will have a linear plot (excluding occasional diversions like "More Legends of the Future" below), this sneak preview instead contains separate comics written for different possible futures of **Magic**. You might recognize them. If you would like to start at the very beginning—a very good place to start—again, make your voice heard. It's all in my mind, waiting... plotting...
