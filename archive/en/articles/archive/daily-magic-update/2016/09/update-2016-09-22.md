The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 22, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [instant-speed tricks](#item1) and [updated decklists](#item10).


Today's Must
============


1. [*Kaladesh* Instant-Speed Tricks](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/kaladesh-instant-speed-tricks) | MTGGoldfish | Sameer Merchant

Merchant has a penchant for putting together these informative spreadsheets that guide you through the Prerelease by letting you know all of the things that are going to blow you out when you inevitably forget that they exist.


And double credit has to also be given to Monique Garraud at Hipsters of the Coast, who [put out a similar list](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2016/09/grinding-kaladesh-instants-flash-spells/) that's just as useful and slightly tweaked from what Merchant's list looks like.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Ajani on Kaladesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8d41ryJByc&feature=youtu.be&a) | Seibenlore

Why in the world is Ajani hanging out on Kaladesh? What is his connection to Tezzeret and the Gatewatch? Who does his mane? Some of these questions, and more, are explored by Seibenlore in this video.

1. [Against the Odds: Anniversary Special](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-anniversary-special) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

Happy One-Year Anniversary to one of the most consistent and consistently entertaining recurring *Magic* features around. A year may not seem like much, but when the task at hand is to play decks that are, by definition, often very bad, you come away with an appreciation for the task. Here's to another year.


1. [*Magic*'s Ten Uncompleted Card Cycles](https://www.rocketjump.com/listen/magics-ten-uncompleted-card-cycles) | Masters of Modern | Ben Bateman and Alex Kessler

I mean, we'll probably get around to some of these. We're very busy.


1. [So Many Insane Plays Podcast Episode 57: *Kaladesh*](http://www.eternalcentral.com/so-many-insane-plays-podcast-episode-57-kaladesh/) | So Many Insane Plays | Kevin Cron and Steve Menendian

I didn't think it was possible, but someone has released a set review podcast *longer* than Limited Resources. Somehow Menendian and Cron discuss *Kaladesh*'s Vintage implications for 6 hours. That is a terrifyingly impressive level of stamina. Sadly, I would guess they're not discussing [Cloudblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer).


1. [*Kaladesh* Commander Review](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33715_Kaladesh-Commander-Review.html) | StarCityGames.com | Sheldon Menery

When the godfather of Commander reviews, people listen. Get the low-down on which *Kaladesh* cards Menery thinks will make an impact in Commander.


Extra Helping of Extra Life
===========================


1. [Extra Life Features Now on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3rP64NRtmbgdTWV_8CpHATpQZogd_mYe)

If you missed the Extra Life stream from this past weekend, fret not! You can still enjoy all of the programming, as it's now on YouTube. You can check out [the entire playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3rP64NRtmbgdTWV_8CpHATpQZogd_mYe), or start watching below.

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Lots of talk about possible Modern Banlist updates. I think that Gitaxian Probe may secretly be a bigger problem than people would think.

Banned and Restricted Announcement talk has begun, and there seems to be a [ton of different opinions](https://twitter.com/TheManaSource/status/778832906609242112) all around the interwebs. That's because the announcement is coming Monday (they're almost always the Monday after Prereleases), and—well, no "and" just yet. I'm not going to tell you what's happening. Speculate away, interwebs. Speculate away.

It's in French, but never mind that. The important part is the photo, and the fact that stores like Geek Factory are getting ready to throw awesome, fun Prereleases this weekend. If you're not signed up for one, you might be missing out on dogs in goggles. Could you really forgive yourself for that?


Decks of the Day
================


1. [Updating Standard Decks with *Kaladesh*](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13524&writer=Adam+Yurchick&articledate=9-22-2016) | TCGPlayer | Adam Yurchick

Yurchick offers up many decks in today's article, all centered around updating existing decks—from Bant Humans to Jund Delirium and Blue-Red Burn. Establishing a baseline for the format is always a good start to exploring it, and all of these decks will be at least competitive based on their pedigree. Start here, invent from there.


Kyle Boggemes [does something similar on Gathering Magic](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/kyleboggemes-09222016-exploring-kaladesh-in-standard/), expanding his search into Modern to update existing lists, and Emma Handy does the same but [focused on Modern over on StarCityGames.com](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33712_Updating-Modern-Decks-With-Kaladesh.html).
