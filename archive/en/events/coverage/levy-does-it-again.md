Levy Does it Again!
===================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpsin07/champ.jpg)In Singapore, Hall of Famer Raphael Levy became one of the few players in **Magic** history to win back-to-back Grand Prix titles, and he beat a stellar Top 8 to do it. Since the Frenchman picked up Oli Ruel's copy of Domain Zoo back in Dallas, he has been nearly unbeatable, and not even the likes of both Ruel brothers, Tomoharu Saito, Osamu Fujita, Ryo Ogura, or Japan's newest force Shingo Kurihara, could defeat him here. Levy was the last player with an unblemished record in the swiss and when the dust cleared from the elimination rounds, he was also the last man standing.


Levy pulled out an extremely close match in the quarters, defeating Ogura 2-1 despite Ogura having a [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) on the table for most of Game 3. He then mauled Antoine Ruel in a semifinal mirror match, setting up his shot at history and making him the unquestioned master of the 2007 Extended season.


On the other side of the bracket, Shingo Kurihara was busy showing just how good the latest version of Balancing 'Tings can be. He defeated Tomoharu Saito's U/W Tron deck in a marathon quarterfinal, and then managed to defeat Osamu Fujita despite [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) hitting the board, giving himself a chance to play spoiler for Levy's run. Unfortunately for the young Japanese player, today was Levy's day and nothing would stop him from winning. Much like the semifinal against Antoine Ruel, Levy was never in any real danger of even having a close game in the finals, and he carefully savaged Kurihara 2-0.


Congratulations to Raphael Levy, back-to-back Grand Prix champion and the winner of Grand Prix-Singapore 2007!
