It's Demon Week, during which we spotlight those ultimate personifications of darkness. But as [Mark Rosewater](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr131) mentions in his article today, the **Horror** creature type filled in for the time when no Demons were printed, between *Fifth Edition's* 
[Lord of the Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lord%2Bof%2Bthe%2BPit) and their renaissance with *Onslaught's* 
[Grinning Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grinning+Demon). 

There will certainly still be Horrors in **Magic**'s future, however. Horrors generally have a different character from Demons, and serve a different role. Where Demons are winged, horned humanoids, Horrors are usually out-and-out monsters with little or no physical similarity to humankind. They are nightmares come alive. There are plenty of examples of Horrors; here are just a few.


  
*The look of Horrors: [Cosmic Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cosmic+Horror), [Hidden Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Horror) (which was actually originally an Undead, but definitely fits the Horror look), [Vebulid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vebulid), [Spined Fluke](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Fluke), [Vermiculos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vermiculos)*


An interesting question: are there Horror cards printed between *Fifth Edition* and *Onslaught* that might have been concepted as Demons, if policies had been otherwise? *Invasion's* 
[Devouring Strossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Strossus) looks to have been a direct descendant of [Lord of the Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Pit). And *Odyssey's* 
[Wayward Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayward+Angel) might have had the right concept to have been a "Creature - Angel Demon" rather than an Angel Horror. Can you think of others?
