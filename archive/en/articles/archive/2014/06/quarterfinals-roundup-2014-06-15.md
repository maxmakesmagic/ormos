 Even though the Grand Prix here in Moscow has been a smoothly organized tournament, you could tell that the players were starting to get exhausted after two long days of **Magic** Some had more at stakes than others, whereas Lee Shi Tian had already achieved his goal for the weekend. He locked up Platinum Pro Level by making Top 8 and that way already secured his flight ticket to Grand Prix **Magic** 2015. For everyone else, a slot there was on stake, as well as the infinite glory of taking home a Grand Prix title on home turf.
