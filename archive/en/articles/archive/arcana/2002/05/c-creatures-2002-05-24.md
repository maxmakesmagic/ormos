*Judgment* includes a cycle of common one-mana creatures (or, as R&D calls them, a cycle of "C" creatures… "C" means "a colored mana") that each can be sacrificed to produce an effect. They are: [Dwarven Scorcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Scorcher), [Cabal Trainee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Trainee), [Hapless Researcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapless+Researcher), [Benevolent Bodyguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benevolent+Bodyguard), and [Krosan Wayfarer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Wayfarer). (You can click on those card names to read the cards if you don't know what they do.)


This is not the first time such a cycle has been attempted. Back during *Tempest* design, a similar cycle was submitted. But it never bore out -- the green, white, and blue ones were cut during development. The ones that stuck? [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) and [Blood Pet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Pet).
