**Reminder: Place Redemption Orders Before March 16**


In an effort to make sure *Magic Online* is available when you want to play *Magic*, we’re working on ways to reduce the number of times we have to bring the system offline for maintenance. As a first step we’re simply going to eliminate at least one downtime each month.


Here are the dates of the exact downtimes we’ll be skipping in the first half of 2016:


* March 16
* April 6
* April 20
* May 11
* June 8
* June 22

During these weeks without a downtime *Magic Online* will NOT be processing set redemptions. **This means that if you're thinking about redemption, please submit your order before the March 9 downtime if you want your order processed before March 16.** If your order isn't made prior to March 9, it won't be processed until March 23.
