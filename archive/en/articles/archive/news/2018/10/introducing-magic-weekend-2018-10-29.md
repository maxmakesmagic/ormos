October 2018 marks the ten-year anniversary of the Wizards Play Network—the organization through which your [local game store](http://locator.wizards.com/) gets promo cards, products like *Signature Spellbook*, and so on. If you've ever been to Friday Night *Magic* or a Prerelease, you've been to a WPN member store.


The WPN has been constantly evolving across its ten-year history, and it's my pleasure to introduce the latest step in that evolution: *Magic* Weekend, a rotating, quarterly, mid-season event.


Magic Weekend: An "Innovation" Event
====================================


In a way, *Magic* Weekend is less of an event than it is a *category* of events.


Think of it like *Battlebond* or *Conspiracy*. We call products like these our "Draft innovation" sets—sets that get to break the rules a little, that get permission to do things other sets can't. They happen once a year, and they're different each time.


*Magic* Weekend is the in-store play equivalent. It's our "innovation" event: a space for us to experiment, once per season, with new ideas, formats, and even prizes. The features will be new each time.


On November 9, Ravnica Weekend: *Guilds of Ravnica* will be the first of these. It began with a simple idea we'd never tried before. We thought, there are events for players who want a social experience, for players who want competition, for players who want something in between. But what about players who want *flavor*?


What would that event look like? What would the format be? What sort of prizes would we send out to stores?


We're going to find out in just over a week.


Ravnica Weekend: Variations on a Theme
======================================


Right now, local game stores around the world are planning for Ravnica Weekend: *Guilds of Ravnica* and scheduling events for Ravnica Weekend: *Ravnica Allegiance*. These events represent two variations on the same theme—they're both all about Ravnica, each in their own way.


Ravnica Weekend: *Guilds of Ravnica* runs from November 9–11.


We expect these to be more like social events. The format is casual four-pack drafts (think of all the Guildgates!), Guild Kit battles, and D&D sessions based on Ravnica (taken from *Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica*). The prizes are foil basic lands and 11" x 14" prints—both of which celebrate the set's five guilds.

Ravnica Weekend: *Ravnica Allegiance* happens February 16–17, 2019.


It's more of a tournament. The format is either Standard, Draft, or Sealed (your LGS will decide when they sign up with us), plus more Guild Kit battles and D&D sessions. The prizes are *massive*: foil full-art rares, a playmat, plus more guild prints and foil guild lands.


If those prizes sound familiar, you may know what's coming next: we've collapsed promo items for Ravnica Weekend: *Ravnica Allegiance* and the Store Championship into one kit, and the ***Core Set 2019* Store Championship that happened last September will be the last event of its kind**.


These two events are just the tip of the iceberg. At each new *Magic* Weekend, you can expect new ways to play the game that we all know and love.


See you there on November 9!
