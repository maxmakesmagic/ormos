A New Dawn, a New Adventure
===========================


![ZNR Festival](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/oct_fest_adventure.png)


There's a lot to explore in the world of Zendikar, particularly when an expedition of adventurers triggers the ancient magical defenses of long-lost bastions built by the ancient kor empire, causing them (and their hidden treasures) to rise once more. Stretch your legs, gather your party, and keep your wits and limbs about you, because the Festival of Adventure is about to begin.


Festival of Adventure Events
----------------------------


* October 24–26: Cascade Singleton\*
* October 26–29: Zendikar World Tour (Preconstructed Decks)\*
* November 1–4: Mastermind
* November 7–12: On the Edge

As with our other Festival series, these events will allow you to explore the hidden depths and soaring Skyclaves that make up Zendikar—and earn you some cool in-game cosmetic rewards along the way. Things kick off on October 17 with our Zendikar World Tour, allowing you to pick and play with seven locally and sustainably sourced Zendikari decklists. In addition to the uncovering *Zendikar Rising* showcase card styles for your collection, you'll also be able to gather some words of wisdom along the way in the form of a new text emote for your collection.

For a Limited Time
==================


If you prefer to proceed in an orderly left-right-left fashion, you still have plenty of important decisions ahead of you. In addition to *Zendikar Rising*, we'll be adding multiple stops to our premier drafting itinerary for those of you who prefer group tours across the multiverse.


Upcoming Premier Draft Schedule
-------------------------------


* September 17–Winter 2020: *Zendikar Rising*
* October 23–30: *Throne of Eldraine*
* October 30–November 6: *Theros Beyond Death*
* November 6–13: *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths*

Upcoming Quick Draft Schedule
-----------------------------


* October 16–June 30: *Theros Beyond Death*
* October 30–November 12: *Zendikar Rising*

The Best of Both Worlds
=======================


![Arena Open](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/oct_arena_open.png)


We'll be closing out the month of October with the return of the Arena Open, our two-day competitive event where the top players will be able to receive monetary rewards by playing *MTG Arena*.


The Fine Print
--------------


* You must be 18 years or older to participate.
* Regional eligibility restrictions apply, void where prohibited.
* Receiving monetary rewards requires having or creating Wizards, DCI, and i-Payout accounts.
* Refer to the official Terms and Conditions for complete details.

We'll be returning to Standard Constructed for this event, and for those of you with your eyes on the prize, keep your sideboard handy, because this time you'll be able to qualify for Day 2 by playing either Best-of-One *or* Best-of-Three matches.


If you recall back to May, two of our three key pillars for this event was both ease of access and to create a competitive experience. While most of our players opt for Best-of-One matches in *MTG Arena*, we know that some of our players prefer the Best-of-Three match structure when it comes to high-level competitive play.


So, why not both?


For Day 1, there will be two options (and two in-game events, so pay attention!) in which to participate. The entry fee is the same for both, and you will be able to enter Day 1 multiple times regardless of your preferred match structure. Since there tends to be more games played per match in Best-of-Three formats ( . . . yes, we're stating the obvious here), we made adjustments to try and keep the total playtime, likelihood of qualifying for Day 2, and expected overall rewards as close as possible between the two Day 1 event structures.


Here's a side-by-side comparison:

**Format**: Best-of-One or Best-of-Three Standard Constructed  
**Start**: October 31, 2020 at 8 a.m. PT
