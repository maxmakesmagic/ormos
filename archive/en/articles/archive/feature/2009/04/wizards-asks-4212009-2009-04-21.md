*What's your favorite "griefer" strategy?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** I don't think of myself as a griefer—somebody who enjoys a game by making everyone else miserable. I'm a fun-loving Timmy, right? Tom LaPille argued during Timmy Week that [griefers are a kind of Timmy](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/29), too, but still—no way that's me.

Recently, though, I played a game of *Risk 2210 A.D.* in which I took early control of the Moon for an early burst of resources, then used nukes to break up everyone else's continent bonuses and get so far ahead that they had no chance of winning. I was having so much fun—cackling with glee, assaulting their armies from my secret base ON THE MOON, asking who wanted to be destroyed next—that I was surprised when it was pointed out that I was being kind of a jerk. I mean, what's a little cartoonish supervillainy among friends?

So I definitely have a griefer streak, and I think a lot of people do. I've got one friend who loves land destruction, and another who's crazy about stripping people's hands down to nothing. My big griefer passion in **Magic** is building an unstoppable army, as I did in that game of *Risk 2210 A.D.* How much of a griefer move this is depends on how unstoppable my army actually is.

| Timber Protector | Vesuvan Doppelganger |

In one of the first Elder Dragon Highlander games I ever played, I was eventually able to set up [Timber Protector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timber+Protector) plus [Vesuvan Doppelganger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuvan+Doppelganger) copying [Timber Protector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timber+Protector) to make nearly all of my creatures indestructible. At a lot of tables this would not be a problem at all—one quick [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), and any ordinary removal spell can cope with the remaining [Timber Protector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timber+Protector). But at a table with two people whose answers to problem creatures were [Reaper King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+King) on the one hand and [Savage Twister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Twister)–type cards on the other, my 40-plus-power army of indestructible Treefolk was actually impossible to beat. Not my fault, really—but still not fun for anybody but me.

Of course, it's easy to grief me right back on this one: concede before I get to actually smash anyone with my unstoppable army and move on to the next game. Where are you going? I haven't even attacked you yet! Come on—at least wait until I get [Leaf-Crowned Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaf-Crowned+Elder) going ....
