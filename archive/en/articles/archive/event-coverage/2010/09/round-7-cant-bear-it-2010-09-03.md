Martin Juza vs. Julien Nuijten
------------------------------


### Game 1


Martin Juza won the die-roll and, considering his aggressive white-green draft deck, obviously chose to play first. Former World champion Julien Nuijten ended up with a spicy red-black, strong on removal, but likewise weak on creatures.


Juza went off quickly with [Stormfront Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus), [Infantry Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran), and [Runeclaw Bear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear), the latter of which traded against Nuijten's first play, [Barony Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barony+Vampire). Nuijten had a replacement [Barony Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barony+Vampire) while Juza restocked on Bears—or animals, in any case—with [Silvercoat Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion).


The second time around the [Barony Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barony+Vampire) didn't take down the attacking 2/2, thanks to Juza's [Safe Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safe+Passage). Nuijten passed his turn without a play, though he did have [Combust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust) to surprise the attacking [Stormfront Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus). Unfortunately for him, Juza's Pegasus, his [Silvercoat Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion), and [Infantry Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran) were not the only ones attacking. They were joined by one of the format's sneakiest creatures, a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) surprise animated by [Awakener Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid) which made the combat step lethal.

### Game 2


For the second game Juza drew a hand of five [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Silvercoat Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion), and [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure). Tempting. . . but no. His second hand had [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) and a few white flyers; too bad it only had one [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) for land.


Juza picked up the first three cards of his next hand, and instantly declared, "Keep!" They were [Infantry Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), and [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). Unfortunately, the rest of his five-card hand turned out to be more [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains).


"I'm probably not winning this one. . ."


And sure enough, Nuijten led with a solid curve of [Barony Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barony+Vampire), [Vulshok Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker), and [Stone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Golem). Juza topdecked [Assault Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin), but the Griffin died to [Deathmark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark) and Juza soon followed under the onslaught of monsters.

### Game 3


Juza shook his head, looking at his opening seven. It did have two [Infantry Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran), [Silvercoat Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion), and once again [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), but only one [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). Nevertheless, he kept. This time risk led to reward: he had another [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) for his second turn and things were quickly looking grim for Nuijten. His [Goblin Piker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker) was a faster start than any he had had so far in the match, but still couldn't quite compare to the [Silvercoat Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion), double [Infantry Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran). He shrugged, simply attacked with the 2/1 Goblin, and summoned [Barony Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barony+Vampire).


By now, Juza had found a third land, and not just that, a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) even! This gave him the option of not casting [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) and, after thinking long and hard, he went with [Sacred Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf) instead. Nuijten cast [Black Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight), a veritable bomb against his opponent's white creatures, able to fend off [Sacred Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf) via first strike and all the others via protection from white.


Juza ripped a fourth land and took to the air with [Cloud Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader). Nuijten shot it down with [Combust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust) at end of turn, and then stole it for his side through [Rise from the Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Grave). He now controlled [Cloud Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader), [Black Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight), [Goblin Piker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker), and [Barony Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barony+Vampire) to Juza's [Sacred Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf), [Silvercoat Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion), and two [Infantry Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran)s.


Juza, however, was not willing to let go that easily. He cast [Awakener Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid) and attacked with the resulting 4/5 Treefolk, which quickly became 6/7 and put Nuijten at 6. However, Nuijten had [Deathmark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark) for the Druid. He then summoned [Chandra's Spitfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Spitfire) and attacked with Juza's own [Cloud Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader). The Czech player could only cast [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) and pass the turn right back. Nuijten attacked with his two flyers to drop Juza to 11, and also passed.


Juza went deep, deep down into the thinking tank before his next move. He had just drawn a second [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) and was pondering the possible outcomes of the turn's combat step. In the end he cast the enchantment and went in with his entire team. [Sacred Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf) and one [Infantry Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran) died on his side, [Goblin Piker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker) and [Barony Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barony+Vampire) died on Nuijten's. The second Veteran came through and Nuijten fell to 3.


[Silvercoat Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion) and [Infantry Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran) smashed in once again on the next turn, and survived thanks to Juza's [Safe Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safe+Passage). Nuijten wasn't quite as lucky, losing [Chandra's Spitfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Spitfire) as well as [Cloud Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader), and was down to just [Black Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight).


But now it was Nuijten's turn to get some help from his deck; first he got [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade), which traded with the attacking [Infantry Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran), then [Canyon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur) showed up, and finally [Sign in Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood) (down to 1) brought about [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness) which turned the former 4/4 [Silvercoat Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion) into a lowly 1/1. [Canyon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur) attacked, with [Black Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight) back on defense.


That was exactly the opening Juza needed. He summoned [Awakener Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid) and thus had two creatures able to attack. Nuijten flipped the last card in his hand, a land, which couldn't and wouldn't help him.
