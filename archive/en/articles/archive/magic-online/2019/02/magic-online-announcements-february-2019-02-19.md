Format Playoffs Begin March 23
------------------------------


Format Playoff events are the culmination of months of competition in each of the four major nonrotating formats. Modern will kick things off on March 23, followed by Legacy, Vintage, and Pauper on March 24, 30, and 31 respectively. Format Playoffs will replace Format Challenges for those dates.


Format Playoffs require a Constructed-legal deck and 35 Format Points for the event's format to enter. There are no other entry requirements, however, Format Points can only be used for Format Playoff entry, and the next opportunity to use Format Points will be in late June. Winners in the Top 8 from each format advance to the Format Championship in January.


For more information on Format Playoffs, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2019-magic-online-championship-series#FormatPlayoffs2019).

GRN & RNA Redemption

Regular redemption sets for *Guilds of Ravnica* are currently out of stock, but have been reordered. Their return date will be announced here and in the *Magic Online* Home Scene announcements as soon as the information is known. Thank you for your patience.

*Lorwyn* Flashback Drafts February 27
-------------------------------------


Get ready for all the tribal shenanigans you can handle! *Lorwyn* Flashback Drafts start Wednesday, February 27, on *Magic Online*. Just remember: [Shapesharer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapesharer) may look like an alien made of jelly, but it is definitely a Treefolk. And also a Goblin. It's a weird and wonderful world.


You can find the *Lorwyn* Flashback Drafts in the Limited Leagues section of the Play Lobby, February 27 through March 6, and players may enter with any of the following options: 10 Event Tickets; 2 *Lorwyn* boosters + 2 Event Tickets; or 100 Play Points.

Vintage Super League Week 6
---------------------------


VSL is entering Week 6, so don't miss your chance to get a weekly dose of ridiculously powerful *Magic* every Tuesday evening. The deck-building rules and tournament structure make it even more interesting and unpredictable. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy VSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about one of *Magic*'s deepest formats!


Check it out this Tuesday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/).


Ready to start playing? [Grab a deck](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/deck-lists-magic-online-products-game-info) and join the Vintage League for matches any time or play for greater rewards with the Vintage Challenge every Saturday at 10 a.m. PT.
