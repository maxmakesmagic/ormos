It is sometimes said that in the mirror, the player who casts [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) loses. It was the absolute worst card in the mirror and is often sideboarded out in exchange for [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) or [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack). If both players throw out [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn), it is the other player who gets to attack with it first.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Show+and+Tell)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell)
That was before [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience). Oh, how that changes things!


Whoever did manage to plop [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) and cast Emrakul first would usually be the victor. Both players should be smart enough to play around [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), so it seemed like the number of [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will)s and [Flusterstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flusterstorm)s drawn was the key determinant in this matchup.


**Game One** 


Both players Pondered on their first turns but Yasooka did nothing after that. He watched Harane improve his hand with [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) and [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). With the immense graveyard advantage, Harane continued to find more gas with [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time).


And then another [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). Then [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain).


All this time, Shota had done nothing. Absolutely nothing other than silently set lands into play.


His opponent had already gone through a quarter of his deck and things started to get exciting when Harane decided to pull the trigger.


Harane presented [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) which received the nod from Yasooka. Both players put [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) into play


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Omniscience)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Omniscience)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience)  
*[Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) on both sides. Somebody's going to get hurt.*
Harane started the chain reaction by casting [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). Yasooka countered with [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) and Harane countered back.


Yasooka responded with [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), and Harane tried [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish).


Yasooka respondded with another [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) and Harana tried a second copy of [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish).


It resolved, and things started to go downhill for Yasooka.


Receiving [Firemind's Foresight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firemind%27s+Foresight) (tutoring up [Flusterstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flusterstorm), [Impulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Impulse), and C[unning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=unning+Wish)), Harane proceeded to counter both of Yasooka's [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) with [Flusterstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flusterstorm).

*Kenta Harane has the last say with [Firemind's Foresight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firemind%27s+Foresight).*


  

Yasooka's seen enough and decides to concede.


**Shota Yasooka 0 – Kenta Harane 1**


**Game Two**


In the second game, Yasooka managed to cast a total of eight cantrips by his fourth turn, against his opponent's four. Despite Yasooka's attempts to sculpt the perfect hand, his hand did not seem quite as powerful as he liked.


The brawl began when Yasooka presented the first of his two sideboarded [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer)s. Harane countered with [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will). Yasooka mirrored. Harane had the last word with his second [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will).

*Yasooka's sideboard plan for the mirror.*

Yasooka's refilled with two [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) but Harane was not out of the game yet. When Yasooka tried [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction) to clean out Harane's hand (and deck) of [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will)s, Harane deftly averted the fiasco by delving the targeted card with [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). Conveniently, that also found Harane [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) to counter [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer).


Yasooka was holding on to triple [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will)s, but he refused to use them. Not even to counter [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell), risking everything just to put his own [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) into play. Of course, Harane had a copy of his own and was first to cast Emrakul.


Yet, Yasooka was not without a plan.


Firstly, he used [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast) to kill Harane's [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience), switching off all his free spells. Next, Yasooka used [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to fetch [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) to block opposing Emrakul when it charged into the red zone.


Of course, this forced him to sacrifice all of his six lands, but why did he need any of them as long as [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) remained in play? For insurance, Yasooka even popped a second copy onto the battlefield.

*Yasooka seemed to be in firm control, albeit the very interesting board. Yuuta Takahashi giggles from behind.*


Still holding on to triple [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), it seemed like Yasooka was simply waiting to draw a relevant spell. However, as misfortune would dictate, Harane had drawn way more relevant spells than he did.


Yasooka was forced to burn his Force of Wills to counter [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast) and [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). This allowed Harane to destroy the first [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) with [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast), and then using [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to [Wipe Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wipe+Away) the second copy.


Eventually, Harane reassembled the combo of [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell), [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) and Emrakul once more to put an end Yasooka's hot streak.
