If you’re getting an early taste of what *Dominaria* has to offer, it only seems fair to let you get your hands on the set earlier as well.


For *Dominaria* you can now pick up a full display booster box of the return to *Magic*’s home a week early! If you pre-order a booster box of *Dominaria* from your [local game store](http://locator.wizards.com/), you can take it home Prerelease weekend (April 21-22). Draft with friends, get a head start on your collection, build a new deck, or gather as many Legends as you can—all a week earlier! The promotion is only valid through Prerelease Weekend; after that you’ll have to wait till the release on April 27 to pick up any preordered box.


(Supplies are limited—check with your local store for details. This promotion is only available at participating stores that are members of the Wizards Play Network, so make sure you ask!)


Taking advantage of this is easy—simply talk to your local store and let them know you’d like to pre-order a box of *Dominaria* for pickup on Prerelease weekend. If they have any available, then you’re all set! And, while you’re at it, you might as well sign up for the Prerelease as well. Because Prereleases are awesome.


But that’s not all!


For *Dominaria*, we’re also doing something special with the Buy-A-Box Promo. It looks a little something like this:

This Promo is *only available with the Buy-a-Box promo*. It's not in booster packs. It's not in Bundles. It's not in any store outside of the Wizards Play Network.


That means to get a copy of Firesong and Sunspeaker you’ll need to purchase a box of *Dominaria* (as usual, while supplies last), or trade with a really nice friend of yours.


R&D specifically designed this card to be *Dominaria’s* Buy-a-Box promo. The goal was to give something cool to casual and Commander players, yes, but we’re especially excited about its implications for Brawl.


What is Brawl?


Well, Gavin Verhey is going to tell you all about it tomorrow here on DailyMTG, but the short version is that it’s a Commander variant that uses only Standard-legal cards. It’s a ton of fun, it’s been one of the most popular “for fun” formats at Wizards of the Coast this past year, and we’re introducing it with *Dominaria*.


So tune back in tomorrow to learn more from Gavin about Brawl!


In the meantime, check with your [local game store](http://locator.wizards.com/) to learn more about how you can pick up your *Dominaria* box early!
