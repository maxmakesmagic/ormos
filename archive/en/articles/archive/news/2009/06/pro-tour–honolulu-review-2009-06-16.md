The best players in the world came together at [Pro Tour–Honolulu](/en/events/coverage/mitamura-finds-gold-paradise) for sun, surf, and intense competition in both *Shards of Alara* Block Constructed and *Shards* Block Draft. Going into the tournament, everyone was talking about the **Magic Online** Championship Series Season 2 Championship Top 8, which featured an astonishing 32 copies of Bloodbraid Elf. Did the feisty Elf reign supreme? What counter-strategies emerged, and which were the most effective? Paul Jordan crunched the numbers for all the major archetypes. If you're looking for the hard numbers on what beat what, you won't want to miss it.
