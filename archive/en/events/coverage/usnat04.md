Live Coverage of 2004 United States National Championship
=========================================================




June 18-20, 2004











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/usnat04/fin.jpg)**Craig Krempels is the 2004 United States National Champion!**


In what would prove to be [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp)'s swan song in Standard, Krempels ran the CMU/Togit Elf and Nail deck through Alex Melnikow and William Postlethewait, before defeating Bill Stead in the finals. Krempels will leave Kansas City with the National Championship, a spot on the US team at this year's World Championships, and a sizeable $25,000 prize for his performance this weekend.
