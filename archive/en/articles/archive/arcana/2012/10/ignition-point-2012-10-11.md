 451 degrees fahrenheit is only relevant when you're using heat, when you use magic (or **Magic**) it doesn't matter. When you want something on fire, you get fire. 


 For example take *Return to Ravnica*'s [Explosive Impact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Impact). On it you see a Boros knight doing what Boros knights do best - punching! This time the Boros knight is punching down and using his red magic to create a blast of fire that eviscerates his enemy. 


As a member of the Boros guild, I heartily support this action and this plan.


From the art description I'd like to highlight the following line, "How'd you liked to be punched in the face with a red-hot fireball?"
