Tons of players all over the world got their first taste of the exciting new *Conflux* set this weekend at the official Prerelease tournaments! So what did you think? Are you ready to start building your brand new decks with one of the most exciting new releases in years? Decks of the Week is here to help.

First up, the most recent PTQ result is in from San Diego. Did Faeries come out on top, or has something pushed the monster from its perch atop the metagame? You'll have to click on the link to find out. And if you're looking for an upcoming PTQ near you? [We can help with that too](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/honolulu09-qualifiers).

Following that we have the hottest lists from **Magic Online** to serve as a jumping off point for your Standard, Block, Extended, and Classic redesigns with *Conflux*. There's no doubt some of the big cards from the new set will radically change the formats' respective landscapes. And as a special treat? A Premier Event featuring the Pauper format, which you can find alongside many other alternative formats on **Magic Online**.

Of course, there's more Conflux to be played! [Find a Launch Party tournament this weekend near you](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/release-facts)!
