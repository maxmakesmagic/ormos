Wizards of the Coast is also excited to announce that the Vintage Super League's first season will be streamed on [Twitch.TV/Magic](http://Twitch.TV/Magic) starting next Tuesday! The VSL, hosted and run by Hall of Famer Randy Buehler, is moving into week three of an eight-week, round-robin competition. It features ten avid Vintage fans, ranging from Hall of Famers to Eternal Weekend champions, battling it out with some of *Magic*'s most powerful and famous cards.



Four players remain undefeated, including both Vintage Championship regulars Rich Shay and Steve Menendian. After this week, players will be able to change their decks, giving the ten players a chance to trip up their opponents with brand new strategies.



Match-ups and records can be seen in the graphic above. All the action starts on [Twitch.TV/Magic](http://www.Twitch.TV/Magic) at 7 p.m. PT/2 a.m. GMT with the match between David Williams and Rich Shay.
