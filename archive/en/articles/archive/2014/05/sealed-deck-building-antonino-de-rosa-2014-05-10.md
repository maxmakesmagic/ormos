A former Grand Prix champion and US national champion with a Pro Tour Top 8 to his name as well, Antonino De Rosa certainly is one of the players to watch this weekend. And that is exactly what we did: watch him build his sealed deck.


He was joined in the feature match area by Ben Seck (whose deck-building feature you can catch on the stream later), and while De Rosa was already sorting through his cards, his old friend ambushed him and took a peek over his shoulder. "A little snooping," he joked, to which De Rosa replied: "You can help me!"





*Antonino De Rosa*

  

 Alas, as it turned out, no one could help De Rosa. He first sorted away what he considered definite unplayables, sadly quite a large stack of cards, and growing larger by the minute. Further investigation moved [Lagonna-Band Trailblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lagonna-Band+Trailblazer) to this pile too, for lack of targeted effects, and it was soon joined by [Sphinx's Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Disciple), [Kruphix's Insight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kruphix%27s+Insight), and finally all of the red.




 Black had a few good cards, though it wasn't entirely clear whether the stress here should be on the "good" or rather on the "few." Green as a potential partner offered enough cards and creatures but dubious quality overall. Next, De Rosa agonized over black-white, muttering, "This is too hard." With a creature base consisting mostly of [Leonin Snarecaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Snarecaster)s, one [Ornitharch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornitharch), and a [Sightless Brawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sightless+Brawler), it didn't take long for white to be relegated to the sidelines.




 For a while, De Rosa abandoned black and instead concentrated on green as a basis for his deck. However, that approach didn't bear fruit either and, despairing, De Rosa was quickly back to black-green. He briefly considered splashing blue for, among others, [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) and [Fleetfeather Cockatrice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleetfeather+Cockatrice). "These blue cards are good, but probably not worth adding a third color for," he explained.




 Green-black was basically the only chance he had, and he took it. "The white's not good, red isn't a color at all, and blue has no creatures," he complained. He cast a sad glance at [Extinguish All Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extinguish+All+Hope): "I probably want more enchantment creatures with this ..." To be fair, he did have [Humbler of Mortals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humbler+of+Mortals), [Nylea's Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple), [Nylea, God of the Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%2C+God+of+the+Hunt) itself, [Grim Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Guardian), and [Fate Unraveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Unraveler) along with two more bestow guys for a total of seven. "Still, I think the card is a little sketchy."





  

 Deciding on a twenty-third card was the final hurdle to pass, and De Rosa had good arguments for both [Market Festival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Market+Festival) and [Fade into Antiquity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fade+into+Antiquity). In the end, he realized he really only had 21 cards so far, and needed to play both anyway. "The only other options were [Shredding Winds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shredding+Winds) and [Cutthroat Maneuver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cutthroat+Maneuver), but I don't want another situational card and I don't have enough early drops for the Maneuver. Though I'll likely sideboard those often. Especially on the draw I'll often cut [Market Festival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Market+Festival)."



After the deck building was done, I was just about to ask the question when De Rosa turned around and put it to me: "Like my deck?"


"Well ... no."


"It's pretty bad, isn't it?" De Rosa said with a sigh. However, he was determined to defy all adversity. "I'm still going to win with it. I've had worse."


Good luck.
