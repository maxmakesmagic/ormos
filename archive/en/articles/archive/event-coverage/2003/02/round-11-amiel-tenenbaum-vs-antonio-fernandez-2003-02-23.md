### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpsev03/a936.jpg)*Amiel's Graveborn Muse almost saved him on the first game.*Fernandez's first creature was [Wretched Anurid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid), which he followed with the - you guess it - third turn morph. Amiel played Sheperd of Rot and - you guess it again - turn three morph. The Spanish used the Red Zone with glee bringing Tenenbaum to twelve before playing [Snarling Undorak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snarling+Undorak).

The French thought for a moment before playing a second morph and [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)ing his opponents' morph ([Patron of the Wild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Wild)). The two morphs gangblocked the Anurid as Amiel slipped to nine. To find more fuel the French risked [Graveborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graveborn+Muse). He was at nine and had two Zombies in play (Muse and Rot).

The Undorak pounded on and Antonio played anoter morph as a backup plan. The unforgiving Muse dropped Amiel to four, attacked and Tenenbaum played [Frenetic Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenetic+Raptor). The Rot chumped the Undorak on the next swing but Antonio flipped his unblocked morph: [Patron of the Wild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Wild).

That left Amiel at one with Muse on the table. It was time to shuffle for the second game.

Antonio 1 - 0 Amiel.

### Game 2

Fernandez's hand left him locked at two lands, even after he cycled a [Swat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat). He played two Patrons of the Wild in a vain attempt to slow things down but Amiel was in mood for mercy. The French pounded on bringing his opponent to seven before Antonio drew his third land.

Antonio 1 - 1 Amiel.

### Game 3

This time Fernandez's lands did not fail him. He played turn two [Elvish Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior), turn three [Wretched Anurid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid), turn four [Wirewood Channeler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Channeler). Meanwhile Amiel played a mere two morphs. He tried to trade them for a creature but Antonio had [Wirewood Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Pride).

His life quickly bleeding away Amiel Tenenbaum played [Cabal Archon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Archon) and traded it for [Wirewood Channeler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Channeler), but Antonio Fernandez morph turned out to be an huge green monster that left the French at a mere one life. Amiel drew his final card, praying for a miracle but nothing useful came.

**Final Result:** Antonio 2 - 1 Amiel.
