Magicthegathering.com isn't the only site that gets [redesigned](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/195) from time to time. The Wizards.com home page ([www.wizards.com](http://www.wizards.com/)), home to news, events, promotions and announcements from all games and departments of Wizards of the Coast, has gotten its fair share of facelifts as well. In fact, the look of the Wizards.com front page has changed just about every year since its shaky beginnings in 1996. Let's take a walk down the digital memory lane, shall we? 



|  |

| [Wizards.com home page circa 1996](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/wizardscom_1996Dec.jpg) **1996:** Hey, come on, be nice. It was 1996. |



|  |
| --- |
| [Wizards.com home page circa 1997](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/wizardscom_1997May.jpg) **1997:** A frames-based site focused more on recent releases than on whitespace. Or on the color white in general. |



|  |
| --- |
| [Wizards.com home page circa 1998](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/wizardscom_1998Dec.jpg) **1998:** The pendulum swings back in the direction of a static page, this time with a heavy graphic. File sizes weighed in at over 50 kilobytes! Tempers flare! |



|  |

| [Wizards.com home page circa 1999](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/wizardscom_1999Oct.jpg) **1999:** The pendulum swings back to information again, and informational updates for all Wizards brands are showcased. |



|  |
| --- |
| [Wizards.com home page circa 2000](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/wizardscom_2000Jun.jpg) **2000:** The look from 1999 remains, but as web technologies change, the back-end is starting to show its age.  |



|  |
| --- |
| [Wizards.com home page circa 2001](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/wizardscom_2001Nov.jpg) **2001:** Information everywhere. The back-end of the front page is now running from a powerful XML engine (as are all Wizards.com sites). |



|  |
| --- |
| [Wizards.com home page circa 2002](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/wizardscom_2002May.jpg) **2002:**  This year sees a subtle shift from purple to a blue color scheme in the front page, but the general layout persists. |



|  |
| --- |
| [Wizards.com home page, 2003-Present](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/wizardscom_2003May.jpg)**2003 to Present:** The pendulum has swung back in favor of a graphical, uncluttered look, with more emphasis on direct navigation to each game (such as **Magic: The Gathering**). |

  
What will the future hold for the [Wizards.com home page](http://www.wizards.com/)?
