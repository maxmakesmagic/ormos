 By now you've probably seen Ivan Floch before. A solid player from Slovakia, he has shown steady improvement since his Pro Tour debut, and has become a fixture at the top tables. Next on his to-do list is to put up a Pro Tour Top 8. He just might do it this weekend, but with three losses counting against him, he'll need to close out these four rounds. His weapon of choice in Standard is White-Blue Control, the version that drops [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) in favor of a [Quicken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicken) / [Planar Cleansing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Cleansing) package.



Sitting across from him was the first obstacle on that path in the form of Hall of Famer Jon "Kai Who?" Finkel. He was actually paired down this round, and at 10-2 is looking very good to put up what would be his fifteenth Top 8. Finkel is playing the format's boogeyman, Black Devotion Splashing White.



**What's at Stake?**




 Beyond immediate personal glory, Floch is also trying to overtake countryman and Grand Prix Coverage Superstar Matej "Big Z" Zatlkaj in the race for the captaincy of the Slovak World *Magic* Cup team. Coming into the event Zatlkaj had a four point lead, but he crashed and burned on Day 1, meaning that a Top 25 finish will give Floch the mantle.



The depth of talent in the United States means that Finkel isn't in the hunt for the Captain's chair. Really, the only thing he has left to do is remind people that he's still the Greatest of All Time. Conveniently, a win this weekend would catapult him to Platinum Pro Club status.





*Jon Finkel and Ivan Floch square off, Finkel battling mainly to reassure his place in *Magic* history, and Floch fighting for World *Magic* Cup captaincy.*
