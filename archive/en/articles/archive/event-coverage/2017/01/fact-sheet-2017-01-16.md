* Day One will consist of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 6 Swiss rounds and the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* All players with an X-3-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff.

* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

* [OVERVIEW](#-tabs-1)

* [SECOND ROUND BYES](#-tabs-3)
* [FIRST ROUND BYES](#-tabs-4)

Grand Prix tournament byes can be earned either through a player's yearly [Planeswalker Points](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/Information) total or by winning a [Grand Prix Trial](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/grand-prix-trials-event-types-events).


Byes earned through Planeswalker Points are calculated using the Planeswalker Point totals from all reported events as of the Tuesday immediately before the Grand Prix. Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix.


Winners of a Grand Prix Trial tournament are awarded two byes in the Grand Prix that it feeds. Trial byes are not cumulative with other byes and do not pass down. Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players who accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds. For complete information about Grand Prix byes and their corresponding competitive season, please check the [*Magic: The Gathering* Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents/244).
