Exploring Ixalan by Exploring Our World

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The upcoming *Ixalan* release is set in a world full of discovery, of players and characters exploring a world and searching for—well, something. We'll get to that once previews are underway. But there is a way you can explore *Ixalan* by exploring *our* world.


Next week, we will be distributing trackable game pieces to stores, fans, volunteers, and some well-known community folk that will travel the world alongside *Magic* fans. As game pieces travel, the distances they travel will influence the release of preview cards and could actually influence how the story of *Ixalan* plays out.


Here's how it works: after receiving a game piece, participants will activate and log the game pieces on [Geocaching.com](https://www.geocaching.com/play), take photos, and place them into a geocache container to start them on their explorative journey. Geocache containers stay in one place for the duration of their lifecycle, while the trackable game pieces move from container to container.


Once the trackable pieces have traveled a certain distance, new *Ixalan* preview cards will be unlocked for the community.


Later in the year (after the initial round of trackable pieces going around), each of the four tribes of *Ixalan*—Dinosaurs, Pirates, Vampires, and Merfolk—will have their own set of trackable pieces, and the distance traveled by those pieces will play out later during *Rivals* *of Ixalan*.


To find a trackable piece, check with your local game store, go to [Geocaching.com](https://www.geocaching.com/play), or watch for community members on social media to start talking up theirs.
