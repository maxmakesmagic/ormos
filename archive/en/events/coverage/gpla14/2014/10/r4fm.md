 "He is playing Jeskai, I am playing Abzan Aggro," Pardee said when I arrived at the table. The two members of Team Face to Face Games had tested together for the Pro Tour and worked together for this Grand Prix as well. Although they might have preferred to face off in the finals, the reality of the pairing was that they had to play each other in Round 4 already.



Both players have hoisted a Grand Prix trophy before (Holiday won Grand Prix San Diego 2013, while Pardee won Grand Prix Portland 2013) so they were certainly not new to the spotlight, but something that was new was Pardee's giant pink hat.
