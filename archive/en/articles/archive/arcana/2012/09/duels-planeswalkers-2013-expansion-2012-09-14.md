H ave you played **Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013**? It's a lot of fun, even if you're already an experienced **Magic** player! It's available on PC via Steam®, iPad®, Xbox LIVE®, and PlayStation® Network.


But that's not what we're here to talk about today! All the great gameplay in **Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013** is just the setup. Today, we're talking about the expansion! It's full of cards from the original *Ravnica: City of Guilds* block, so there aren't any preview cards from *Return to Ravnica*.


It's coming out on September 19 (give or take a day for platform-specific or region-specific fluctuations). It's got five playable decks whose colors correspond to the guilds in *Return to Ravnica*, plus five more puzzling challenges and ten more single-player campaign levels.


There are also additional persona portraits and unlockable achievements and trophies (depending on what platform you're playing on).
