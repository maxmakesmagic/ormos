Round 8 saw the feature match area crammed with quality. Brian Braun-Duin, Pat Cox, Conley Woods, Ben Stark, and Willy Edel were all in attendance, but our focus was on the 7-0 encounter between Jason Ascalon and Ari Lax. That's actually a little bit of a white lie, because our focus was on Lax, and the extraordinary deck he was piloting. You see, sometimes you open a pool that lets you really go the distance, and Lax got one of those pools this morning. Let's walk you through his first five turns of game one to give you a sense of what we're dealing with:



**Turn 1** – [Scoured Barrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scoured+Barrens). That gave him access on turn two to both Black and White mana. (BW)  



You might have imagined by now that Lax is playing five colors, and you'd be right. Plenty happened before Lax got there – a [Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast) from Ascalon, Lax digging for answers with [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), and Ascalon powering ahead again with [Woolly Loxodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woolly+Loxodon). That's when Lax found color number five, and used the red mana from [Bloodfell Caves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodfell+Caves) to fire off [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom), which offed the [Woolly Loxodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woolly+Loxodon). It wasn't enough. Ascalon kept on pounding away with his [Abzan Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Guide), creating a lopsided final score that thankfully for Lax still only made the game score 1-0.



**Game Two**



On the play, Lax opened on Forest, [Jungle Hollow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Hollow), and Plains. He remained at his three core colors on turn four, tapping out for [Longshot Squad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longshot+Squad). He didn't add blue until turn seven via [Dismal Backwater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismal+Backwater), but by then he'd already sent [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) to an early grave with [Smite the Monstrous](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smite+the+Monstrous), and was piling on the pressure. He also had removal for [Woolly Loxodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woolly+Loxodon), and didn't let Ascalon back into the game. It was classic foot-to-the-throat-stuff, forcing game three.
