 "Man, I haven't played against Red-Green since *Theros*," Carlo Falcis said as he looked over the Daniel Scheid's decklist. His eyes focused on each "old-school" card choice as if he were trying to remember what the deck was like all those weeks ago. Falcis is originally from the Philippines, but has been living in North Hollywood for the last ten years.




 "That's good," Daniel Scheid said. He smiled. Red-Green Monsters has been out of the limelight for a spell, thanks to all the new, shiny *Khans of Tarkir* cards. But Scheid liked his Gruuly beaters, and swore up and down that his match-ups were good. Well, sitting in the Grand Prix Semi-Finals, he was proven right. Scheid is in southern California from Oakland, and this the first time he's ever been this far.



Carlo Falcis was helming the only expected deck left standingâ€”Abzan Midrange. All the others had fallen to a host of other decks out of left field, like Monsters, for example.



**The Games**




 Carlo Falcis stumbled out of the gates in the first game. Though both players mulliganed, Falcis went down to four. That's not a great start. But despite that, the game began as it does, with [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid)s and [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic)s. Scheid remarked how well Falcis' deck was running, considering.




 Falcis went on the aggressive, with a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), but he could only say, "Oh my God," when a [Genesis Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Hydra) for seven mana came down what seemed way too early to be doing anything of the sort. This is how Scheid would punish Falcis' draw.
