[Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze*](/en/events/coverage/voice-raises-wescoe-above-all-pro-tour) showcased the top players in the world in both the *Return to Ravnica* Block Constructed format and the full *Return to Ravnica*-*Gatecrash*-*Dragon's Maze* Booster Draft. Now it's time to put that information to use at your [Friday Night **Magic**](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=events/magic/fnm)!


We distilled the most important lessons from the Pro Tour down into these helpful videos. Part I focuses on the breakout *Dragon's Maze* cards that you need to take into account across Constructed formats. Part II is all about Booster Draft and the complexities introduced by *Dragon's Maze*, delving into the draft strategies of Pro Tour–winner Craig Wescoe and two-time PT Top 8er Denniz Rachid. Finally, Part III takes a look at the end-of-season award winners and the loaded sixteen-player field for the [**Magic** World Championship](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/worldchamp/2013/players), starting July 31 in Amsterdam.
