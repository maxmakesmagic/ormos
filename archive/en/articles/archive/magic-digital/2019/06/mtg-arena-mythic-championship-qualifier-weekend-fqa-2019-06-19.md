**If you do not see the Mythic Championship Qualifier event after downloading the May 23rd game update, you need to [contact Wizards of the Coast customer support *immediately*](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000419612)**. If you do not contact customer support by Friday, May 24th at 9AM PT (16:00 UTC) you may be unable to participate due to the time needed to troubleshoot your account.


### What is the format for Day 1?


The format is best-of-three Standard constructed, including an optional 15-card sideboard. Players will play until 8 wins or 2 losses, whichever comes first. It is strongly encouraged that players begin their matches as soon as possible to ensure you have enough time to play in all of your possible matches.


### How does the match clock work?


Each player will have 30 minutes on their match clock that will count down whenever they have priority. If a player's clock runs out, they will lose the match regardless of the current win/loss record or state of the in-progress game. The match clock does not run during sideboarding.


Players can examine their clock or opponent's clock by moving their mouse over the respective timer icon on the battlefield (hourglass by the player's name). It will also automatically display when a player is low on time:


* **Game 1**: Less than 10 minutes remain on the match clock.
* **Game 2**: Less than 8 minutes remain on the match clock.
* **Game 3**: Less than 6 minutes remain on the match clock.

### When does Day 1 end?


The matchmaking queue for Day 1 will be disabled at 4PM PT (23:00 UTC). Any in-progress matches will be allowed to complete, however after this deadline players will not be able to join any new matches. Again, it is strongly encouraged that players begin their matches as soon as possible to ensure you have enough time to play all of your possible matches.


Day 2 Information
=================


### When will I know if I qualified for Day 2?


Players who achieved 7 or more match wins have locked in their spot for Day 2. Additional players who qualified based on tie-breakers will be notified via email. All players who qualified for Day 2 will receive an email approximately two hours after the end of Day 1. This email will contain important information on participating on Day 2, so please read the email carefully!


If you have finished Day 1 with 7 or more match wins, please send the following information to [esports@wizards.com](mailto:esports@wizards.com). All players will have until Sunday, May 26th at 3AM PT (10:00 UTC) to send the required information to [esports@wizards.com](mailto:esports@wizards.com).


* Full Name
* Full Display Name (Including the five digits after the #, please remember that display names are case sensitive!)

* ESL Play Account Username
* A link to a streaming channel (Twitch, YouTube, etc) if the player chooses to stream their matches.

Players who do not send the required information by the deadline may be ineligible to compete.


### When does Day 2 start?


The matches for Day 2 are scheduled to begin at 8AM PT (15:00 UTC). Additional information regarding check-in will be sent directly to eligible players via email.


### What is the format for Day 2?


The format is best-of-three Standard constructed, including an optional 15-card sideboard. Matches will be conducted through Direct Challenge using Tournament Matches:

Day 2 will consist of seven rounds of modified Swiss. We are working with [ESL Gaming](https://www.eslgaming.com/) to administer this portion of the event.

Yes, however you must use the same decklist throughout all of your matches on Day 2 (60-card main deck plus 15-card optional sidebaord). Using cards not on your submitted decklist for Day 2, or modifying your main deck with sideboard cards prior to Game 1 is grounds for disqualification.
