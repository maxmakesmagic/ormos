**Who’s going to win the World Championship?**


With Pro Tour *Magic Origins* settling who’s who for the World Championship in a few weeks, it’s natural to look ahead and make predictions.

We asked a few stars at Grand Prix San Diego to find out their calls for the crowning of a new champion.

**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:** “Hopefully me! But if not, Thiago Saprito. He’s been my friend for a long time. He’s from Brazil and he hasn’t had many opportunities to show how good he is on the world stage.”

**Matthew Nass:** “I’d have to say Jacob Wilson,” Nass said, looking left at Wilson standing next to him. “But if I had to absolutely choose someone else, Yuuya Watanabe: He’s one of the best players in the world.”

**Matt Sperling:** I’m picking Paul Rietzl or Sam Black. Selfishly, these are my friends and teammates. They’re preparing together nad have complementary skills. They’re both among the most consistent players on the Pro Tour. I’m going to help them out, but even if you don’t know them if you know they’re working together you’d be crazy not to pick them.

*No. 19-ranked Josh Utter-Leyton was a three-time World Championship competitor that narrowly missed this year’s cut.*


**Josh Utter-Leyton:** “Yuuya Watanabe. I think he is the best player in the world, and I’m rooting for him and Shahar Shenhar to meet in the best-of-five finals again.”
