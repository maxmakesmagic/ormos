 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 







This isn't The Greatest Article in the World, it's just a tribute (to a good one): [Jay Moldenhauer-Salazar's "Interlude: Investing in Real Estate."](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/interlude-investing-real-estate-2005-08-29) It's one of a handful of articles that changed my entire view of deck building and card collecting. You can read it yourself, which I recommend if you're interested in glimpsing the **Magic** of years gone by. The message is short and powerful:


* Lands that produce more than one color of mana help your decks perform significantly better. ("Significantly," as in *with statistical significance*, from science.)

There's only one major issue with referencing it today. It's outdated.


The lands, sets, and examples used invoke what was fresh and current seven years ago. We've been without the "pain lands" ([Adarkar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Wastes), [Brushland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brushland), [Karplusan Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karplusan+Forest), [Sulfurous Springs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfurous+Springs), [Underground River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+River), [Battlefield Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Forge), [Caves of Koilos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caves+of+Koilos), [Llanowar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Wastes), [Shivan Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), and [Yavimaya Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Coast)) for half of that time alone. The article preceded *Ravnica: City of Guilds* and the wonders of mana generation that followed it. JMS did a great job, but **Magic** moves fast.


Today is a new take on his original concept, updated and expanded for a world of annual core sets and dozens of new sources for colored mana. If you're peering into [*Return to Ravnica*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/returntoravnica/cig) and want to play with all the colors, today can help set you down the right path.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf214_temple_garden.jpg)### The Conditional Property of Mana


Pick your favorite spell in **Magic**; the more fun the better. (If you have several favorites, you may choose them all.) For each favorite spell you want to cast, you must provide precisely the mana required to cast it. If you do, you cast the spell and have fun. Otherwise, you cannot cast the spell and therefore cannot have fun. *Having your favorite spells and the mana to cast them means you can have fun.*


This is the fundamental nature Jay was driving at when he described good lands as the panacea to mana screw:



> 
> "I also believe that losing to mana screw is so frustrating that without good multi-lands you as a casual gamer face these options:
> 
> 
> * Play monocolored decks.
> * Play multicolor decks with lots of green.
> * Scream at your deck and die several years early from stress."
> 


When you want to do something awesome, but simply *can't*, it's annoyingâ€”at first. When your deck sabotages you repeatedly it's because the cards you're using make it likely to happen. There are a lot of ways to slice up the odds of having a hand of uncastable cards. Instead of powerful mathematics, let's recall *when* it's happened to you. Have you played in several Draft or Sealed events? When was the first, or most recent, time you built a deck that just never got its cards down?


While using *enough* sources of mana is an idea for another day, having each one create multiple colors of mana lets good things happen. Unlike Jay's era, the real secret today isn't in having as many copies of "shock lands" ([Blood Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Crypt), [Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool), [Godless Shrine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godless+Shrine), [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain), [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb), [Sacred Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry), [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents), [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground), [Temple Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Garden), and [Watery Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave)) as you think you could ever want but that you might want even more lands like them.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf214_terramorphinc_expanse.jpg)[Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) | Art by [Dan Scott](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Dan%20Scott%22%5D)


After the original *Ravnica* run, *Time Spiral* debuted with this treasure. Until that point, "fetch lands" were unique to *Onslaught*: [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta), [Bloodstained Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire), [Windswept Heath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath), [Flooded Strand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand), and [Wooded Foothills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Foothills). They were the predecessors of the enemy color cycle in *Zendikar*: [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest), [Verdant Catacombs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs), [Marsh Flats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flats), [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa), and [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn).


The fetch lands were all rare and harder to acquire. [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) was revolutionary in that it was common. Even if you count the fetch lands from *Mirage* ([Flood Plain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flood+Plain), [Grasslands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasslands), [Bad River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bad+River), [Rocky Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rocky+Tar+Pit), and [Mountain Valley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain+Valley)), the fact that *Mirage* was old when Jay *started* writing puts them far out of mind. [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) really put the power of fetching into everyone's hands.


[Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) is the modern flavor of the same common fetching and sits at hand in ***Magic** 2013*. For completionists out there, *Shards of Alara* brought common fetching in a cycle of Panoramas that could grant only some basic lands: [Bant Panorama](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Panorama), [Esper Panorama](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Panorama), [Grixis Panorama](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grixis+Panorama), [Jund Panorama](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jund+Panorama), and [Naya Panorama](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Panorama). While all seven of these lands can find *basic* lands, as opposed to basic land *types* on the rarer versions, the utility of getting the land you need is still awesome.


Hold that thought.


### Return to Subject at Hand


Wasn't Jay talking about lands that actually produced more than one color of mana, not just those that help you make more colors? Yes! Something Jay didn't know about *Ravnica: City of Guilds* was that a powerful set of common lands was about to change everything.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf214_karoo.jpg)The "karoo" or "bounce" landsâ€”*bounce* being the nickname of returning something to its owner's hand, and *karoo* refers to *Visons*'s [Karoo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karoo) with a similar effect for one-color actionâ€”were good. In fact, [Mark Rosewater shared last week](/en/node/656361) they were just that:


Â 



> "We wanted to change them out for three reasons. One, they were a little more powerful than we wanted for Limited (this was development talking). Two, the cards are a little more complex than we like at common, both in the unsummoning cost and the production of two manaâ€”and two different colors at that. Three, we knew we were repeating the shocklands (hitting the nostalgia), so we wanted the common duals to be something new (hitting the novelty)."


You can find these lands today by looking through releases like *Planechase 2012* and ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander*. The new common duals are the Gates: Azorius Guildgate, Golgari Guildgate, Rakdos Guildgate, Selesnya Guildgate, and Izzet Guildgate.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf214_gates.jpg)The Gates are a riff on older lands that enter the battlefield tapped from *Invasion*: [Coastal Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coastal+Tower), [Salt Marsh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salt+Marsh), [Urborg Volcano](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg+Volcano), [Shivan Oasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Oasis), and [Elfhame Palace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elfhame+Palace). Those older options faded away, just like the aforementioned pain variety, because we've been busy getting better lands over the past few years:


* From *Shards of Alara*: [Seaside Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seaside+Citadel), [Arcane Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum), [Crumbling Necropolis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Necropolis), [Savage Lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Lands), [Jungle Shrine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Shrine)â€”the "tri-lands."
* From *Zendikar*: [Sejiri Refuge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sejiri+Refuge), [Jwar Isle Refuge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jwar+Isle+Refuge), [Akoum Refuge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akoum+Refuge), [Kazandu Refuge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kazandu+Refuge), [Graypelt Refuge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graypelt+Refuge)â€”the Refuges.
* From ***Magic** 2010* and forward core sets: [Glacial Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Fortress), [Drowned Catacomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowned+Catacomb), [Dragonskull Summit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonskull+Summit), [Rootbound Crag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootbound+Crag), [Sunpetal Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunpetal+Grove)â€”the "M10 duals."
* From *Innistrad*: [Clifftop Retreat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clifftop+Retreat), [Isolated Chapel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isolated+Chapel), [Woodland Cemetery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Cemetery), [Hinterland Harbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinterland+Harbor), [Sulfur Falls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Falls)â€”the "Innistrad duals."
* From *Scars of Mirrodin*: [Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast), [Darkslick Shores](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Shores), [Blackcleave Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackcleave+Cliffs), [Copperline Gorge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copperline+Gorge), [Razorverge Thicket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorverge+Thicket)â€”the "Scars duals."

The shock lands are also a twist on these tapped lands. And just to pile the evidence up further, we also saw a cycle of lands that give two colors of mana but *don't* enter the battlefield tapped: the "filter lands" from *Shadowmoor* and *Eventide* ([Fire-Lit Thicket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire-Lit+Thicket), [Graven Cairns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graven+Cairns), [Mystic Gate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Gate), [Sunken Ruins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunken+Ruins), [Wooded Bastion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Bastion), [Cascade Bluffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cascade+Bluffs), [Fetid Heath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fetid+Heath), [Flooded Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Grove), [Rugged Prairie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rugged+Prairie), [Twilight Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Mire)).


There are more lands that produce multiple colors, but these are most of those that came after Jay's article. The lands to make your deck hum with the right colors of mana are more numerous today than ever before.


But there's another dimension of mana sources Jay left out: artifacts.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf214_keyrune_cycle.jpg)*Return to Ravnica*'s Keyrunes pay homage to another set of mana sources Jay didn't know about: the Signets.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf214_rav_signets.jpg)Just like the bounce lands, the Signets are powerful and have been conspicuously reprinted in several stand-alone releases. Unlike Jay's sole focus on lands, I believe using lands *as well as artifacts* helps decks. You get *more* mana to work with. You get *more* chances to have the right mana available. You get *more* cards that you can cast regardless of which lands you've been able to play. I like getting more. It's why I adore Commander so much.


Artifacts that make mana easier are more abundant than in Jay's time too:


* From *Ravnica* block: [Azorius Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Signet), [Orzhov Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orzhov+Signet), [Boros Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Signet), [Selesnya Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Signet), [Dimir Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Signet), [Izzet Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Signet), [Simic Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Signet), [Rakdos Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Signet), [Golgari Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Signet), [Gruul Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Signet)â€”the Signets.
* From *Shards of Alara*: [Obelisk of Bant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obelisk+of+Bant), [Obelisk of Esper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obelisk+of+Esper), [Obelisk of Jund](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obelisk+of+Jund), [Obelisk of Grixis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obelisk+of+Grixis), [Obelisk of Naya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obelisk+of+Naya)â€”the Obelisks.
* From *Alara Reborn*: [Fieldmist Borderpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fieldmist+Borderpost), [Mistvein Borderpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistvein+Borderpost), [Veinfire Borderpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veinfire+Borderpost), [Firewild Borderpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firewild+Borderpost), [Wildfield Borderpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfield+Borderpost)â€”the Borderposts.
* And from all over: [Coalition Relic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Relic), [Darksteel Ingot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot), [Gilded Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus), [Khalni Gem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Gem), [Manalith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manalith), [Paradise Plume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradise+Plume), [Spectral Searchlight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Searchlight), [Sphere of the Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+the+Suns), Chromatic Lantern.

Like the lists of lands, these breakouts aren't exhaustive either. My point, however, should be unassailable: Making mana of any color is easier than before, and can be done using cards across rarities.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf214_hallowed_fountain.jpg)### Returning to Our Decks


Lists, in a vacuum, are boring. What you can do with them, however, is fascinating. [This weekend's *Return to Ravnica* Prerelease events](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/Prerelease-facts) will be the first time many of us can get our hands on Gates, Keyrunes, and shock lands. It's the first time we can grab a pack and potentially open Niv-Mizzet, Dracogenius. The awesome coming is something we've been waiting patiently for years to see.


*Keep that patience at hand*.


Whatever awesome you open, and whatever brightly colored decks you want to build, you need only jump back here to find an easy list of new cards to work with. Niv-Mizzet, Dracogenius is the legendary creature I most hope to open. It's also one that requires plenty of ways to make both blue and red mana together, ideally as a pair multiple times.


Let's tap into the Firemind for an example of how we can work this out for a sixty-card deck.


**Lands of the Dracogenius 1**


13 [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)  

13 [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)


Â 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Island | Mountain |

Twenty-six lands is a fair amount for handling sixty cards. Whatever spells we play alongside the new Niv-Mizzet will probably include a few that draw cards. Over a long enough game, we'll have a pretty even set of red and blue mana sources. However, this isn't thinking like an Izzet yet.


**Lands of the Dracogenius 2**


4 Izzet Keyrune  

4 Izzet Guildgate  

4 [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds)  

9 [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)  

9 [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)


Â 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Izzet Keyrune | Izzet Guildgate |

All I've done is swap out eight basic lands for four each of Izzet Guildgate and [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds). This almost assuredly provides easy pairings of red and blue mana, with Izzet Keyrunes both playing along and helping us reach our Dracogenius mana faster. But this is far too mundane for any self-experimenting Izzet.


**Lands of the Dracogenius 3**


3 [Izzet Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Signet)  

3 Izzet Keyrune  

2 [Izzet Boilerworks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Boilerworks)  

4 Izzet Guildgate  

4 [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents)  

4 [Sulfur Falls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Falls)  

6 [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)  

6 [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)


Â

Izzet Signet

Izzet Boilerworks

Mana should hardly slow us down here. Bringing together both newer and older ways to make blue and red mana means landing Niv-Mizzet, Dracogenius, which should result in a lot of damage getting thrown around. But even here an Izzet would scoff.


**Lands of the Dracogenius 4**


4 [Fabricate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate)  

3 Chromatic Lantern  

3 Izzet Keyrune  

2 Rogue's Passage  

2 [Desolate Lighthouse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desolate+Lighthouse)  

2 [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls)  

10 [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)  

10 [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)


Â 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Fabricate
 | Rogue's Passage |

Now we're cooking with science! Instead of focusing on just the mana sources directly, [Fabricate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate) lets an Izzet-minded mage pull a fast one with Chromatic Lantern. Once we get one into play, *any* land we have can tap for blue or red. Sneaky stuff like Rogue's Passage happens to work with partner-in-crime Izzet Keyrune (with Stealer of Secrets available in *Return to Ravnica*, too). [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) can ensure the Izzet leader will always make a splash, but the Lantern lets him use it for damage dealing too. Even [Desolate Lighthouse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desolate+Lighthouse) likes it both ways: helping us find something we want *and* getting in on red-blue mana when the Lantern is in play.


While I would most likely finish building a thematic deck around the fourth iteration above, *all of the ways to make mana are correct*. There is never "one right way" to make the mana for your decks happen, but keeping the various ways in mind can't hurt. In fact, experimenting on new ways to generate mana in decks you already haveâ€”the *most* Izzet way to play with thisâ€”can lead to you adding even more fun things to do.


At the end of the day, what you *want* is to have fun. How you get there can help make that fun happen, and being unafraid to try whatever mana you want is the only way to truly discover what can both help the fun happen and be fun in and of itself.

While I hope your [Prerelease experience](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/Prerelease-facts) is as awesome as you hope, my mind's eye is already wandering ahead. Last week I asked a simple question:




| Which legendary creature do you want to see a Commander deck for? |

| Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord | 3328 | 44.4% |
| Damia, Sage of Stone | 1882 | 25.1% |

I received four [Kresh the Bloodbraided](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kresh+the+Bloodbraided) decks through email feedback, and it was the only commander who had some sent in up front. Curiously, he scored the lowest here. But some of the reasons I like Kresh happen to match up to things Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord can do. I'm glad almost half of you are behind seeing the Golgari leader immortalized with a Commander deck, because we're going to have the chance to do that soon.


For a sneak peek into the future of themes, you can check out **DailyMTG.com**'s editor [Trick's theme breakdown](/en/articles/archive/theme-weeks-all-2012-09-21). It won't be long until the Golgari get a chance to shine in the darkness.


Join us next week when we get to populating some fields. See you then!
