 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






While this is the end of *Dragons of Tarkir*’s turn in the spotlight, *Magic Origins* is ready to take over. With its card image gallery filled to the brim just before Grand Prix Montreal, several players have already turned their thoughts forward to what’s coming soon.

“I’m excited for the new [Siege-Gang Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander), Chandra’s parents,” No. 17-ranked Alexander Hayne said, referring to Pia and Kiran Nalaar. Mike Sigrist, staring Hayne down on the right above, had a different tack in mind: “Erebos’s Titan.”

“There are too many cards,” No 7-ranked and Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* champion Ari Lax said, with a grin on his face. “There are literally twenty cards I’m excited for. Each of them do something interesting.”

Kenji Egashira, better known to say hello of friends as *Magic Online* streamer Numot the Nummy, knew exactly what we wanted to see first. “The 6/6 with renowned 6,” he said, meaning the biggest of the baddies coming in *Origins*: Outland Colossus.
