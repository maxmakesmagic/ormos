![Ostrovich vs Budde](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/934.jpg)Diego Ostrovich had a solid season last year, especially on the Grand Prix circuit. Just as he and Carlos Romao made Latin American Magic a force on the Pro Tour at Worlds last year, they followed up with strong showings, proving that their success was not a fluke. Kai Budde, on the other hand, hasn't even won a Pro Tour this season! Granted, there's only been one so far, but after Phoenix Foundation steamrolled the competition on the way to Sunday, many assumed it was a foregone conclusion that they would three-peat. But, it was not to be, as they lost to eventual champions The Brockafellas- the result of which was so stunning that the crowd was silent in disbelief. Needless to say, it wouldn't quite be a Pro Tour season without Kai winning at least one of the events, and he's looking to do it here. With a record of 4-1, he's well on his way.

### Game 1

![Ostrovich! Zoom!](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/935.jpg)Both players mulliganed down to six. Ostrovich opened with [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) and [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), and Budde had a first turn Monolith as well off [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors). [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) and [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) gave Ostrovich more to work with, while Budde played [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) and a Dynamo. Ostrovich was the first to use all that mana to play a big spell, casting [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) to draw eight cards. He then played [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) for one, and ended his turn. Budde [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed for [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and activated it, looking at Ostrovich's hand of island, two Chalices, two Dynamos, [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) and [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors). The Dynamo was [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed into [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), as Budde lamented, "There's nothing in there that kills you." A Chalice came out on four, nullifying most of Ostrovich's hand. Budde followed up on his turn with [Mishra's Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Helix), which wasn't terribly threatening since Ostrovich had a Key and two Monoliths. He played his third Chalice of the game, setting it to three. 

The game slowed to a crawl at this point, as Budde merely drew a card every turn and used the Helix on Ostrovich's upkeep. Eventually he found [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius), and used it to draw seven cards, but it didn't do much good. Ostrovich cast an [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and floated plenty of mana, and Budde responded by [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) to draw six cards. With the mana he had left, Ostrovich played three Monoliths, two [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo)s, [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) and [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) set to two. On the following turn, the [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) attacked for four, and Ostrovich played another Chalice set to four. With his options severely limited, Budde cast [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) to get a [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) into play, and a third [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) let him play [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus). Meanwhile, the [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) was attacking every turn, and Budde would need to find an answer or a massive threat of his own. He found one soon, casting [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) with lots of mana to spare. All the mana producing artifacts came right back to the table, along with [Damping Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damping+Matrix). Ostrovich rebuilt fairly quickly, using [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) to play [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith)s, [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) and the [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore). As soon as Budde saw that Ostrovich remembered to discard, he conceded.

### Game 2

Both players had [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key)s on their first turn, and Budde followed up with a Monolith, and [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed it to get [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus). This let him play [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), while Ostrovich had nothing more than three Keys in play and some lands. [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) gave Budde five more cards, and [Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon) came out soon after, forcing a third game.

### Game 3

![This Mindslaver leaves something to be desired](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/933.jpg)Ostrovich played [Kill Switch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kill+Switch), and Budde accelerated quickly with [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) and two Dynamos. [Damping Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damping+Matrix) came out a few turns later, making Ostrovich's [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) less than impressive. However, thanks to [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) and [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), he was able to produce lots of mana and cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), playing two [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker)s after it resolved along with two [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo)s, [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) and [Kill Switch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kill+Switch). When Budde replayed all his mana producing artifacts capped off by [Damping Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damping+Matrix), Ostrovich had [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul) waiting. He then untapped and drew nineteen cards off [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius), leaving [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) free to untap a [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker). The activation produced 28 mana, and Ostrovich played [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and activated it, followed by another Key to untap the [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) and produce even more mana. [Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon), and another [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) followed. The mana left floating pumped up the Dragon enough to convince Budde to concede.
