Oh, *Time Spiral*, won’t you ever get here?

Won’t your display boxes ever proudly display those amazing spell-packed boosters to all?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1165_xr3kdfsvqfm8u975.jpg)Won’t your Fat Pack ever hover tantalizingly under the spotlight at my local gaming and/or hobby store?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1165_e1rflroicb03jqzf.jpg)Won’t the contents of said Fat Pack ever spill out in a photogenic array of durable, useful, and not to mention beautifully-illustrated **Magic** products that all can enjoy?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1165_g2zjtbnun9mas25a.jpg)Won’t I ever be able to peruse the *Time Spiral* Theme Decks, either for myself or for newer players who I believe might enjoy the throwing down of some **Magic: The Gathering**?

. . .

No, really, can I see the theme decks now?

. . .

Not yet? I should tune in to Magic Arcana later this week for hi-res pics of the theme deck packaging? Okay, fair enough.

And the [prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases) is this weekend? Understood! I’ll be there!
