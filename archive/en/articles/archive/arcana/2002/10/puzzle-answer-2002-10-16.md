Here is the answer to yesterday's [**Magic** Puzzle](/en/articles/archive/magic-puzzling-2002-10-15):


The face-down creature must be [Broodhatch Nantuko](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodhatch+Nantuko). To win the game, block the [Slipstream Eel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slipstream+Eel) with your face-down Nantuko, turn it face up, and create six Insect tokens. (Tony can use his [Daru Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Healer) to prevent one damage so you only get five tokens, but it won't make a difference.) On your turn, play [Biorhythm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm). Tony goes down to 3 life, while you actually gain life (up to 5 or 6)! Then attack with all your token creatures for the win, as Tony cannot block enough of them to survive!
