Here is a page from the *Shards of Alara* Style Guide, showing the creatures of Jund:

These guys have shown up all through the block. Consider [Savage Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Hunger) from *Shards of Alara*:

By the time the shards have fully converged in *Alara Reborn*, the creatures of Alara are showing that they belong to multiple shards. Specifically, check out [Marrow Chomper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marrow+Chomper), which would be a generic Jund monster...if it weren't for the fact that it's also *undead!*
