By Blake Rasmussen




Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The *Magic* *Story* Podcast goes behind the scenes with the people who make the worlds, create the characters, and infuse this game with imagination. This week, in a special episode of the *Magic* Story Podcast, Alison Luhrs and Kelly Digges, two important members of the creative team, will be answering a slew of fan-submitted questions.


Next week we'll have a special *Magic Story* episode featuring a familiar character, and then the *Hour of Devastation* stories start up the following week!


In the meantime, I do hope you enjoy Alison and Kelly answering questions on the mending, Tamiyo's kids, and what's made Nissa so blue.
