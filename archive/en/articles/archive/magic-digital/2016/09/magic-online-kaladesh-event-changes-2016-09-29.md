We are making changes to the entry requirements for Draft and Sealed events as well as to the redemption timeline for sets *Kaladesh* and forward. If you haven't done so already, read [Worth Wollpert's article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-online-economy-changes-2016-09-29) on these changes first. In this article, I'll discuss how these changes affect *Magic Online* events, starting with the *Magic Online* Prereleases.


*Kaladesh* Prerelease Events
============================


The changes Worth spoke of mean we will have reduced entry for Sealed and Draft events on *Magic Online*, where *Kaladesh* drafts will be 12 Event Tickets or 120 Play Points and Sealed Deck events will be 24 Event Tickets or 240 Play points.


We are excited that this change will make *Magic Online* more accessible for players to join events, and let players play more. Check out the details for *Kaladesh* Prereleases below to see the changes in action.


As Worth noted, Prereleases will begin after the Wednesday, October 5 downtime, and *Legacy Cube* events will be ending prior to that downtime.


***Kaladesh* Sealed Prerelease League**


**Start Time**: After the Wednesday, October 5 downtime  
**Closed Time**: Monday, October 10, at 10 a.m. PT  
**End Time**: Monday, October 10, at 6 p.m. PT  
**Product**: 6 *Kaladesh* boosters, plus an extra premium rare or mythic rare  
**Structure**: 5 matches, each up to 50 minutes, played at your convenience  
**Entry Options**:


* 24 Event Tickets
* 240 Play Points

**Prizes**:


* 5 wins: 5 *Kaladesh* boosters + 240 Play Points + 3 Qualifier Points
* 4 wins: 4 *Kaladesh* boosters + 120 Play Points + 1 Qualifier Point
* 3 wins: 3 *Kaladesh* boosters + 60 Play Points
* 2 wins: 2 *Kaladesh* boosters
* 1 win: 1 *Kaladesh* booster

***Kaladesh* Prerelease Draft League**


**Start Time**: After the Wednesday, October 5 downtime  
**Closed Time**: Monday, October 10, at 10 a.m. PT  
**End Time**: Monday, October 10, at 6 p.m. PT  
**Product**: 3 *Kaladesh* boosters  
**Structure**: Eight-player draft plus 3 matches, each up to 50 minutes, played at your convenience  
**Entry Options**:


* 12 Event Tickets
* 120 Play Points

**Prizes**:


* 3 wins: 4 *Kaladesh* boosters
* 2 wins: 2 *Kaladesh* boosters
* 1 win: 1 *Kaladesh* booster

We also want to make sure that your first look at *Kaladesh* on *Magic Online* is also the best time to play, so we've added a booster pack for going undefeated in the *Kaladesh* Prerelease draft!


Finally, with the latest Leagues update, we've also improved the notifications around Leagues ending, so leagues that start during *Kaladesh* will have shorter closed periods, reducing the period wherein players couldn't join a League down from two days to a few hours. You can see how much time is left right above the join button, so you know exactly how much time you have to complete the League.

*Kaladesh* Draft Events
=======================


Draft Leagues have taken *Magic Online*'s most popular event type and ratcheted up the excitement. Players are often finding matches in well under a minute, and at their own schedule and convenience.


Most of this success, however, has been in the 6-2-2-2 League. When they were queues, players were split pretty evenly between the Pack/Win and the 6-2-2-2 queues, but since the launch of Leagues the 6-2-2-2 has been dominant. As a result, we'll be ending support for the Pack/Win League with the *Kaladesh* release and consolidating Draft Leagues play into the 6-2-2-2 League.


We're aware that this change may not appeal to everyone, but the experience created by the low population in the Pack/Win league is not one that is sustainable long term. Finding matches there currently takes much longer than in the 6-2-2-2 equivalent, so we're going to prioritize players playing *Magic* over waiting to play *Magic*.


Our goal is to offer the 6-2-2-2 as the Friendly Draft League option and create a Competitive 8-4 Single-Elimination League. While this is not currently possible, the team is actively working on an update that will allow more League structures, including single elimination. Having two Draft Leagues with more distinct prizes and structures should do a better job of segmenting drafters than the structures currently offered.


***Kaladesh* 6-2-2-2 Draft League**


**Start Time**: Monday, October 10, at 10 a.m. PT  
**Closed Time**: Wednesday, January 25, at 3 a.m. PT  
**End Time**: Wednesday, January 25, at 7 a.m. PT  
**Structure**: 3 matches, up to 50 minutes each, played at your convenience  
**Product**: 3 *Kaladesh* boosters  
**Entry Options**:


* 12 Event Tickets
* 3 *Kaladesh* Boosters and 2 Event Tickets
* 120 Play Points

**Prizes**:


* 3 wins: 6 *Kaladesh* boosters + 1 Qualifier Point
* 2 wins: 2 *Kaladesh* boosters

***Kaladesh* 8-4 Draft Queue**


**Start Time**: Monday, October 10, at 10 a.m. PT  
**End Time**: When we can convert it to an 8-4 Draft League! (Details to be announced)  
**Structure**: Drafting, deckbuilding, and up to 3 matches, up to 50 minutes each  
**Product**: 3 *Kaladesh* boosters  
**Entry Options**:


* 12 Event Tickets
* 3 *Kaladesh* Boosters and 2 Event Tickets
* 120 Play Points

**Prizes**:


* 1st Place: 8 *Kaladesh* boosters + 2 Qualifier Points
* 2nd Place: 4 *Kaladesh* boosters + 1 Qualifier Point

Constructed Changes
===================


Along with the changes to Limited, we're adjusting our Constructed events at the same time by introducing a new prize you can earn! For more information, including how to get *Kaladesh* *Inventions*, check out my companion article today: "[Announcing *Magic Online* Treasure Chests!](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/announcing-treasure-chests-2016-09-29)"


Other Draft Changes
===================


Currently, *Magic Online* offers Draft support for all Standard-legal sets. Moving forward with *Kaladesh*, we're only going to offer the current Draft and the previous Draft blocks. So on October 10, the *Dragons of Tarkir*, *Magic Origins*, and *Oath of Gatewatch*-*Battle for Zendikar* Draft formats will no longer be offered. The *Eldritch Moon*-*Shadows over Innistrad* Draft Leagues will be replaced with a single 6-2-2-2 Draft queue. This draft will use the current entry-option structure: 14 Event Tickets; or 140 Play Points; or 2 *Eldritch Moon* booster packs, 1 *Shadows over Innistrad* booster pack, and 2 Event Tickets. Flashback, Cube, and special drafts will continue to be offered as normal.


Times Are Changing!
===================


We're excited for what these changes will mean for growing the *Magic Online* community and enabling many players to play more. If you have any feedback on these changes or other issues related to *Magic Online* events, please do not hesitate to reach out to [@MagicOnline](http://www.twitter.com/MagicOnline) or [@mtg\_lee](http://www.twitter.com/mtg_lee) on Twitter, or email [MagicOnlineFeedback@wizards.com](mailto:magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com).
