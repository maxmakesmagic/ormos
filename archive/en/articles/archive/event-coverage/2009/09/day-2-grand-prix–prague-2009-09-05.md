![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/day2_top.jpg)A full 199 players were qualified to play on Sunday, and 198 of them sat down early on Sunday morning for the first draft of the day. A lucky few, to precise: eight of them, would get the chance to do this two more times today to play for the win here at Grand Prix–Prague.


***Magic** 2010* has provided an environment that made some classic **Magic** moments happen even for the pros, most of whom have seen a lot of **Magic** come and go. While they are arguably chomping at the bit for *Zendikar* – and who isn't! – today they will have to concentrate in the unforgiving *M10* draft environment. Every mistake could cost them dearly, every setback could be the end on Sunday's road to glory.


Of the undefeated players, Yuuya Watanabe is the one with the most to gain, as his fellow racers to the Player of the Year title have fallen by the wayside or start off Sunday with the handicap of two losses, like Martin Juza. Watch events unfold here on dailymtg.com as Tobias Henke, Hanno Terbuyken and Rich Hagon with his podcast machine bring you all of Sunday's action, right down to the Top 8 playoffs!

Sunday, 9:50 a.m. – Drafting With Yuuya Watanabe
------------------------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

Prague is famous for its nightlife, but the lucky few (198 in all seriousness) who made it into day two weren't able to enjoy any of it. 8:30 in the morning is drafting time here at the Grand Prix and players were eager to crack some packs. Among them was former Rookie of the Year and this year's Japanese Nationals runner-up Yuuya Watanabe.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/draft1_watanabe.jpg)*Yuuya Watanabe*
His first pack contained three solid removal spells spread over three colors, [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm), [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism), and [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), but Watanabe went for the rare instead. [Magebane Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magebane+Armor) allowed him to postpone color considerations altogether. When flipping through the cards for his second pick, he noted [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), but picking [Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) left the pack without any more black.


The strongest cards available for pick three were [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight), [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino), [Wall of Frost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost), and [Looming Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Shade). Watanabe stuck to black and went with the Shade. If communication was not banned during draft, there certainly would have been a sigh coming from him now, at the sight of his fourth pick options. [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) and [Centaur Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Courser), nothing that even came close, not even to the [Centaur Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Courser), and certainly no black cards at all. After some deliberation Watanabe chose [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism). Along came a [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) as pick five, then [Emerald Oryx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emerald+Oryx) for pick six. Things were not turning out nicely for Watanabe. He did get a second [Looming Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Shade), but with three black cards in total, this 1/1 creature would be hard pressed to make an impact. Apart from that, Watanabe picked up [Pithing Needle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle), [Coat of Arms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coat+of+Arms), [Coral Merfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Merfolk), [Mist Leopard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Leopard), [Dragon's Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon%27s+Claw), and Spirit Link.



![Mind Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mind+Spring)

Pack two held [Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark), [Rhox Pikemaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+Pikemaster), [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino), and arguably the strongest card, though utterly off-color, [Mind Spring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Spring). Watanabe took [Mind Spring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Spring) anyway. Up till now he was not really settled on any color at all, afterall. Next up was [Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate), then [Drudge Skeletons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge+Skeletons), followed by [Dread Warlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Warlock), then [Xathrid Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Demon), [Warpath Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warpath+Ghoul), [Looming Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Shade) No. 3, [Weakness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weakness), and [Child of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night)... Now, that's eight solid black cards in a row, firmly establishing black as Watanabe's main color. He had systematically cut everything black from the boosters when passing to the left, and now he was rewarded for his perseverance. The rest of the pack gave him two [Bramble Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Creeper)s, [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon), and [Disentomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disentomb).


First pick in the third pack was [Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate). Then another hard decision: [Chandra Nalaar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Nalaar) or [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption)? Watanabe was not committed to any other color but black, and the fiery Planeswalker might have still made it to his deck. The Japanese pro was constantly flipping the two cards back and forth, but ultimately, he decided on [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption). A fourth [Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) was next, but that booster also held [Goblin Artillery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Artillery) in red.


The stream of good red cards continued, but Watanabe was imperturbable, taking [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight) over another [Goblin Artillery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Artillery), then [Child of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) over [Stone Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Giant), then [Drudge Skeletons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge+Skeletons) over [Capricious Efreet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Capricious+Efreet). Seventh pick was [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), and that would be the last card to realistically make his deck: [Sleep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleep), [Inferno Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Elemental), [Act of Treason](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason), [Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker), [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter), [Bountiful Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bountiful+Harvest), and [Disorient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disorient) finished up the draft.




Feature Match Round 10: Yuuya Watanabe [JPN] vs. Lukas Tajak [DEU]
------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

Both players had entered the feature match arena with no losses. One of them would have to endure defeat for the first time in the tournament. The German Lukas Tajak and the Japanese Yuuya Watanabe had sat opposite each other during the draft. Tajak already knew that Watanabe had at least a [Chandra Nalaar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Nalaar), but didn't have an inkling about how the rest of Yuuya's deck looked.


**Game 1**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/fm10_yuuya_watanabe.jpg)*Yuuya Watanabe*
Watanabe won the die roll and decided to play first, showing Swamps and Islands and no sign of red. Tajak led with [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) and [Seismic Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Strike) from his blue-red deck to kill Watanabe's [Dread Warlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Warlock), but the Japanese retaliated with [Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate). Tajak refilled with [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination), a card that most players here like a whole lot.


[Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) from Tajak tried to handle [Warpath Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warpath+Ghoul) on Watanabe's side, but the Japanese had the [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) to fizzle the sweeper. [Magebane Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magebane+Armor) spelled problems for Tajak, though he had all the means in the world to find an answer with his second [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) of the game.


[Ice Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage) was not the solution Tajak was looking for with Watanabe having the Armor to simply destroy it. But the enchantment gave Tajak time, time that he needed to get to the meat of his deck, even though Watanabe quickly killed the second [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), too.


The players had quickly sorted out their respective roles in the game. Watanabe had a defensive line-up of Drudge Skeleton and [Warpath Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warpath+Ghoul) plus a [Magebane Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magebane+Armor) that jumped around between the two. Tajak was the aggressor, with two [Berserkers of Blood Ridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserkers+of+Blood+Ridge) and [Dragon Whelp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Whelp) – and actual more cards in hand.


Having the flier meant that Tajak could take Watanabe to 9, then [Act of Treason](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) from Tajak took Watanabe's equipped [Warpath Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warpath+Ghoul). The Japanese had no defense left and scooped up his cards.


Yuuya Watanabe 0 – 1 Lukas Tajak


**Game 2**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/fm10_lukas_tajak.jpg)*Lukas Tajak*
Yuuya decided to play first. Tajak mulliganed and missed his second and third land drop. Yuuya had [Looming Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Shade) and [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight) against an empty board and threatened to goldfish Tajak to death. On 13 life already, Tajak laid his second land and [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm)'ed away the [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight) in a desperate attempt not to die. That [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) was probably the reason Tajak had kept his six-card hand, but Watanabe had left enough mana up to keep the [Looming Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Shade) alive, so Tajak had no slice, no dice and not the sliver of a chance in this game.


Yuuya Watanabe 1 – 1 Lukas Tajak


**Game 3**


No mulligans this time. Watanabe curved with [Drudge Skeletons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge+Skeletons), [Warpath Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warpath+Ghoul) and [Magebane Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magebane+Armor), though Tajak had drawn sideboard tech in [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter), immediately handling the Armor. But while Watanabe plunked down land after land up to six, Tajak was once again stuck. Three lands were just enough for [Alluring Siren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren) and [Viashino Spearhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Spearhunter). They were no match for Watanabe's [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption). Tajak's next attempt at a creature, [Stone Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Giant), was Unsummed by Watanabe while Tajak's life shrunk in six-point increments from an assorted host of attackers, including [Looming Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Shade), all the way down to zero.


Yuuya Watanabe 2 – 1 Lukas Tajak


Talking to Tobias Henke, who watched Watanabe's draft, revealed that Watanabe had drafted just two blue cards in total: [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon), and [Mind Spring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Spring). Apparently, he had followed the advice of most pros for M10 draft: Stick to one color if you can, or build a rock-solid two-color deck.




Sunday, 10:15 a.m. – Judge This!
--------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

So, what card provoked most rules questions throughout the tournament so far? Why, it's none other than the infamous [Harm's Way](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harm%27s+Way), the little card that could. The problem is that it can actually do more than most players assume from just looking at it. If, for example, your opponent casts [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) (X=3) you really *can* redirect one point of damage it would deal to your [Centaur Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Courser) as well as one damage it would deal to you (or one damage each that would be dealt to two of your [Centaur Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Courser)s, saving both). Thanks to Rules Manager Mark Gottlieb, [Harm's Way](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harm%27s+Way) now will receive a new wording, slightly altered for clarity: "The next 2 damage that a source of your choice would deal to you and/or permanents you control this turn is dealt to target creature or player instead."


Additionally, there's one nifty trick involving [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball), [Illusionary Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Servant), and one other creature, let's say [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear).


 



![Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fireball)


![Illusionary Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Illusionary+Servant)

For example, you could play [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) (X=2), pay one additional mana to target [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear)*and* [Illusionary Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Servant). Then, before [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) resolves, the Illusion will go away, leaving all the damage to be divided between [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) and... oh wait, there only *is* [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) left to be grilled, and it sure will be barbecued good and proper.


And here they are, to help out with all these tricky rules question, the judges of Grand Prix - Prague 2009, watched over by Head Judges Kevin Desperez and Frank Wareman (in red shirts) and Planeswalker [Liliana Vess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) (in fancy dress):

Feature Match Round 11 - Christian Hüttenberger [DEU] vs. Kenny Öberg [SWE]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/fm11_huettenberger.jpg)*Christian Hüttenberger*Sweden's Kenny Öberg won the die-roll and decided to draw first, which Christian Hüttenberger of Germany made good use of with a couple of early creatures: [Coral Merfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Merfolk) and [Sage Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Owl), the latter of which traded against Öberg's [Child of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night). Öberg cast [Drudge Skeletons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge+Skeletons) to put an end to Hüttenberger's advances in the red zone, but the German switched over to unblockable beatings with [Merfolk Sovereign](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Sovereign). Öberg had his own Lord with [Cemetery Reaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cemetery+Reaper), but Hüttenberger took to the air with [Snapping Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake).


Under attack from two unblockable three-power creatures life was spinning down quickly for the Swedish. At six life, Öberg finally found a [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) to take out [Merfolk Sovereign](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Sovereign), but [Snapping Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake) put him at three, while Hüttenberger added [Phantom Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Warrior) to the battlefield. Öberg drew his next card and conceded.


**Christian Hüttenberger 1 – 0 Kenny Öberg**


Despite this result, Öberg once again made Hüttenberger play first. This time, though, no one was off to a quick start, with the first creature being Hüttenberger's [Viashino Spearhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Spearhunter) on turn three, while Öberg removed [Seismic Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Strike) from Hüttenberger's hand with [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Hüttenberger dropped [Snapping Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake), Öberg had [Bog Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Wraith). Öberg rebounded with [Ant Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ant+Queen), revealing the three-colored nature of his deck and, presumably, the reason for continuously drawing first. Hüttenberger had [Wall of Frost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost) and [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), but no insecticide for the 5/5 Ant.


Still, he was dealing damage through the air while holding the fort with [Wall of Frost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost). Also, he summoned [Goblin Artillery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Artillery), further speeding up the pace of the game. In the face of this, Öberg figured that insect production would probably be too slow, so he went for massive instant token production with [Captain of the Watch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captain+of+the+Watch). Despite [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), Hüttenberger ran out of gas, while Öberg continued to drop more power onto the battlefield in the form of [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino). Hüttenberger summoned [Merfolk Sovereign](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Sovereign) to his aid, but on the defense the king of Merfolk doesn't provide much help, really. On his next turn, Öberg smashed in with his team one final time. [Wall of Frost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost) blocked [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino), and Öberg had [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) to kill the Wall, so that trample allowed for the Rhino to connect with Hüttenberger's lifetotal.


**Christian Hüttenberger 1 – 1 Kenny Öberg**


“I play first,” Hüttenberger declared.  

“So we agree on this,” Öberg quipped.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/fm11_oeberg.jpg)*Kenny Öberg*Hüttenberger led with [Coral Merfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Merfolk), followed by [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), while Öberg went without play for the first two turns, but then came back strong with [Palace Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palace+Guard). Hüttenberger stopped attacking, for now, instead just activated his Looter and cast [Snapping Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake). Öberg had [Entangling Vines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entangling+Vines) to entangle the Looter, but Hüttenberger redoubled with [Berserkers of Blood Ridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserkers+of+Blood+Ridge), which next turn traded with Öberg's freshly-cast [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino)


Hüttenberger made a second [Snapping Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake), but Öberg finally had an answer in [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider). A replacement [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) came down for the German, [Siege Mastodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Mastodon) for Öberg. Siesmic Strike tried to take out the spider, but [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) saved the day for the Swedish.


Hüttenberger found and cast [Goblin Artillery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Artillery), which later killed the [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider), when it blocked a [Snapping Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake). The other [Snapping Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake), however, came through to put Öberg at nine life.


Then Hüttenberger cast [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp), which in turn (in his extra turn) allowed him to activate [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) again, swing in for another three damage, and summon [Dragon Whelp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Whelp). This was a brutal turn (or in this case two) and left Öberg devastated beyond any possibility for recovery.


**Christian Hüttenberger 2 – 1 Kenny Öberg**


 

Sunday, 11:40 a.m. – Girls Just Wanna Have Fun
----------------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/elina_kilappa.jpg)*Elina Kilappa*Just years ago, seeing a girl playing in just about any Magic tournament turned all heads, mostly male. But not anymore. Female players are at every European GP, and while they don't do terribly well, it's not surprising anymore to get paired against one of them. It is not unreasonable to assume that the likes of Michelle Bush, Cathy Nicoloff, Kate Stavola, Kim Eikefjord, and Melissa DeToro will see some worthy successorines on the big show.


Two of those may just come out of Grand Prix Prague. It has been a while since we saw a female player playing in the main event on a Sunday, but here it has happened twice. One of the two is Elina Kilappa from Finland. The 28-year old math teacher came to Prague with nine guys, “as an extra,” she said: “I was supposed to go sightseeing today.” Instead, she relegated all her male travel companions to the Legacy event going on across the hall and made day two as the only one in her group. This is her fifth Grand Prix, but she never made the jump. “This is my first time drafting with a time limit,” Elina explained.


She passed day one with a 7-2 record, playing a green-white deck with a black splash for removal. “All the boys were saying I was playing the wrong colors for my pool – but I can't play blue!” So she didn't, despite having [Djinn of Wishes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Djinn+of+Wishes) and other assorted blue cards in her sideboard. Her secret for making day two? “I had no pressure, I just had fun!” Elina's goal for today: “One win, that would be nice!”


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/louise_johansson.jpg)*Louise Johansson*The other girl in day two is Louise Johansson, from Denmark. She also succeded beyond expectations, landing a 7-1-1 record and outperforming her boyfriend, who didn't make day two. “It feels really good!” said the 27-year old, pointing out that this was just her second Grand Prix ever. She started playing Magic just after Shadowmoor came out. “I met my boyfriend who played Magic, tried it, and got hooked.” And Magic has been good to her today: Her Sealed deck contained [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel), [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control), [Sleep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleep) and [Harm's Way](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harm%27s+Way). When Louise is not playing Magic, she works in a nursing home or cares about her two horses.


“Magic is a lot of things,” Louise went on to explain: “It is the excitement that I like most. It is never boring: If you don't like a deck, you just make a new one. There are always new things to learn, and you never get good enough.” Louise's plan originally was to come here “to learn, to have fun and to play one or two drafts.” That those drafts would be the first and second draft of day two at Grand Prix Prague, she wouldn't have guessed beforehand.

*by Tobias Henke*

This weekend, there's not only this Grand Prix in Prague, also *Planechase* Release Events are taking place all over the world, or rather: all over the Multiverse. And to be sure, players here in Prague want to join in the fun as well.

Casual games of *Planechase* are popping up everywhere around the hall... and receive a lot of attention from curious on-lookers.

While technically correct, the term “multiplayer” usually does not refer to games with two players... but don't tell them!

Sunday, 1:50 p.m. – Drafting With Matej Zatlkaj
-----------------------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/blog_draft2_zatlkaj.jpg)[Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger), [Essence Scatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter), [Goblin Artillery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Artillery), and [Dread Warlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Warlock). Those were the options Matej Zatlkaj was faced with in his first pack of today's second draft. After some consideration he went with the Ranger.


He didn't seem to be entirely happy with the next booster too: [Berserkers of Blood Ridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserkers+of+Blood+Ridge), [Oakenform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oakenform), and [Child of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) were options he contemplated, but ultimately he settled on [Sign in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood). Next he picked [Deadly Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Recluse), after taking a long and hard look at [Enormous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enormous+Baloth)'s casting cost.


Green stayed strong: Out of pack one Zatlkaj got another [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger), another [Deadly Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Recluse), [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider), [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth), and [Oakenform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oakenform)... [Mist Leopard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Leopard) and [Bountiful Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bountiful+Harvest), too. He picked [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) over [Wall of Bone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Bone), but apart from that and [Sign in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood), no black cards went to his pile.


He opened his second booster and found, among others, a [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), a [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth), and [Vampire Nocturnus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nocturnus). [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) it was for Zatlkaj.


Next up was [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption), which Zatlkaj might not be running enough black for to make worthwile. But [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight) was hardly a better option at this point. He was glad to see [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) in the next pack, but then he noticed [Cudgel Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cudgel+Troll) and took that immediately. Pick four had him choose between [Entangling Vines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entangling+Vines) and [Rod of Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rod+of+Ruin), and he was visibly torn between the two, flipping the cards, nearly deciding on the enchantment, then going with the artifact.


[Elvish Archdruid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid) and [Craw Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm) were his next picks, and then he had to read [Lurking Predators](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Predators), before determining it was indeed better than yet another [Craw Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm). An eigth-pick [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino) gladly joined his draft pile. He also scooped up a [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), then [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary), and finally [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear), before [Wall of Faith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Faith), [Disorient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disorient), and [Dragon's Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon%27s+Claw) rounded out pack two.


The third pack he opened held [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino), [Gargoyle Castle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gargoyle+Castle), and [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), and he opted for the latter. Then [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) was edged out by a second [Cudgel Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cudgel+Troll). A second [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) found his way into Zatlkaj's pool, then [Centaur Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Courser) (rather than [Rise from the Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Grave)). Concerns about the mana curve also made him pick [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) over [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino) as pick number five.


But not to worry! He was passed yet another [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino) only three picks later with [Emerald Oryx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emerald+Oryx) and a pick-seven [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger) in between. Apparently, green really was underappreciated at this table. [Regenerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regenerate), another [Emerald Oryx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emerald+Oryx), [Bramble Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Creeper), [Bountiful Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bountiful+Harvest), [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog), and [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) finished things up.

Sunday, 1:14 p.m. – Drafting with Ognjen Cividini
-------------------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

Ognjen Cividini fom Croatia has run a 12-0 streak to take his place at table one for the final draft of the Swiss. And looking at what he drafted, he had a good chance to advance to the Top 8.


 



![Tendrils of Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tendrils+of+Corruption)

Like so many pros, Ognjen concentrated on black when the opportunity arose, and that was – for him, at least – in the (weak) first pack. Between [Dread Warlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Warlock), [Goblin Artillery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Artillery) and [Serpent of the Endless Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serpent+of+the+Endless+Sea), Cividini found it an easy choice. His second pick was [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict) over [Warpath Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warpath+Ghoul) and the much-loved [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination), showing off a love for removal, whatever it might be. The third pick firmly entrenched him in black, as Ognjen happily took [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) out of an otherwise uninteresting pack.

More removal in [Gorgon Flail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorgon+Flail) and [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict) fourth and fifth showed that the overall card quality was low. [Warpath Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warpath+Ghoul) and [Zombie Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Goliath) completed Ognjen's cards from the first round of M10 cards, as the final seven picks from that booster amounted to nothing in terms of a black-white deck, with stuff like [Oakenform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oakenform) (over [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) and Polymoprh, both of which were still in the pack), [Enormous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enormous+Baloth), [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), Acolyte of Xanthid, [Bramble Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Creeper).


Booster two opened with a choice of various gifts for Ognjen when he peeled the wrapper off and saw [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight), [Dread Warlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Warlock), [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage), and [Razorfoot Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin). He took the Knight, and the goodness continued: [Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) over [Harm's Way](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harm%27s+Way) as second pick, and [Vampire Nocturnus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nocturnus) found its way into Ognjen's pile as third pick over [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight), [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage), [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict) and [Zombie Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Goliath).


 



![Vampire Nocturnus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vampire+Nocturnus)

But Cividini wouldn't be lacking for [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight)s. Picks four and six each featured the 2/2 first striker, with a [Warpath Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warpath+Ghoul) in between. [Undead Slayer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Slayer) made it over [Safe Passage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safe+Passage) as seventh pick, and then once again the supply of white and black dried up. He got a [Razorfoot Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin) in the mix, which was good, and he ended the first two boosters with 14 quality cards and some filler as a base for a really good black-white deck – given that he'd pick up some more removal in booster three, because two [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict)s and a Tendrils wouldn't cut it alone.

And booster #3 did indeed deliver. But Cividini didn't want the removal that badly, it seemed. Pick one was the hard choice between [Hypnotic Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypnotic+Specter) and [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption). Cividini picked the flier over the removal, and also took [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight) #3 over [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) as second pick, probably trying to maximize his first strikers. A third-pick [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) set him back on the removal track, a fourth-pick [Shivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon) was just a random outlier, and [Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) came to Cividini as pick five.


After that, he picked up a [Sign in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood) and a [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), and his deck was complete.


Had he indeed set his eyes on black with a splash from the very start? “It wasn't a plan, it was a hope,” said Cividini, knowing full well that everybody would be on the lookout for a black plus x combination. He was very content with his deck and felt that his draft went well enough to carry him easily into the top 8.


 

Feature Match Round 13: Ognjen Cividini [HRV] vs. Matej Zatlkaj [SLV]
---------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

We watched both players draft, and both of them do have strong decks. Zatlkaj's green creatures provide a formidable assault force. With three [Cudgel Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cudgel+Troll)s, Zatlkaj doesn't even need all the [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino)s that he drafted for his green-black deck. But Cividini's [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) are stronger than Zatlkaj's, as [Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) and [Vampire Nocturnus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nocturnus) have pushed him into a really swamp-heavy build for his black-white combination.


**Game 1:**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/fm13_matej_zatlkaj_2.JPG)*Matej Zatlkaj*Zatlkaj kicked off with a hand “that I would have kept on the draw”. Sinde he had decided to play first, though, he shipped it. But the next six looked good. [Deadly Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Recluse) entered the battlefield, preempting Cividini's [Hypnotic Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypnotic+Specter) before Zatlkaj killed it with [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption).


Cividini had more, though. [Vampire Nocturnus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nocturnus) came into play and revealed [Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) on the top of Cividini's library. Zatlkaj's [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger) was irrelevant, especially when Cividini returned [Hypnotic Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypnotic+Specter) with [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger). Zatlkaj pinned his hopes on big monsters, like [Craw Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm), but he knew that Cividini had the [Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) in hand and the monster would get just one attack in.


[Craw Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm) took Cividini to 12 and died, predictably. Cividni took a good while to deal the first damage, with [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight), and Zatlkaj used his [Deadly Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Recluse) to good effect through blocking, then returning it with [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) after it died in combat.


Zatjkaj had another [Craw Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm), Cividini had [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict). But Zatlkaj's army grew and grew, with [Centaur Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Courser) and [Craw Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm) being just the spearhead that brought Cividini to 9. Even [Vampire Nocturnus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nocturnus) had to go on blocking duty, and Zatlkaj brought [Rod of Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rod+of+Ruin) to the post-combat battlefield to mop up the undead monster.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/fm13_gameplay.JPG)*It became a convoluted battlefield before either player made a move.*


The table became cluttered. Cividini had [Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) on defense, bigger than any single creature Zatlkaj could muster, and swung through the air with [Hypnotic Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypnotic+Specter). Zatlkaj fell to 12. [Rod of Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rod+of+Ruin) was pinging away at Cividini, and the Croatian would never win that race, since Zatlkaj still had [Deadly Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Recluse) sitting there, waiting to block.


Cividini plunked down his third [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight), clogging up the ground even more. All that mattered at that point was Cividini's flier that Zatlkaj did apparently not want to block with [Deadly Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Recluse). Maybe he should have done, because when Cividini revealed [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption), Zatlkaj scooped up his cards.


Ognjen Cividini 1 – 0 Matej Zatlkaj


**Game 2:**


Cividini kicked off with [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight) and [Gorgon Flail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorgon+Flail). Zatlkaj decided to do acceleration, because his [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) and [Elvish Archdruid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid) enabled a turn four [Craw Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm). Cividini continued the knight's parade with [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight) and yet another [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight). Zatlkaj had a lot of mana, including [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger)s, easily paying for [Lurking Predators](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Predators), not lacking mana in the slightest. He was lacking for life, though: the [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight) with the [Gorgon Flail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorgon+Flail) had knocked him down to 12. Zatlkaj just amassed big creatures.


[Vampire Nocturnus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nocturnus) from Cividini triggered [Lurking Predators](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Predators), but Zatlkaj revealed just [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and put it on the bottom of his library.


“You have a lot of first strike,” Zatlkaj said.


“Some.” replied Cividini.


Cividini was just waiting for a black card to show up on his library. Zatlkaj was powerless against fliers, so Ognjen's [Razorfoot Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin) prepared the airwaves for the massive message of pain [Vampire Nocturnus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nocturnus) was eager to deliver. Zatlkaj was at 8 life when Ognjen finally had [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) on top of his library.


Ognjen went to equip [Gorgon Flail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorgon+Flail) on the Nocturnus, but Zatlkaj stopped him: [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) gave him 4 life back and killed the Vampire. Cividinis had no choice but to play Zomie Goliath instead of attacking. Then [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) (returning [Vampire Nocturnus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nocturnus))... and every time, Zaltkaj had predators lurking, always hitting a creature. With 11 green men already on the board, Zatlkaj's army looked impressive. But none of them was black, so Ognjen's [Dread Warlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Warlock) got in for two every time. And of course, [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) had helped [Vampire Nocturnus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nocturnus) return to the battlefield.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/fm13_ognjen_cividini.JPG)*Ognjen Cividini*Zatlkaj fell to 8 and used [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) to see two [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict) and [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) in Cividini's hand. “Nice deck!” quipped the Slovak, taking away Tendrils. The match had amassed a giant crowd by now.


Zatlkaj put ten creatures in the red zone. Ognjen: “I'm still at 20, so I am not worried,” but of course he had to do something there, facing 29 points of power in the red zone. Ognjen blocked with everything but [Razorfoot Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin), letting 7 damage through, going to 13. His first strikers made short work of Zatlkaj's smaller attackers, and the whole affair did not look profitable for the Slovak.


Ognjen still had his [Vampire Nocturnus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nocturnus), held at bay by two [Deadly Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Recluse)s on Zatlkaj's side. But hey – who cares about spiders when you have first-striking [Gorgon Flail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorgon+Flail)-wielding [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight)s and a [Dread Warlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Warlock) taking Zatlkaj to 8 life? [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) took out the Flail-wielding Knight and gained Zatlkaj two life. And double [Cudgel Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cudgel+Troll) made blocking more difficult for Cividini. He went to 9 life and responded with an all-out attack: [Razorfoot Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin), [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight), [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight), and [Vampire Nocturnus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nocturnus). Only the [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight) with [Gorgon Flail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorgon+Flail) staid back.


The board on Zatlkaj's side was: two [Deadly Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Recluse)s, a [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider), and two [Cudgel Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cudgel+Troll)s. One Recluse took out [Vampire Nocturnus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nocturnus), and Zatlkaj fell to 4. Ognjen followed with [Undead Slayer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Slayer), giving Zatlkaj the opportunity to use [Lurking Predators](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Predators), getting [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino).


Ognjen kept up the pressure. [Razorfoot Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin) aquired [Gorgon Flail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorgon+Flail), and took Zatlkaj to a mere 1 life.


“So what happens now if I attack?” Zatlkaj asked. “Some creatures die, some creatures live,” was Ognjen's answer. Zatlkaj also had just four cards left in his library, from too many [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth)s and of course [Lurking Predators](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Predators). He was forced to do something – but what? He picked up a slow-play warning by thinking too long and passed the turn.


[Razorfoot Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin) took [Gorgon Flail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorgon+Flail) and attacked, and this time, Zatlkaj (still on 1 life) threw the remaining [Deadly Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Recluse) in front of it. [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) feathered the attack on the next turn, but Zatlkaj had no outs – he couldn't attack without dying, he couldn't block profitably against the first strikers, he had just two cards left in his library: Matj Zatlkaj was simply dead on all counts.


Ognjen Cividini 2-- 0 Matej Zatlkaj


 

Sunday, 3:39 p.m. – Crowd Control
---------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

How do you get a long line of Magic players to stand around patiently for 20 minutes, shuffling along slowly from time to time, without running away for a draft or a game of Planechase or a stint with Duels of the Planeswalkers? Simply paint lots of beautiful land art, and be called John Avon. That's right, the maker of all lands beautiful is in the house, and man, is he drawing a crowd. Not literally, of course!


Opposite John Avon's table, Anthony S. Waters delivers a steady stream of signatures for all those who want their [Tar Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tar+Fiend)s and Circular Logics signed. Both Artists have been here all weekend, giving everybody the chance to get their favorite cardboard rectangle signed, or to buy prints or original artworks. Unless you weren't here, though – then check the GP schedule for the next Magic artist near you.

Sunday, 3:40 p.m. – The (D)ecks Files
-------------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

“Know what I just did?” Manuel Bucher asked excitedly, after sucessfully finishing his round 13 match. “My opponent had 15 life, my only creature was [Griffin Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel). I attacked... and won!”


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/blog_decks_manuel_bucher.jpg)*Manuel Bucher*Unbelievable story, so we investigated. The Swiss pro actually tapped eight mana and cast *two* [Might of Oaks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Oaks) to turn his lowly 1/3 into a monstrous 15/17 creature. With all of *three* [Might of Oaks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Oaks) in his deck, that's not even completely unlikely. (Although one could argue that *three* [Might of Oaks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Oaks) are rather unlikely all by themselves.)


“This deck doesn't have any bad cards at all,” Bucher joked. “Even [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) is great. As soon as the opponent takes two damage, he's in terrible danger.”


And indeed, it's extremely difficult to avoid being hit by [Might of Oaks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Oaks), when up against this deck. With three [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino), one [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel), and two [Griffin Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel) there are always good targets. Oh, and there are also two [Prized Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Unicorn)s in Bucher's deck, which is just evil in combination with [Might of Oaks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Oaks).

Feature Match Round 14: Richard Parker [ENG] vs. Shane Dalliston [AUS]
----------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

At the beginning of the match the two players struggled with the die-roll. No die was available, so they used local currency... or tried to, at least.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/fm14_parker.jpg)*Richard Parker*“What is heads and what is tails on these?”  

“No idea, let's just go with this here for heads.”


Shane Dalliston started quick with [Soul Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden), then [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage), while Richard Parker's first play was [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) on turn three, which took [Rod of Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rod+of+Ruin) and [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino) out of his opponent's hand.


When Dalliston added [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) to his team the score of creatures was three to none in his favor, but unfortunately all of his creatures only had one power. Parker, meanwhile, was stuck on three lands, but killed the Elves with a pin-point [Consume Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit) for one, then dismantled [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage) with [Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate)


“Check this out, Shroud!” Dalliston quipped and summoned [Mist Leopard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Leopard). But Parker had finally hit land, and cast [Bog Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Wraith), which immediately caught [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) from Dalliston. Next up, Dalliston's [Mist Leopard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Leopard) traded with Parker's [Zombie Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Goliath) to clear the way for the latter's [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino). However, Parker had [Disentomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disentomb) to retrieve [Zombie Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Goliath) and, when that traded with the Rhino, [Rise from the Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Grave) to get his own Rhino.


Dalliston was utterly out of gas by now, and went without play for multiple turns, while his own [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino) attacked him again and again. If it had not been for his [Soul Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden) still hanging around Dalliston might have been dead by now already.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/fm14_dalliston.jpg)*Richard Parker*But then Dalliston came back. First, [Entangling Vines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entangling+Vines) stopped the Rhino, then [Cudgel Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cudgel+Troll) posed a serious thread. Parker had [Drudge Skeletons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge+Skeletons) to handle the Troll, though, so the game entered a phase of draw-play-kill-go: [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) killed [Deadly Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Recluse), [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) killed [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel), [Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) killed [Centaur Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Courser), another [Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) killed [Soul Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden).


Unfortunately, this period of piece came to a sudden end, when the [Howl of the Night Pack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howl+of+the+Night+Pack) resounded. Parker couldn't do anything about the pack of eight hungry 2/2-sized wolves closing in in him and soon it was over.


**Richard Parker 0 – 1 Shane Dalliston**


Dalliston started “card advantageous” with [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) and [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger), while Parker's first play was [Bog Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Wraith) in turn four. The small green man smashed in regardless, and Parker chose not to block, fearing [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth). Post-combat, Dalliston summoned [Awakener Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid), turned one [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) into a mighty 4/5-Treefolk, still having [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) mana at the ready.


Parker thought long and hard about his options, but apparently the best his deck could muster was [Zombie Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Goliath), which was not such a sturdy defender at all. Dalliston attacked with his team (except for the [Awakener Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid) he left back), and Parker could only block [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger) with [Bog Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Wraith) and watch helplessly when [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) was delivered as expected. Dalliston also added [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage) to the battlefield.


[Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) took down the animated [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and Parker, in the face of [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage), simply attacked with [Zombie Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Goliath). That, however, allowed Dalliston to swing in with all of his men ([Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary), [Awakener Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid), [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage), and [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger), four creatures, five damage). Also, Dalliston summoned [Soul Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden) and [Mist Leopard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Leopard). Six creatures to one, this board needed some powerful black magic.


One [Consume Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit) (which took out [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage)) was not enough. Parker had already fallen behind too much. So when Dalliston cast [Rod of Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rod+of+Ruin) and started shooting additional damage, Parker soon offered his hand in concession.


**Richard Parker 0 – 2 Shane Dalliston**
