Team Modern Super League Starts Next Week!
------------------------------------------


If you liked Vintage Super League, you'll definitely like Team Modern Super League! If you didn't, you'll still probably like this one! It starts next Tuesday, February 6, and will follow the Vintage Super League schedule, airing Tuesdays at 5 p.m. PT on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). It will also involve teams, weird deck-building constraints, a novel deck-elimination system, the French word for grapefruit, and more! Get excited.


Learn more about the Team Modern Super League [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/tmsl-info/).


(Wait, you need *more* reason to get excited? We've got you covered. Watch this video!)

Two PTQs This Weekend
---------------------


This weekend brings two Pro Tour Qualifier events on *Magic Online*, both of which qualify winners for Pro Tour *Dominaria*. On Saturday, February 3, at 9 a.m. PT, the format will be Standard. There is no need to qualify for this event through a Preliminary—simply join with 30 Event Tickets or 300 Play Points.


Then, Sunday, February 4, at 7 a.m., a *Rivals of Ixalan-Ixalan* Sealed tournament will kick off. A red or blue PTQ Finals Entry Token is required to join this event.


Learn more about *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifiers [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-pro-tour-qualifiers).

*Rivals of Ixalan* Events Ongoing
---------------------------------


The clash over Orazca continues! *Rivals of Ixalan* is available for purchase in the *Magic Online* store, and Leagues and events are in full swing, so you can get your fill of Pirates, Dinosaurs, Merfolk, Vampires, plundering, exploring, and Orazca-ing whenever you want.
