Welcome back to "On the Mirrodin Site," where we show off some of the recent highlights from the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/).

### Field Reports

When the Mirrodin Site launched, it contained [field reports](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#blogs) from three characters: [Ria of Bladehold](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#!blog,499), [Farris of the Anvil](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#!blog,475), and [Kessla of Temple Might](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#!blog,472). Recently, one character's story received another chapter:

* [Farris of the Anvil's story](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#!blog,533), part 2

Two new characters' stories have begun to be told, but they're on the Phyrexian Faction. Spooky!

* [Unctus of the Synod](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#!blog,537), part 2

And check back here on Friday to see if there's anything you missed.
