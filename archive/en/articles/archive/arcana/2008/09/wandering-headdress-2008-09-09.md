Come with us now to the bygone days of *Mirrodin* block and the nearly forgotten [Healer's Headdress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Healer%27s+Headdress) from *Fifth Dawn*.

That's pretty straightforward. A metal turban of some sort with inset jewels. But it looks somehow familiar...

![Samite Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Samite+Healer)What? Is this somehow a Samite Healer's Headdress that found its way onto an all-metal plane and got, um, metallized? Let's look closer!

Yup. No question, that's the same headdress. Neat!
