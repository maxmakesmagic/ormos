Fabrizio Anteri has had an incredible season so far. Having finished 3rd at Grand Prix London, 2nd at Grand Prix Antwerp, and 1st at Grand Prix Warsaw, he is finding himself in another Grand Prix final. A win would mean not only allow him to hoist his second Grand Prix trophy in a month, but would also lock up the Gold level that would qualify him for all the Pro Tours in the next season.


Tamas Glied has not had a season as amazing as Anteri, but he has been in plenty of high-level tournaments over the years: He has a MOCS Top 4, three Pro Tour Top 75s, and a Team Worlds Top 2 finish to his name, and he is more than eager to add a Grand Prix win to his resume.

As far as decks are concerned, it's a matchup we've seen all weekend---BUG Control versus RGW Midrange---and the jury is still out on who the favorite is. BUG has the lower mana curve and the better removal spells, but RGW can ramp into bigger threats quickly. Let's find out how the games go!



**Game 1**


Glied got to play first and started with a Forest on his first turn. Anteri's turn-1 [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) revealed the following six cards:


Forest, Forest, [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr), [Destructive Revelry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Revelry), [Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), and [Xenagos, the Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler).


Anteri chose [Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), leaving Glied with two problems: the lack of a non-green mana source and a low amount of action spells.

*Fabrizio Anteri*

As it turned out, Anteri was able to deal with the first problem, but not the second: The top of his deck gave him [Temple of Abandon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Abandon), but hardly any relevant non-land spells. After Anteri destroyed Xenagos with Hero's Downfall, Glied was out of threats.



Anteri, meanwhile, had more than enough business spells: he got ahead with [Prognostic Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx) and [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave), and Glied scooped up his cards just when Kiora was about to go ultimate.

In: +1 [Read the Bones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones) +2 [Psychic Intrusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Intrusion) +1 [Unravel the Ã†ther](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unravel+the+%C3%86ther) +1 [Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver)


Out: -1 [Silence the Believers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silence+the+Believers) -1 [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave) -1 [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) -2 [Reaper of the Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds)


Glied's sideboard strategy


In: +2 [Arbor Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus) +1 [Banishing Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light) +2 [Fated Conflagration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Conflagration) +3 [Purphoros, God of the Forge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%2C+God+of+the+Forge) +2 [Revel of the Fallen God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revel+of+the+Fallen+God)


Out: -2 [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) -4 [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) -2 [Destructive Revelry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Revelry) -2 [Polis Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polis+Crusher)


**Game 2**


This was a long, drawn-out affair with the usual flurry of threats and answers. However, the late game had several interesting moments.


A key play was that Anteri managed to snag [Revel of the Fallen God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revel+of+the+Fallen+God) with [Psychic Intrusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Intrusion). The 4 tokens provided a nice defensive army to protect his [Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver), which threatened to lock up the game.

*Tamas Glied*

Anteri made the choice of ticking up his Ashiok even though Glied's [Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) revealed a less-than-threatening land on top. Anteri was hoping to snag a big creature with Ashiok, but inadvertently improved Glied's draw step: Thanks to the Ashiok activation, Glied drew [Banishing Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light) rather than a land and was actually able to take out the planeswalker.



Next, the top of Glied's deck revealed Elspeth, Sun's Champion, which allowed him to come back from a tough spot. A couple turns later, Anteri hadn't found an answer to Elspeth, and when the planeswalker gave all of Glied's creatures +2/+2 and flying, the game was over.

**Game 3**


Glied had to mulligan down to 5 cards and kept Forest, [Temple of Plenty](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Plenty), [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr), and 2 copies of [Xenagos, the Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler).


Anteri, however, used 2 [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) to strip Glied's hand, and upped the stakes by ramping into a turn-4 [Prognostic Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx). The 3/5 flyer was able to take out a planeswalker while setting up Anteri's draw steps, and Glied was unable to come back from that point.

Fabrizio Anteri does it again and takes home another Grand Prix trophy!
