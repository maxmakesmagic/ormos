They consulted the pairings and standings, and Belanger was convinced that a draw would put them both in Top 8. Bakht was not confident in his tiebreakers, and forced a playoff. Bakht opened with [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod) and [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), then [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel) and [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating). Belanger meanwhile showed mountain, island, [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel) and [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot), a board that indicated [Obliterate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate). Bakht dropped a second Plating, [Glimmervoid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmervoid), and [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) before hitting for six. Belanger mopped up with [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm).


Bakht was undaunted. He [Thoughtcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast), then used [Night's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night%27s+Whisper). He dropped [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) and Disciple before handing it back. Six damage from each Plating was bad news for Belanger. He played [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) looking for a solution. Three [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod) was not his idea of help. He untapped, drew [Discombobulate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Discombobulate), and slumped. He put out Jens and passed it back.


Bakht played another [Glimmervoid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmervoid) and a [Pyrite Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb). After paying for a [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) for one he had seven artifacts in play, enough for a free Enforcer. That put the double Plating well above lethal.


Bakht 1 - Belanger 0


A nearby Josh Rider couldn't help but cheer for Bakht's Game 1 victory. Bakht remained impassive, showing grace under pressure. You'd think this was round one of the tournament, not the match to decide Top 8. 


Belanger mulliganed into two blue, two mana leak, [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) and [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge). He Leaked Bakht's two Ravagers, then after [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault), a [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating). By turn five he still had just island and [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod) in play. Pounding his deck was useless.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat04/fm12_2.jpg)Bakht hit for one, [Thoughtcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast), and passed it back. Belanger drew island. Bakht domed him with [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) at end of turn. He untapped and swung in with his Disciple. Belanger thought, then fired [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) at it. In response, Belanger showed him two more [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast)s. That put him to one.


Belanger untapped, drew [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt), and went for [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge). He needed mountain to stay alive. He drew Bolt, Bolt, island, and extended the hand.
