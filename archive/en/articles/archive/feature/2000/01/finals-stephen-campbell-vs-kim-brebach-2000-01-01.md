The final was played in the most good natured spirit that any of the judges have agreed they have ever seen. Stephen Campbell had qualified through the Meatgrinders to reach the Final while Kim had done well in his semi final matchup.


### Game 1


Kim drew an opening hand of 6 land and a Vine Trellis and kept the hand while a confident Campbell played only land, holding his control cards in his hand until the 5th turn. Brebach's first play was a Vine Trellis on the 3rd turn while his only attempt at disruption was a Plow Under that was countered. Stephen's 6th turn Parallax Wave basically sealed the game as he began infini-Wave, removing a Hermit and company and also an Elder before Brebach conceded.


Campbell leads 1-0


### Game 2


Brebach began this game somewhat quicker than the 1st, busting out a Tangle Wire on the 3rd turn, while Campbell kept playing Diamonds to increase his mana base before he went for his lock. The game stalled out for a while Stephen defended against a Hermit and an Armageddon, with Brebach attempted to disrupt Campbell's mana base of Diamonds with 2 Splinters. Campbell eventually set up his lock and Brebach conceded again to hand the championship to Stephen Campbell.


Campbell wins the Championship 2-0.
