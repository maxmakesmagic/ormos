A few weeks ago, we saw [guild symbols in *Return to Ravnica* artwork](/en/articles/archive/guild-symbols-are-everywhere-2012-10-23). But we only scratched the surface!

For example, the birds get into the act! Check out the armor on the chest of [Judge's Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar).

The [Loxodon Smiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter) is covered in the Selesnya symbol, including on the hammer it smites with.

The [Splatter Thug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splatter+Thug) is going to war with a tattered banner that used to have the Rakdos symbol on it.

Even the arrowhead on [Avenging Arrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenging+Arrow) clearly shows the guild of the archer:
