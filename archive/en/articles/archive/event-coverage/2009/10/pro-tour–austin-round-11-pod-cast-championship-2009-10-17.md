With this being the last round of Booster Draft, the two best players in each pod of eight face off for the honor of being the king of the pod. Jonathan Melamed of Brazil faced the Malaysian Kin Leong Chong, with both players on 24 points, looking to move to 9-2. Further up the chain, Shouta Yasooka of Japan took his 25 points to battle Marcel Zafra of Canada, who sits on 27. Finally, the top of the table clash came with Canadian David Felske facing the Czech pro Martin Juza, both already at 27 points. In a wickedly fast format, expect huge swings and a stack of games where land really does matter.
