Consider, if you will, Phyresis. The *Mirrodin Besieged* Style Guide has this to say:


> **Phyresis**, the transformation of a living thing into a Phyrexian creature, can follow a variety of routes.
> 
> 
> 

Then it goes on to illustrate five of those. Would you like to see them? Here we go!

[A](javascript:void(0);) | [B](javascript:void(0);) | [C](javascript:void(0);) | [D](javascript:void(0);) | [E](javascript:void(0);)


> In some cases it seems to start from the inside working its way out ([Fig. A](javascript:void(0);)), or it may start from the outside and work its way in ([Fig. C](javascript:void(0);)).
> 
> 
> It may even start somewhere in between ([Fig. B](javascript:void(0);)).
> 
> 
> The process usually focuses on a single limb or appendage and slowly spreads and corrupts the entire creature ([Fig. D](javascript:void(0);) & [Fig. E](javascript:void(0);)).

This process ended up on a card called, appropriately enough, [Phyresis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyresis).
