![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/tournamentcenter/wizards_300.jpg)*Let Randy Buehler be your guide to a new audioscape as he brings you news and interviews from the world of **Magic** with monthly installments of the **Magic: The Gathering** podcast from the halls of Wizards of the Coast.* 


*Not only does your free iTunes subscription get you these monthly reports plus Randy's multiple daily updates during Pro Tours, but you'll also get our video segments from Pro Tours as video podcast downloads. Subscribe now and you can download the entire podcast catalog!* 


Here's what's in store this week:


* With the [2006 World Championships](/en/events/coverage/mihara-dutch-crowned-world-champions) in the books, Randy welcomes longtime R&D member Henry Stern to the booth. A regular at Worlds through the years as both a player and a Wizards of the Coast employee, Henry provides his unique perspective on the largest **Magic**  event of the year and how Wizards has changed over the years.
* *Planar Chaos*  previews are just around the corner! Before we get to the first card previews on Monday, writer Scott McGough stops by to discuss his [Planar Chaos novel](http://ww2.wizards.com/books/Wizards/Products/?doc=959157400). Are there any clues to cards and storyline to glean from the excerpt he reads? Listen in to find out.
* This Month in **Magic** is all about *Planar Chaos*. The [prerelease events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/prerelease/planarchaos) are January 20-21, and the [release tournaments](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/release/planarchaos) run Feb. 2-4 when the set goes on sale.

**WHAT IS PODCASTING?**


Podcasting is delivering audio and video content on demand so that it can be enjoyed at the user's convenience. The main benefit of podcasting is that listeners can sync content to their media player and take it with them to listen whenever they want to. But they're not just for iPodsâ€¦the files are ready to watch or listen to on just about any computer.


If you do not have iTunes:


1. Go to <http://www.apple.com/podcasting/>
2. Download iTunes version 7
3. Launch iTunes.
4. From the dropdown menus, select Advanced -- Subscribe to Podcast
5. When prompted for a URL, enter **<http://www.wizards.com/magic/rsspodcast.xml>** and click OK.

Once you subscribe to the podcast, iTunes will automatically check for new files and download them to your computer. To ensure that you get timely updates, set your Podcast Settings to check for new episodes every hour (the Settings button is in the lower-right corner of the iTunes window, or you can find it under Edit -- Preferences -- Podcast).
