It's the first Tuesday in preview week! Around here, that means it's time to unveil the *Khans of Tarkir* packaging and all of the veiled secrets those images contain. Hints abound as we look at the wrappers, boxes, and containers that hold all of those sweet, sweet *Khans of Tarkir* cards.


Let's start, as always, with the booster packs you'll be gleefully ripping open very soon.


Boosters


First up we have Sidisi, Brood Tyrant, the khan of the Sultai and [Mark Rosewater's preview card from Monday](/node/257826).

Next up is another khan, Narset, Enlightened Master. The Jeskai leader was revealed at the PAX Party over the weekend, and she kicks some serious butt.

This...creature looks cruel, unrelenting, and unyielding. Whatever could it be?

This won't be an uncommon sight on Tarkir. A warrior (Mardu, by the looks of it) preparing for her next raid.

Finally, we have this fiery looking fellow who looks positively ferocious. That flaming fist certainly isn't meant for baking pies.

And you'll find all of those boosters in one of these sweet-looking displays.

Intro Packs



Once again, we'll have five Intro Packs: one representing each of the clans. As a bonus, each of the Intro Packs will have alternative art! One of them was revealed last week, but you'll have to wait a bit longer to see the other four. For now, you'll have to make do with the packaging.

Fat Pack



Finally, the Fat Pack features the imposing visage of Zurgo Helmsmasher leading the Mardu Horde.

You'll be able to get all of these when *Khans of Tarkir* releases at a store near you on September 26. Prepare for battle.
