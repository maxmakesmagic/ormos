Formats
=======


Standard
--------


Standard is a dynamic format where you build decks and play using cards in your collection from recently released *Magic* sets. Evolving gameplay and fresh strategies make it one of the most fun and popular ways to play Magic.


Historic
--------


Historic is a non-rotating format where you build decks and play using cards in your collection from all sets currently available on *Magic: The Gathering Arena* as well as curated cards from across Magic's history. 


* [Learn More about Historic Anthology 1](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-historic-rollout-2019-11-13)

Brawl
-----


Build a deck around a specific legendary creature or planeswalker from the Standard card pool, and battle against other players in one-on-one games.


Events
======


Constructed
-----------


**Artisan**


In this *Magic: The Gathering Arena* format, all cards must be either common or uncommon rarity. Artisan events may use either Standard or Historic format legality for cards.


Banned Cards:


* [Cauldron Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cauldron+Familiar)
* [Cavalcade of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalcade+of+Calamity)

A card must be available at common or uncommon rarity on *Magic: The Gathering Arena* for it to be legal in this format. If a version of a particular card is only available as a rare/mythic rare on *Magic: The Gathering Arena*, it is not considered legal for this format (*e.g.*, [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)).
