Now the Grand Prix circuit returns to Nashville again with a Sealed Deck format, this time facing the rivals from *Innistrad*. 


Grand Prix Nashville will not only immerse you while playing **Magic**, but it will totally invigorate you in one of the most unique and historic cities in the South. Nashville is well known worldwide as Music City U.S.A., but the city also offers a taste of southern hospitality as well as some great historic landmarks. The location site is the sprawling Gaylord Opryland Hotel and Convention Center. With every possible convenience you could ask for in a hotel from fast food to fine dining, convenience store items to luxury shopping, and peaceful quiet places to an electric nightclub; Gaylord Opryland has it all under one roof. 


 Don’t take our word for it, come experience **Magic: The Gathering**  at its finest at Grand Prix Nashville. The doors open at noon Friday. Plan to stay all weekend as there are many events scheduled and plenty of side events for any player. Come get cards signed by **Magic**  artists Steve Argyle and rk post, play against spellslinger and **Magic**  R&D developer Zac Hill, and enjoy all of the events. Visit [www.tnlg.net](http://www.tnlg.net) for more information about the public events schedule as well as the latest announcements about the event. Don’t miss the Grand Prix event of the year!
