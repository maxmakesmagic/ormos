When we [last discussed Planeswalker Decks](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/ramp-approval-2016-05-16), we noted that there would be some cards in the decks that did not appear in the set, but were fully new cards. Last week [we showed you the versions of Chandra and Nissa](/node/1061151) that would come with the decks. Here they are again, in case you've forgotten.


![Chandra, Pyrogenius](https://media.wizards.com/2016/bVvMNuiu2i_KLD/en_CO4tkc9sLe.png)![Nissa, Nature's Artisan](https://media.wizards.com/2016/bVvMNuiu2i_KLD/en_YXvBDsDjHq.png)


If you pick up the Chandra deck, here are the particular cards Mark Rosewater mentioned in his article that you'll be receiving:


![Flame Lash](https://media.wizards.com/2016/bVvMNuiu2i_KLD/en_FlbIqaqeQi.png)![Liberating Combustion](https://media.wizards.com/2016/bVvMNuiu2i_KLD/en_OhojOzc1Dy.png)


![Renegade Firebrand](https://media.wizards.com/2016/bVvMNuiu2i_KLD/en_Tobx7E8U8L.png)![Stone Quarry](https://media.wizards.com/2016/bVvMNuiu2i_KLD/en_qkWdicjSwy.png)


And if you pick up the Nissa deck, then you'll receive, among other cards, these four:


![Guardian of the Great Conduit](https://media.wizards.com/2016/bVvMNuiu2i_KLD/en_KQM8W25NWY.png)![Terrain Elemental](https://media.wizards.com/2016/bVvMNuiu2i_KLD/en_BkX9yguOSV.png)


![Verdant Crescendo](https://media.wizards.com/2016/bVvMNuiu2i_KLD/en_mq0P6WU7bz.png)![Woodland Stream](https://media.wizards.com/2016/bVvMNuiu2i_KLD/en_BN3HdwyCyO.png)


Planeswalker Decks will be available just like Intro Packs were at [local stores near you](http://locator.wizards.com).
