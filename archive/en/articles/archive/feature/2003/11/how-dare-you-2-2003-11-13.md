L[ast week](/en/articles/archive/how-dare-you-2003-11-06) I presented the first wave of [Acrostic Deck Dare](/en/articles/archive/marks-deck-dare-2-2003-10-09) deck submissions. This week I will present the second (and, sadly) last wave. There were so many great decks that I could easily write another column or two just to show them off. But it's time to move on. As I've said, there were hundreds of submissions, and I thank each and every person who sent one in. Acrostics paid tribute to **Magic** artists, films, books, historical events, video games, and more. HANDEL'S MESSIAH sat alongside ROB ZOMBIE MUSIC. James Groth-Olson made a J. GROTH-OLSON autobiographical deck. Glenn Davis and Sylverfang, picking up on a jab I made in my Dare column, both made the HOMELANDS acrostic deck—and they differed by only three cards. Nick Azer's LEON CZOLGOSZ deck took its theme from President William McKinley's assassin. Jack Oldsteel's SAPROLINGS ARE AWESOME deck competed with Fednis48's SAPROLINGS ROCK effort. Benn Freeman presented a symptom-by-symptom analysis of BIPOLAR DISORDER, while Lars Node asserted that GLOWSTICKS ROCK in his rave deck. And Tad Whitmore broke the 60-card rule for his [Battle of Wits](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits) acrostic deck (THE WIZARD WHO MEMORIZES A THOUSAND BOOKS IS INSANE). Each card in that deck was related to Wizards, studying, or insanity.



Some individual card highlights? In Q Ball's SUPER SMASH BROS. deck, Pikachu was represented by [Razortooth Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razortooth+Rats). Nile Fox-Priebe's FORD PREFECT deck had [Reiver Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reiver+Demon) as the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. Chris M's COLORADO AVALANCHE deck wouldn't be complete without [Ophidian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ophidian) (the snake of an agent). Stephen Kovalcik's SPIDER-MAN COMICS deck included [Aeolipile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeolipile) as a Green Goblin pumpkin bomb, while Scott Jones's I AM SUPERMAN deck ended with [Nut Collector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nut+Collector) because "Superman rounds up crazy villains."


After three rounds of sorting still left me with 75 decks in my "really good" category, I went through one final time with a single criterion for judging them: To get into this column, the deck had to knock my socks off. I hope they knock your socks off too.


### So Bad It's Good


Here's the submission from Peter Ingraham (though he's threatening another acrostic deck based on the acrostic decks I post in my column). His theme is VERY BAD CARDS, and he's not kidding.

Each of these cards is pretty horrible on its own. However, when combined, they form an intricate, disruptable, but very evil 3-card combo! [Varchild's War-Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Varchild%27s+War-Riders) keeps giving your opponent more and more Survivor tokens. [Earthlink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthlink) and [Burning Sands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Sands) mean that if we can knock off the hordes of people fleeing from Varchild's grasp, we can make our opponent sacrifice his or her lands! That's where [Aether Flash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Flash) comes in: get the whole combo in place and your opponent has "Cumulative upkeep: Sacrifice a land." [Reckless Assault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Assault) and [Rain of Daggers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rain+of+Daggers) are hideous creature control cards that keep you alive (sort of) while you set up your combo. Divining Witch is a miserable way to find your combo pieces. [Agility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agility) is awful—but less so when you consider all the 1/1 creatures you're giving your opponent. The rest of the deck consists of subpar creatures and land. [Cyclopean Mummy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclopean+Mummy) was even voted the worst card in *Fourth Edition*!


### That's Her


Like with my [first Deck Challenge](/en/articles/archive/you-do-my-job-2003-04-10), I got a lot of music-themed decks this time around. (Of course, last time music *was* the theme.) The most stunning musical submission was Keith Bogart's deck. I was reluctant to include it because it's so long... but I had to because it's so good.

In fitting with the song, this deck is filled with Angels. Early-game options include landcycling, mana acceleration, or a face-down [Exalted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) in preparation for casting large, efficient fliers. [Oversold Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversold+Cemetery) can fetch your landcyclers back, and [Hell's Caretaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Caretaker) combos with [Spirit Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Mirror) to put those landcyclers directly into play.

### Show of Force


As I stated last week, there were lots of movie submissions. Monty Python and *Terminator* had their proponents. Fans of the *Evil Dead* movies married an acrostic theme with a Zombie deck (as did fans of *Night of the Living Dead*, Resident Evil, and Rob Zombie). There was a neat little PIRATES OF THE CARRABEAN deck that, unfortunately, had quite a fatal flaw. The most popular movie submission after *The Matrix* and *The Lord of the Rings* was, not too surprisingly, *Star Wars* (the good ones, not the new ones).

This deck is basic black-white beats with a trick or two up its sleeve. Use efficient evasion creatures ([Thermal Glider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Thermal%2BGlider), [Tethered Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Tethered%2BSkirge)) to deal early damage while [Bounty Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bounty+Hunter) and [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) secure a long-term advantage. [Solar Tide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Tide) spares your little or big creatures as necessary, while [Cold Storage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cold+Storage) and [Karmic Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic+Guide) bring them back.

 ### Double Acrostic


What really pushed Simon's submission over the top is that he included an bonus acrostic goodie for me: A deck that spells out the message "Using **Magic** cards, also do me a double acrostic"... while doing just that. It's an astonishing feat of construction that, he says, plays a bit like [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), using [Nightstalker Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightstalker+Engine) as the 'Tog.

### Fowl Play


Apparently overwhelmed by the Michael J. Fox quote "Nobody… calls me… a chicken!" in the Deck Dare column, Graham Herrli went insane. This is not the best acrostic deck I received. But it is the weirdest.

### The Scottish Play


How about a faithful retelling of *Macbeth*... in **Magic** deck form? Shawn Main provides a monoblack deck steeped in murder and ambition whose card choices are so dead-on, playing it should give you high school English credit.

Card explanations:  
**[Sengir Autocrat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Autocrat):** King Duncan and his attendants  
**[Hatred](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hatred):** Macbeth: My name's Macbeth.  
 Young Siward: The devil himself could not pronounce a title more hateful to mine ear.  
 Macbeth: No, nor more fearful. (Act V, Scene 7)  
**[Ambition's Cost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambition%27s+Cost):** Ross: Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up thine own life's means! (Act II, Scene 4)  
**[Kaervek's Spite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kaervek%27s+Spite):** Second murderer: I am one, my liege, whom the vile blows and buffets of the world have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world. (Act III, Scene 1)  
**[Eradicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eradicate):** Macbeth tries to kill both Banquo and his son Fleance to eliminate the lineage that would eventually become king.  
**[Skeletal Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying):** First Witch: Round about the cauldron go, in the poison'd entrails throw. (Act IV, Scene 1)  
**[Promise of Power](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promise+of+Power):** Third Witch: All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter! (Act I, Scene 3)  
**[Endless Scream](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Scream):** Lennox: And as they say, lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death. (Act II, Scene 3)  
**[Ascendant Evincar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascendant+Evincar):** Macbeth himself  
**[Royal Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin):** The three murderers  
**[Empyrial Plate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empyrial+Plate):** Macbeth: I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd. Give me my armour. (Act V, Scene 3)  
**[Slaughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter):** Ross: Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes savagely slaguhter'd. (Act IV, Scene 3)  
**[Mind's Eye](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Eye):** Macbeth: Art thou but a dagger of the mind, a false creation, proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? (Act II, Scene 1)  
**[Abyssal Gatekeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abyssal+Gatekeeper):** The porter  
**[Cackling Witch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cackling+Witch):** The three weird sisters  
**[Braids, Cabal Minion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Cabal+Minion):** Lady Macbeth  
**[Ebon Stronghold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ebon+Stronghold):** Dunsinane and Inverness  
**[Tortured Existence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tortured+Existence):** Macbeth: Better be with the dead, whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy. (Act III, Scene 2)  
**[Haunting Echoes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes):** Macbeth's vision of the dead Banquo.


As it should be, Lady Macbeth ([Braids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids)) drives the action, forcing you into murder. She'll keep the opponent's resources low while you sacrifice Serfs from Sengir Autocrat or your Abyssal Gatekeeper to do away with even more of the opponent's creatures. The Assassins, Slaughter, and Eradicate deal with any creatures that remain. Ebon Stronghold works surprisingly well to let you cast Hatred early. Ambition's Cost, Promise of Power, and Skeletal Scrying keep your hand full, and Ascendant Evincar, Endless Scream, Promise of Power, and Cackling Witch provide appropriate finishers.


### 'Tis the Season


I started recounting the acrostic deck submissions with a Halloween one. It seems fitting that I end with a Christmas one. Tom Laflin couldn't wait to start jingling his bells and candying his canes, so get ready for Christmas in November!

 This deck runs pretty simply: creature beatdown supported by mana acceleration and removal. Elf Replica and Dismantling Blow provide utility, and Oblation lets you deal with anything really nasty. Utopia Tree and North Star (powered by Metalworker) help stabilize the three-color mana base. If all else fails, Iridescent Angel puts your opponent on a 5-turn clock. Have fun spreading the Christmas spirit! Card explanations:
