Oops, looks like some Friday Nights spilled into this episode of Walking the Planes! But the boys from LoadingReadyRun aren't the only ones who stand out in the **Magic** community. Twitch streamer Kenji Egashira found an exceptional way to bring **Magic** into your home. Cancer survivor Maya Carroll's bravery would stand out in any crowd, even as **Magic** gave her a way to blend back in.
