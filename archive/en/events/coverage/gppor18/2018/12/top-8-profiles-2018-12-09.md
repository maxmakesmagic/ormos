None of them were especially amazing. I just beat 'em.

First Grand Prix Top 8 wasn't entirely luck! And a sweet trip and competition to look forward to.

[Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction). I played against many comp decks where the ability to destroy or discard one of their key cards and remove it from the game was very important.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**


This TOp 8 validates the thousands of dollars and hours I have spent on this game. Getting to here, my friends and wife show up to watch is moving.

[Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) has been MVP all weekend. It killed a lot of Spirits.

This Top 8 means everything to me. I've been trying to do it for a long time, and having all the work and effort and playtesting with my buddy Gunnar (the person who really helped me become the player I am today) be worth it just means the world.

Storm, because it's always the best deck! Been playing it two years and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Plus, turn two [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) for six-to-ten Goblins is great.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Pieces of the Puzzle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pieces+of+the+Puzzle). It's by far the best way to combat gratuitous amounts of graveyard hate in the metagame.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**


This is my first Grand Prix Top 8, and my first Pro Tour invite! It means everything for my *Magic* career and hopefully I can Top 8 in the future.
