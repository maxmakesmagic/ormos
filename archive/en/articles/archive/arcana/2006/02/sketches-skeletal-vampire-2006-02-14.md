Welcome to another edition of [Sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches:)! Today we take a look behind the scenes of the creation of the art of the powerful bat-generating flyer from *Guildpact*, **[Skeletal Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Vampire)**. But first, some background on the artist, Wayne Reynolds.


[Tide of War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Tide%2Bof%2BWar)
### Artist Portfolio


Fast becoming a mainstay of the **Magic** illustration multiverse, artist [Wayne Reynolds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=Wayne+Reynolds&Field_Artist=on&setfilter=Allsets&colorfilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=28&y=29) has contributed nineteen pieces of **Magic** card art from *Champions of Kamigawa* through *Guildpact*. You can see his work on such cards as [Hinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinder), [Tide of War](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tide+of+War), [Ink-Eyes, Servant of Oni](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ink-Eyes%2C+Servant+of+Oni), [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season), [Guardian of Vitu-Ghazi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardian+of+Vitu-Ghazi), and [Wreak Havoc](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wreak+Havoc), among many others. 


### Art Description


The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions given to Wayne for [Skeletal Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Vampire):



> *Color: Black  
>  Location: The sky at night  
>  Action: Show a vampire drifting through the sky (wingless). This isn't just any vampire, though -- this vampire has been reduced to a skeleton. He's all bones except for some kind of metal that encases and protects his undead heart. To show that he's a vampire and not just a floating skeleton, give him long, creepy fingers and be sure the fangs are showing. Also, two bats flutter behind him in the air like escorts.  
>  Focus: the skeletal vampire  
>  Mood: You can strip him of flesh and sinew, but you can't kill him.* 

The next step is for the artist to submit sketches of his or her vision of the art description.


### Sketch to Final Art


Here's Wayne's initial sketch submitted for [Skeletal Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Vampire):

*[Skeletal Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Vampire) sketch by Wayne Reynolds*  



Wayne nailed (or did he *stake?*) the art description right off the bat (*ugh*). The final art lines up so well to the sketch that we thought we'd let you watch the full-color final art emerge from the sketch step by step.

*Cool*. Nice job, Mr. Reynolds. In the final art you can clearly see the protective metal casing our bony friend uses to protect his sensitive heart-spot, and you can see indications of veins, sinew and possibly even organs clinging to his bones. We like how the texture of his escorts' tattered bat-wings match so well with the flayed scraps of clothing flapping behind the floating vamp. And check out the rooftops of the gloomy Ravnica district that he calls both home and hunting ground.


### Finished Card


And here's the card in its final state, as you can see in booster packs of *Guildpact*. Summon up a bat brigade over the rooftops (with a little help from Wayne Reynolds) with [Skeletal Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Vampire)!
