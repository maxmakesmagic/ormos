============================================

 If you were to name players who have had exceptional careers over a relatively short period of time, you can't look past these two. 16Th-ranked Lee Shi Tian won a Grand Prix in 2008, and Top 8'd another, but truly came into his own with a Top 8 at Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* in 2012, and another at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* earlier this year.




 Oh what? That's not a short enough time frame for you? Well then consider the man sitting across from Lee this morning: 8th-ranked Shaun McLaren has had two Grand Prix Top 8s this year, and he won Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*. Like Lee, McLaren's in his second Pro Tour Top 8 this year, as is fellow Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* competitor Ivan Floch. Something, something, skill-game, I don't think anyone needs convincing on that front these days.




 Both Lee and McLaren have faced each other already this weekend, and playing the same decks, too. Lee's version of the [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) Combo differs somewhat from many around the hall this weekend, which Lee attributes to the mana base more than his choice in spells, something he worked on with the *Magic* community in Hong Kong.





*Lee and McLaren did this dance once before in the event. McLaren was hoping that their previous match's results would repeat in the Quarterfinals.*
