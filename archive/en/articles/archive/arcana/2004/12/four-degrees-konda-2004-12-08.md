The art team works hard on a setting's style guide to make sure the look of the world, and its denizens, remains consistent. 

For example, the art of [Vassal's Duty](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vassal%27s+Duty) depicts a samurai's act of obeisance to his lord, a scene which expresses the mechanic of the card (preventing harm to legendary creatures):

*[Vassal's Duty](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vassal%27s+Duty) art by Dave Dorman*


The bowing vassal in the card is a legend himself -- you'll recognize him as the samurai Nagao, as seen on the card [Nagao, Bound by Honor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nagao%2C+Bound+by+Honor): 

[Nagao, Bound by Honor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nagao%252C%2BBound%2Bby%2BHonor)  
*[Nagao, Bound by Honor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nagao%2C+Bound+by+Honor) art by Dave Dorman*


The lord in the art of [Vassal's Duty](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vassal%27s+Duty) is on a card, too. It's the White head honcho himself, [Konda, Lord of Eiganjo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%2C+Lord+of+Eiganjo):

[Konda, Lord of Eiganjo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Konda%252C%2BLord%2Bof%2BEiganjo)  
*[Konda, Lord of Eiganjo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%2C+Lord+of+Eiganjo) art by John Bolton*


But hey, note that symbol behind daimyo Konda. See it? It's Konda's personal symbol. You'll recognize it from the card [Konda's Banner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%27s+Banner):

[Konda's Banner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Konda%2527s%2BBanner)  
*[Konda's Banner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%27s+Banner) art by Donato Giancola*


If you go a few more steps like this, I think you can get to Kevin Bacon somehow.
