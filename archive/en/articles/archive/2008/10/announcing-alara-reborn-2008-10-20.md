That's right, *Alara Reborn* is being released on **Thursday, April 30**, instead of the usual Friday. Why? Well, we're just so excited about it that we can't hold it back even an extra day! Oh, and also May 1 is International Worker's Day/Labor Day throughout Europe. There's that, too. But the point is that this means an unprecedented *four-day Launch Party*! Whoo! Be sure to check back to **magicthegathering.com** this spring for more details and updates.
