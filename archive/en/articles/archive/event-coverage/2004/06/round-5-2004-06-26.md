Nils Vermehren vs. David Montreuil
----------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpzur04/fm4_1.jpg)Two Pro-caliber players battling it out to keep their perfect record. The reason why they are up here, it's David. The Cinderella story from the European Championships in Milan a few years ago. A Canadian leaving in Switzerland on a scolarship he walked into a regionals for an afternoon of fun... and a few weeks later he was a National champion.


He managed to scrape the money together to travel to Milan for the European Championship, slept on a public garden on the first night... and reached the finals. Since then he hasn't done as well, but maybe today he'll be back to Top 8.


### Game 1


The first one to blink was Nils with a turn three [Pulse of the Forge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Forge) to the dome. On the following turn he dropped Thoren ([Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum)). David flashed [Tel-Jilad Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Justice).


David: "I'm going to do some scrying."  

Nils: "I like Scrying a lot."  

David: "Me too."


Out went Thoren and in came a [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman). Vermehren upped the ante with [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger). David played his own Thoren but an [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) and a [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) later he had no blockers.


The Slogger lumbered accross the table to hit him. Montreuil used [Journey of Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+of+Discovery) to find his second [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and played another [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman). The Slogger shot it out of the way, before slapping David around again.


David: "Cards in hand?"  

Nils: "Three."  

David: "Boy, this sucks."


He played [Death Cloud](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) for one. The Slogger shot him.


David: "Damn it, I forgot to do something important. I suck. That was very sucessfull."


Whatever it was, it probably wasn't ver relevant. Nils used [Pulse of the Forge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Forge) and [Beacon of Destruction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Destruction) to finish the game on the following turn.


Nils 1-0 David.


### Game 2


Nils had to mulligan but still fired out a first turn [Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions). David started with a turn three Troll Astetic, not the kind of thing a Blue-Red deck wants to see. He cheered.


On the following turned he played another one.


Nils: "That's not good."  

David: "I'll cheer again, then."


Vermehren battled on using a bubble to find his fifth land and unloaded [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger). David dropped one of his wacky lizard tokens on [*Mirrodin*'s Core](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrodin%27s+Core) and sat back.


He used [Shattered Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattered+Dreams) and murmured something about "another [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger)". His Trolls attacked and the Slogger slowed one of them down. [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) came in to bring back the [Shattered Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattered+Dreams).


The second [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger) entered the fray, but David was in an attacking mood. He sent the whole crew in. This time he didn't save the blocked Troll. That heralded [Death Cloud](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud). He did indeed play it, for four.


They played "draw go" for a while until Nils played [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), followed by [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum). Montreuil found land after land until he topdecked his own Thoren.


Vermehren kept digging away with another Thirst and [Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) looking for a way out. He was at a mere one life from the Cloud. He found nothing and decided to hide behind Thoren. David attacked, and they traded. Then the former Swiss National Champion revealed another [Death Cloud](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud).


Nils 1-1 David.


### Game 3


Nils took a few seconds to resolve the scry on his first turn [Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) and David was just too curious. He played [Shattered Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattered+Dreams) to get rid of Wand the Elements.


David: "I'll play [Journey of Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+of+Discovery) and let you Thirst."  

Nils: "Ok, I'll Thirst."


He used it to find [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) and reach the magic five mana. [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) got rid of the artifact but Vermehren had another one.


David: "Mr. Slug?"  

Nils: "Mr. Slug!"


Molder did indeed join the fray and the second Thoren was soon gone. [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) took out the Shaman and [Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) let Nils shove some cards to the bottom of the deck.


He then played a THIRD [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum). Montreuil played [Journey of Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+of+Discovery) and used the extra [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) to power out Troll Astetic. Nils was in trouble.


Not only could he not easily handle the big Slug but the Troll was untouchable. David used [Shattered Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattered+Dreams) to take a peek.


David: "So you do have a Pulse."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpzur04/fm4_2.jpg)He took another [Wand of the Elements](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wand+of+the+Elements) and attacked. His [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) brought back [Journey of Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+of+Discovery). The Pulse evened the score a bit but Nils was basically just playing lands at this point, trying to maximize his Pulse.


Confidently the Canadian-turned-Swiss sent his crew in. Nils stared at the life totals. Finally he blinked: [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) took the Witness out and he fell to six.


David: "I'll Death Could for six."


Nils extended his hand.


Final Result:  

David 2-1 Nils.
