As mentioned earlier, a victory for Yuuya Watanabe here will cement him as the greatest Grand Prix master to have ever existed in the game's history. A win here will mark Watanabe's 7th victory, tying him with the legendary Kai Budde.


Sherwin Pu was not about to go down without a fight and seems to be in a favorable position. After all, his Boros Burn deck has been wrecking havoc in Beijing all weekend and Mono Black Devotion should have been within his metagame projection.


**Game One**


Pu was ready with [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) to deal with Watanabe's [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) before we could see it multiply. [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood) seemed like the perfect answer to [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie).


[Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) would prove to be problematic since it was difficult to remove without [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks). Pu took one hit, going to 14, but an end of turn [Warleader's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warleader%27s+Helix) restored his life to 18.


Watanabe presented [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), causing Pu to exclaim with mid amusement, "wow, maindeck!" It removed [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack), paving the way for any future Gray Merchants of Asphodel.


Watanabe had no intent of winning that way though, as he activated both his [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and charged into the red zone along with the demon, reducing Pu from 18 to 8 in one fell swoop. When Pu tried to tap down [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) by sacrificing [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), Watanabe put an end to that plan using [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall).


Since Watanabe was at 9 life himself, he declined to attack with [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), because his opponent's [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood) would potentially put him in danger zone. Playing it safe, he decided to spend two turns attacking with [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) instead.

*Yuuya Watanabe does the math and plays it safe to win Game One.*
 


**Sherwin Pu 0 – Yuuya Watanabe 1**


 


**Game Two**


Pu opened with [Firedrinker Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firedrinker+Satyr) and delivered a single punch before [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) sent it to the gallows. [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) seemed like a good replacement and Watanabe's life was dripping away, two by two.


Watanabe wasted no time using double [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) to relieve him of [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) and [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks), paving the way for Watanabe's [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon). However, Pu savagely ripped a replacement off the top, locking away the 6/6 flyer.


Watanabe cushioned his life total with a pair of [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), but without other permanents in play, that only gained him a measly 6 life. Twelve life was not a lot when the duo of [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) was dealing four a turn. The final kick was delivered by [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm).

Sherwin Pu rises from the ashes and wins Game Two, with the help of a pair of [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix)es.


 


**Sherwin Pu 1 – Yuuya Watanabe 1**


**Game Three**


With the tournament in its final throes, both players looked considerably tense. A Grand Prix title was at stake and every decision was crucial now. But sometimes, you don't get to to make many decisions.


Watanabe opened with Swamp, [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat).


Not having drawn any creature removal, Pu could only activate his own [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), dealing two damage.


Pu watched in horror as Watanabe made a second copy, followed by the third. [Toil & Trouble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toil+%2F%2F+Trouble) and [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) were not exactly useful in this situation.


A second [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) joined the horde and Watanabe could taste victory.
