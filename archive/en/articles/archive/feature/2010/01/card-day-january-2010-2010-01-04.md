Card of the Day - January, 2010
===============================

![Rocket-Powered Turbo Slug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rocket-Powered+Turbo+Slug)**[Rocket-Powered Turbo Slug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rocket-Powered+Turbo+Slug)** – *Unhinged* uncommon. This card got into *Unhinged* after it got rejected from *Unglued* for rules concerns. Three years later, *Future Sight*'s [Pact Cycle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5Bpact%5D&set=%7C%5B%22Future%20Sight%22%5D) would put it into real **Magic** at last.
 ![Rishadan Airship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rishadan+Airship)**[Rishadan Airship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Airship)** – *Mercadian Masques* common. [Rishadan Airship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Airship) is cool for two reasons. First, it appeared as a four-of in the Top 8 of Pro Tour–Chicago 2000 in Jay Elarar's mono-blue deck. Second, c'mon, *airship pirates*. You can't beat that.
 ![Goblin Rock Sled](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Rock+Sled)**[Goblin Rock Sled](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rock+Sled)** – *Fourth Edition* common. As part of the Great Creature Type Update, [Goblin Rock Sled](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rock+Sled) was officially changed from creature type "Rock Sled" (or "Rock-Sled") to "Goblin". Which means that it no longer has to wait for a Rock Sled King to be printed in order for it to get +1/+1!
 ![Living Plane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Living+Plane)**[Living Plane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Plane)** – *Legends* rare. The roots of *Worldwake* stretch all the way back to *Legends*. After all, what is a [Living Plane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Plane) but a world where the lands come to life and try to kill you?
 ![Trained Pronghorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Trained+Pronghorn)**[Trained Pronghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trained+Pronghorn)** – *Judgment* common. The jump displayed in [Trained Pronghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trained+Pronghorn) is a "pronk", a characteristic vertical leap performed by the gazelles and antelopes. It's also called "stotting".
 ![Ethercaste Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ethercaste+Knight)**[Ethercaste Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethercaste+Knight)** – *Alara Reborn* common. After the shards (of Alara) merged, different residents reacted differently to the new environment. The [Ethercaste Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethercaste+Knight)s, originally of Bant, welcomed their new Esper neighbors with open arms. Arms which, if you look closely at the art, they replaced with Etherium!
 ![Merchant Ship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Merchant+Ship)**[Merchant Ship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Ship)** – *Arabian Nights* uncommon. [Merchant Ship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Ship) was the Card of the Day on [June 4, 2007](/en/articles/archive/card-day-june-2007-2007-06-01), when it kicked off one of the greatest week-long themes that Card of the Day has ever had: five straight "ship" cards, all illustrated by Tom Wänerstrand!
 ![Priest of Gix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Priest+of+Gix)**[Priest of Gix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Gix)** – *Urza's Saga* uncommon. [Priest of Gix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Gix) is one of many cards that got a little stronger and safer to use after the ***Magic** 2010* rules changes and the removal of mana burn. Also on this list are [Upwelling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upwelling), which seems to have inspired [a card in *Worldwake*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/74), and [Mana Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Drain), which we hear was pretty good to begin with.
 ![Common Courtesy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Common+Courtesy)**[Common Courtesy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Common+Courtesy)** – *Unglued* uncommon. The word "**Magic**" in the flavor text of [Common Courtesy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Common+Courtesy) is bolded, to conform to our stylistic rules. That joke was mostly for our editors, really.
 ![Noble Vestige](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Noble+Vestige)**[Noble Vestige](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Vestige)** – *Zendikar* common. Most people don't think about the problems faced by a ghost in a world where the terrain is constantly changing. Just imagine if you were haunting a castle that now only exists as pieces of architecture floating in the clouds. It seems like it would be disconcerting.
 ![Weakstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Weakstone)**[Weakstone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weakstone)** – *Antiquities* uncommon. The stone in [Weakstone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weakstone) is clearly that green thing right there. It's easy to see. But it's hard to focus on, because the weird dog thing wearing the collar is so adorable! It also appears on the alternate art of [Circle of Protection: Art](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Art), as you can see [here](/en/articles/archive/hidden-unhinged-jokes-2008-02-11).
 ![View from Above](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=View+from+Above)**[View from Above](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=View+from+Above)** – *Conflux* uncommon. Did you know that the Vedalken in the foreground of [View from Above](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=View+from+Above) is flying? Well, it is! It's looking down at the land of Grixis from above the clouds. And it's presumably wondering how to get back home to Esper.
 ![Presence of the Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Presence+of+the+Master)**[Presence of the Master](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Presence+of+the+Master)** – *Legends* uncommon. The guy who look suspiciously like Albert Einstein isn't the only reference to the real world on [Presence of the Master](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Presence+of+the+Master). The ring of planets has a red planet at number four and a ringed planet at number six, making them probably Mars and Saturn. But what's with the *tenth* planet?
 ![Wake of Vultures](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wake+of+Vultures)**[Wake of Vultures](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wake+of+Vultures)** – *Visions* common. [Wake of Vultures](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wake+of+Vultures) got promoted from "Creature–Vulture" to "Creature–Bird" in the Great Creature Type Update. This change also meant that [Soraya the Falconer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soraya+the+Falconer) gives it a bonus. "Soraya the Vulturer" doesn't have the same ring to it.
 ![World-Bottling Kit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=World-Bottling+Kit)**[World-Bottling Kit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World-Bottling+Kit)** – *Unhinged* rare. This *Unhinged* card is a reference to [Apocalypse Chime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Apocalypse+Chime), [City in a Bottle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+in+a+Bottle), and [Golgothian Sylex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgothian+Sylex). Mark Rosewater tried very hard to get it into *Mirrodin*, but eventually gave up and saved it for an *Un-*set.
 ![Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dread)**[Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread)** – *Lorwyn* rare. Do you wonder exactly what you're looking like when you see [Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread) (or one of the other [Elemental Incarnations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Elemental%22%5D+%5B%22Incarnation%22%5D) from *Lorwyn*)? Here's a quote from the art description: "Notes: Incarnation cycle. Get weird with this! Players shouldn't be able to look at this and say, 'oh, it's a snail.' It should be much stranger than that." That's as specific as we can get!
 ![Citanul Woodreaders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Citanul+Woodreaders)**[Citanul Woodreaders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citanul+Woodreaders)** – *Planar Chaos* common. You might not have realized it, but "Citanul" is a common English word spelled backwards. This explains why we spent an hour trying to write this blurb as a palindrome. Trying and *failing*, we should say. If you're curious, it was going to end with "Ow! Lunatic!"
 ![Shriek of Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shriek+of+Dread)**[Shriek of Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriek+of+Dread)** – *Planeshift* common. The creature giving the titular shriek in [Shriek of Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriek+of+Dread) is [Crosis, the Purger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crosis%2C+the+Purger), who is easily recognizable by means of comparing the two cards. Or by reading the flavor text.
 ![Dread Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dread+Charge)**[Dread Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Charge)** – *Portal* rare. Fittingly, the *Portal* card [Dread Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Charge) nearly gives Fear. Why doesn't go all the way and allow artifact creatures to block? Simple: *Portal* didn't have any artifacts, so it would have been confusing to print it on a product designed for new players!
 ![Dread Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dread+Return)**[Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return)** – *Time Spiral* uncommon. If you look carefully at the art for [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return), you might recognize a creature that would benefit from being sacrificed and returned to the battlefield: [Mindslicer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslicer)!
