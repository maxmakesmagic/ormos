Here at Community Spotlight, we're always on the lookout for the latest news in the world of gaming. What's got gamers talking? And that means we monitor forums and websites almost obsessively. Because that's where the gaming conversation takes place in this wondrous world of the far future.


But this weekend, people are gathering face to face in Indianapolis, IN. We refer, of course, to [Gen Con Indy](http://www.gencon.com/2010/indy/default.aspx), which we're told is The Best Four Days In Gaming!


So we dispatched Ace Reporter Monty Ashley to report live from the scene. He's been on the case for a day already and he's got [the scoop on Thursday](/en/events/coverage/gen-con-2010). Over the next three days, expect to see many more pictures and reports, including brief glimpses of the Vintage, Legacy, and *Zendikar* Block Championships and the Uktabi Kong event created by [**Magic** Community Labs](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/508). This is only an overview of the whole **Magic** experience at Gen Con; Nate Price will have full coverage of the Vintage and Legacy Championships later. As soon as we get all those delicious decklists typed up!
