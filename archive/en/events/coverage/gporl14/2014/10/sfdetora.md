Sultai against Temur was the matchup for this semifinal, with two longtime players battling to reach the last match of the weekend. Malka is a Grand Prix champion from as long ago as 2002, while DeTora is looking to add a little bit of history to her career by adding a GP title to the GP and Pro Tour Top 8s she already holds.



**Game 1**




 Melissa had [Temur Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Ascendancy) online turn, but that does very little against two [Rakshasa's Secret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa%27s+Secret) – maybe that's what [Rakshasa's Secret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa%27s+Secret) is... With apparently very little action happening on board, Malka had four cards in hand to DeTora's zero. Of the many things that you don't want to be facing when you have no cards in hand, [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) is probably quite high on the list. Then again, it's probably quite high on the list of cards you don't want to face even if you do have cards in hand. In as brutal a game one as we've seen all weekend, Sol Malka took the lead.




**DeTora 0 – 1 Malka**




**Game 2**




 Having seen her hand torn to shreds in game one, DeTora was all about the card advantage in game two, with a turn five [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) fired off to keep her hand well stocked. That led to [Tusked Colossodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tusked+Colossodon), and a hand well poised to make it stick. The deal with discard and disruption is that, if you do it enough, you can basically win with anything that has an even vaguely respectable combination of power and toughness. If, on the other hand, you're left with just vaguely reasonable etc, it usually isn't enough, and DeTora's Power – as in the quarterfinals against Ian Farnung – was enough this time around.
