We are now one vote away from completing the second "You Make the Card." All that's left is selecting flavor text. After pouring through over 4600 entries, the Creative Text team narrowed down the submissions to the following ten entries (in the order they were received):

> 
> 
> *Amidst the darkest ashes grow the strongest seeds.*
> 
>

The final vote is going to be a quick one as the set is just a week away from being finalized. This means the deadline for this vote will be noon (PST) this Friday (October 31).


I think there are many good options to chose from so I'm interested to see what you all pick.


Have fun!


Mark
