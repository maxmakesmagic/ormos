### **NASS, WILSON, AND HAMPTON HIT THE HIGH NOTE**


Matthew Nass, Jacon WIlson, and Jesse Hampton blasted past Tom Martell, Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, and Shahar Shenhar to claim the team title at Grand Prix Nashville.

TOP 4 COVERAGE
--------------


Young heroes wrote a new song in Nashville, where Jesse Hampton, Matthew Nass, and 19th-ranked Jacob Wilson took home a team Grand Prix title from one of the greatest Top 4s of all time.


While 464 teams comprised of 1,392 players arrived before being winnowed to just 43 teams for Sunday, it was the Top 4 that stole the show: Five players from the upcoming World Championship in Nice, France were on teams that made the Top 4, and four of them made it to the finals. While the renown all-star team of 18th-ranked Tom Martell, Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, and 20th-ranked Shahar Shenhar didn't find success in their finals showdown, they'll be ready to avenge their loss to Wilson's team soon in France.


For Hampton, this was his biggest victory since earning a Pro Tour Top 8 in Philadelphia in 2011. For Nass, it's his second Grand Prix win to join his first from Oakland in 2010. Neither will join their third at Worlds Week, but together they've ensured their spots at Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* early next year.


They may not be teammates for the upcoming Pro Tour, but as one in Nashville it was proof that camaraderie is truly key to a team's success.

DAY 2 COVERAGE
--------------


Many came; few remain. Only forty-three teams were invited back to play in Khans of Tarkir Team Sealed. And only one team remains undefeated.


The squad of Matthew Sommerhalter, Dewitt Kane, and Riley Curran finished 9-0, ahead of a lot of teams, and a lot of teams featuring some big names. They range from teams like Grand Prix Portland finalists No. 11 Eric Froehlich, Luis Scott-Vargas, and Paul Cheon, to old-school teams like Jon Finkel, Jamie Parke, and Daniel O’Mahoney-Schwartz, with dozens in between.


The Top 4 team drafts are a few short rounds away. Who will earn the right to draft for Grand Prix glory? We’ll find out. Follow the live coverage and watch stream broadcasting the second batch of Team Sealed matches to learn along with us.

DAY 1 COVERAGE
--------------


Ladies and gentlemen, that was a day of *Magic*! *Khans of Tarkir* Team Sealed has been declared an incredibly skill-testing, and incredibly fun format. Players from all over have converged in Nashville for not only a day slinging cardboard with their friends, but to play in some of the best draft formats around.


At the end of the first day, only one team emerged undefeated. Matthew Sommerhalter, Dewitt Kane, and Riley Curran finished 9-0 atop of field of giants. But plenty of top teams are coming back tomorrow to challenge their crown: No. 7 Ari Lax, Matt McCullough, and Alex John; No. 17 Alex Hayne, Craig Wescoe and Frank Skarren; No. 18 Tom Martell, No. 20 Shahar Shenhar, and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa; No. 14 Josh Utter-Leyton, Josh Cho, and Gerry Thompson; No. 13 Ben Stark, Niel Reeves, and Chris Fennell are all in, along with a whole host of other hungry competitors.


There were a few surprises too. Though Grand Prix Portland Team Sealed finalists No. 11 Eric Froehlich, Luis Scott-Vargas, and Paul Cheon made it into Day 2, returning champions, and highest-combined-rank team No. 1 Owen Turtenwald, No. 4 Reid Duke, and No. 9 William Jensen failed to win their final round to advance. Their Peach Garden Oath though unbroken, has been bent.


Sommerhalter, Kane, and Curran are the team to beat. And though they’re looking down on everyone from the top, we’ve all seen the mighty fall before. Can they hold on to the lead? We’ll find out bright and early tomorrow (though not quite as early, thanks to Daylight Savings Time).


See you then!
