**What is Your Favorite Thing about Standard Right Now?**



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpchi14/ParkeQQ.jpg)***Jamie Parke:** Right now, Standard is fairly well solved, which I actually dislike a little. To me, *Magic* is a game much like chess, where you want to be able to plan out your future turns as much as you can. That's why I really like the black cards like [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie), which let you look at your opponents' hands. Having the information that they provide is amazing. I guess I'd say the cards that let you plan out your strategy are my favorite part of Standard right now.* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpchi14/LaxQQ.jpg)***Ari Lax:** I think that the power level of all of the decks in Standard is very close to even. They have roughly the same number of very powerful cards and the same number of average cards, so the games tend to be a little more back-and-forth than you are used to seeing in other formats. Most of the matches are fairly close to 50/50, with very few exceptions. Like you're not playing [Firedrinker Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firedrinker+Satyr) and expecting to beat [Frostburn Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird), and you're not playing [Gladecover Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gladecover+Scout) and expecting to beat [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict). Other than that small number of matchups, though, Standard is a very even playing field at the moment.* 



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpchi14/SullivanQQ.jpg)***Adrian Sullivan:** My favorite part of Standard right now is that, regardless of which deck you play, you are always going to be faced with some very intricate decisions. Even the decks that seem like they wouldn't be the kind to be very thoughtful decks result in some very interesting decision trees.*
