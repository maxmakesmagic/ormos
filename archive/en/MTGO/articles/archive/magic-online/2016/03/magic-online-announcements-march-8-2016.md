**Reminder: No Downtime on March 16**


In an effort to make sure *Magic Online* is available when you want to play *Magic*, we’re working on ways to reduce the number of times we have to bring the system offline for maintenance. As a first step we’re simply going to eliminate at least one downtime each month.


Here are the dates of the exact downtimes we’ll be skipping in the first half of 2016:


* March 16
* April 6
* May 11
* June 8
* June 22

During these weeks without a downtime, *Magic Online* will NOT be processing set redemptions. **This means that if you're thinking about redemption, please submit your order before the March 9 downtime if you want your order processed before March 16.** If your order isn't made prior to the March 9 downtime, it won't be processed until March 23.


Additionally, the April 20 downtime that we were skipping is back on due to a system refresh that needs to take place.

**Downtime for March 9, 2016**


* All tournaments will close Wednesday, March 9, at 5:00 a.m. PT (13:00 UTC)
* Store and trade activity will be suspended at approximately 7:45 a.m. PT (15:45 UTC)
* The system will be down from 8:00 a.m. PT (16:00 UTC) until 12:00 p.m. PT (20:00 UTC)
