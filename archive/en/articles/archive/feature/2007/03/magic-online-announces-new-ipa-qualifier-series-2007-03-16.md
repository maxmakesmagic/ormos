How does playing with and competing for *Invasion*/*Planeshift*/*Apocalypse* on Wizards' dime sound? On April 7 and April 8, hundreds of **Magic**
*Online* players in two different championship events will be doing exactly that! Over the next two weeks, **Magic**
*Online* will be hosting a series of *sixty-four* IPA Qualifier events, featuring both Limited and Constructed formats. The Top 8 players from every single one of those events will win invitations to one of two different Invasion/Planeshift/Apocalypse Sealed Deck tournament, where they will get to compete *for free* (including the sealed product to build your deck) to win coveted *Invastion*/*Planeshift*/*Apocalypse* booster packs. 

As if that's not enough, all participants in the qualifier events will receive a [Hazezon Tamar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazezon+Tamar) online promo card, while the Top 8 from each qualifier will receive a *premium* version of the [Hazezon Tamar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazezon+Tamar) online promo card. 

So come join us for two weeks of competition in the 2nd 2007 IPA QT series on **Magic**
*Online*. While I won’t go as far as saying this will be that last IPA event we’ll run on **Magic**
*Online* 2, with **Magic**
*Online* 3 in beta, there is a good chance that this is, in fact, the last IPA QT series on the v2 platform.
