Welcome to the Double Feature! This special draft format combines the fierce wolves of *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* with the aristocratic vampires of *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* for twice the monstrous fun! Packs will contain cards from both sets, letting you combine your favorite cards and themes from across Innistrad. We've even raised the stakes by including ***two rares in every pack***, one from each set!


In addition, every entry to Double Feature comes with a Dracula card style, so your decks will have an extra-classical feel. Don't miss this chance to get all dressed up! (Note that silver screen treatments from tabletop *Innistrad: Double Feature* will not appear on *MTG Arena*.)


**Dates**: January 28, 8 a.m. PT, until February 10, 8 a.m. PT


**Format**: Ranked player draft with three Double Feature packs; each pack contains cards from both *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* and *Innistrad: Crimson Vow*, including a rare from each set.


**Structure**: 7 wins or 3 losses in Best-of-One matches


**Entry**: 10,000 gold or 1,500 gems or a Player Draft Token


**Rewards**:
