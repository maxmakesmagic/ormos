It's a Javier mirror match at 7-0. On once side, Javier Luna of Argentina, a former Worlds team member, playing Black-Green Devotion. His deck keys off the constellation abilities of [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms) and [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant), and goes big with [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) and [See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten). Opposite him sits Javier Osorio of Chile, playing an Abzan Midrange deck directly descended from those seen at Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*. Using the same skeleton of [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), his deck plays a long game of incremental advantages.


The Games
=========


Luna led out with a pair of [Llanowar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Wastes) but had no play on them. Osorio scried with [Temple of Malady](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Malady), then [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)d Luna on the following turn. He saw a hand of two [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant)s, [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen), [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx). He took the Courser and left Luna with his expensive spells.

Osorio looked to get ahead with his own [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). Luna went one better, summoning [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms) and getting a free card. Osorio was unable to remove it and watched as Luna summoned a parade of enchantment-creatures while keeping a full grip. He tried to keep up with [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) to draw two and a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) to stop [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) from hitting play. Luna continued to attack, summoning a second [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant).



Osorio had to put a stop to it. At end of turn he gave the [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms) two +1/+1 counters with [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm), then untapped and dropped Elspeth to sweep away all the big creatures, leaving just the Courser behind. It was a big play, but Luna still had gas in the tank. He attacked Elspeth with his own Courser, forcing a block, then summoned Doomwake giant and another Courser to finish off Osorio's. Osorio shored up his defenses with Elspeth tokens and [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor). [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) took care of the [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant). That was three of them gone.

Luna was unperturbed. He tapped five for [Arbor Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus) and then used Nykthos to power out [See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten), getting [Pharika, God of Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%2C+God+of+Affliction) and [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater). Osario was in trouble and dug for answers with [Read the Bones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones). He managed to find a [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) for Polukranos, but could only watch helplessly as a second [See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten) served up [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant) and [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms). That cleared out all his tokens and left his Planeswalkers utterly exposed. Seeing his empire crumble, Osorio scooped to move to game two.



**Luna 1 - Osorio 0**


Osorio led out with a pair of painlands. Luna scryed and then summoned


[Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid). Osorio [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)d and stole [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) from Luna, leaving behind [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen), [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), and [See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten). However, Osorio had no third land. Luna untapped and played the Courser, rewarded with a free land waiting on top of his library. Osorio simply drew and passed. It looked like Luna would run away with things.


However, Luna's hand was a little slow. He got another free land, attacked for two and summoned a second Caryatid. Osorio drew his next card slowly, then peeked at [Windswept Heath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath). That got him a forest, but he simply passed with his mana open. Luna fetched to get a second look with his Courser and found Nykthos, which powered out [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen).

Osorio had been waiting for this. He cast [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow), sweeping away the fliers. Luna hit again with his Courser and summoned a second [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen). Osorio had a second [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow), and drew a scryland to make it even sweeter, setting up a fifth land on his deck.



Unfortunately for Luna, he decided to throw caution to the wind here and summon both a second [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and Polukranos. Osorio was only too happy to untap and show him [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities). Luna slumped in his seat. Still, Osorio needed to mount an offence. [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms) got Luna only a single card before falling to [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut), and Osorio started to summon [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s.


Luna cast [See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten) and got himself a Polukranos. That supercharged the second [See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten), which got him Pharika and a lowly [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic). His graveyard was packed. However Osorio wasn't done yet. He had the one card he needed: [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End) to exile the indestructible God before Luna could get more than a single Snake. He then added [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker) to his squad and started to animate lands. He took down Polukranos with another [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut) and sacrified one of his Rhinos to clear out the Snake.


Luna was running out of time. His board of [Voyaging Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr)s and Caryatids was not going to get the job done. Empty-handed, he drew [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant), still short of victory. Osorio held back on three animated 4/4 lands. Luna drew and then started counting mana. Nykthos and two Satyrs can mean a LOT of mana, and it seemed like he was counting to a very high number. The reason? A topdecked Pharika. He made three Snakes and Osorio was dismayed to learn that they were indeed enchantment creatuers. In a game full of crazy swings, that was the backbreaker.


**Javier Luna defeats Javier Osorio 2-0**
