Yet another constructed Pro Tour and yet another great showing from Your Move Games. Store owner Rob Dougherty had his break-out performance way back at PT new York '99 when his Utility Belt deck broke the Urza-block constructed format wide open. His Benzo deck put two teammates into the Top 8 in New Orleans – the most recent Extended-format PT – and he's been using the same basic design to great effect here in Houston. Dougherty was 7-1-1 when he sat down for a round 10 feature match against Swede Mattias Jorstedt, who was also 7-1-1, running Team Punisher's [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) deck.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop02/a913.jpg)Dougherty's turn 1 [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) showed him that Jorstedt had every piece of his combo except the [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)-able one: four lands, [Cavern Harpy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+Harpy), [Wirewood Savage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Savage), and also a [Raven Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raven+Familiar) with which to go digging for [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren). Dougherty had no second land, but he did have an [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb), which he used to bury a [Petradon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petradon). Still operating off just one land on his third turn, Dougherty [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)d his [Petradon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petradon) and deprived Jorstedt of both his lands. Jorstedt still had enough lands and chump blockers in his hand to get his combo cranked up so Dougherty (who had drawn a second [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and a [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) by now) [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor)ed and then played out his silver bullet against [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren): [Stronghold Taskmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stronghold+Taskmaster)! Jorstedt's [Cavern Harpy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+Harpy) would now come down as a 1/0 creature and die before Jorstedt could "go off." Jorstedt couldn't find any answers and Taskmaster plus [Petradon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petradon) beatdown didn't exactly give him much time anyway. Game 1 went to Dougherty.

Between games Dougherty and Jorstedt talked about the field. Dougherty offered up that [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) had been his #2 choice. He couldn't find any way to beat a [Hatred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hatred) deck and that bothered him. Jorstedt just shrugged – he agreed that a dedicated Suicide Black would just beat him, but he didn't think there would be enough of those to make [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) a bad choice. Mostly Jorsedt's mind was still on game 1 – wishing he had played the [Living Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) he drew on turn 2 immediately to go fetch a [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake). Instead he played a [Hickory Woodlot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hickory+Woodlot) (which comes into play tapped), Dougherty brought out the [Petradon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petradon), and then Dougherty [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed away the Wish before he got back to 2 mana again.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a589.jpg)Dougherty kept attacking Jorstedt's hand in game 2: [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) let him play [Last Rites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Rites) for 4 on turn 2, taking away every spell in the Swede's hand. Dougherty got back the [Nether Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Spirit) he had discarded to [Last Rites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Rites) on his turn 3 and also added a [Phyrexian Negator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Negator) to his board, followed by an [Engineered Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) set to "beasts" on his next turn. Essentially, Dougherty transformed his deck after sideboarding into a suicide black deck quite similar to the test decks that he had never been able to beat with [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren). Jorstedt top-decked a couple [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)s, but he was unable to find anyway to deal with either the Plague or Dougherty's beatdown.

**Final Result:** Dougherty – 2, Jorstedt - 0
