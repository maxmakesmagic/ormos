The is one primary question that everyone is thinking about going into the final week of the Vintage Super League regular season: Can David Williams escape last? Sure, the seedings for the Top 4 playoff are also on the line, but we already know which four players will be playing so that doesn’t feel nearly as dramatic. What feels dramatic is that if David loses, he is out of season 3. If David wins then there will be a tie for last involving somewhere between 2 and 6 players. If you watched last season you know what ties mean: more *Magic*!

The way the pairings worked out, none of the five players at 3-5 are paired against each other. In other words, every single match this week features one player who can clinch “not last” by winning their match, but risks falling into a relegation tiebreaker if they lose. The key match will be the last match of the night: longtime close friends David and Bob wrap up the season with David’s elimination match. Note that there is guaranteed to be a tie for last if Dave wins, because at a minimum that will mean that Bob has lost … if every other 3-5 player wins then Bob and Dave actually just play again (though with different decks and on a different show).

Speaking of David having his back against the wall, you will not believe what he pulled off last week against Rich Shay in order to stay alive and create all of this week’s drama. Skip ahead to the [8:15 mark](https://youtu.be/qyA5OGAPNeo?t=8m15s) to watch the truly crazy game, but the first 8 minutes are also worth watching if you want more context about the decks and the cards they are playing.

Meanwhile, at the top of the standings we know the four playoff participants are Eric, Luis, Chris, and Randy, but we do not know the order. In fact, every single permutation of seeds is still possible at this stage, depending on who winds up tied with whom after this week’s matches. Randy does not control his own destiny for the #1 seed, but everyone else does. Since the playoff format features a bye into the finals for the #1 seed coming out of the regular season (and a bye into the semis for 2nd place), the stakes are actually pretty high even if the drama might not be. Once again, all ties will be broken by playoff games.
