GRAND PRIX MINNEAPOLIS 2016
---------------------------




* [DAY 1 COVERAGE](#tabs-0)


DAY 1 COVERAGE



This morning, 1530 hopeful planeswalkers arrived in Minneapolis with dreams of hoisting a trophy in the air. The players battled their way through nine rounds of Standard and only those with the best records earned the right to return tomorrow for another six rounds of Standard before we cut to the Top 8 elimination rounds. Four players emerged from Day 1 with undefeated records: (18) Yuuya Watanabe, Max McVety, Paul Dean, and Matt Severa lead the pack as we enter the second day of competition.


Standard continues to present a diverse and evolving landscape that keeps players on their toes. Red-Green Ramp strategies seemed to be climbing the standings throughout the day, but Bant Humans is definitely the breakout deck of the weekend at this point in time. Will Bant Humans continue its rise to dominance? Or will another deck rise to the occasion? Stay tuned to continuing coverage of Grand Prix Minneapolis for all the action as it unfolds.
