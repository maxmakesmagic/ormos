**The Community Cup is This Weekend!**


The Community Cup is this weekend! If you haven't already seen the schedule of Community Cup events, head over to DailyMTG and check them out. Plus, stop back by DailyMTG later in the week for interviews with the Community Team.


Tune into [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) at 10:00 a.m. Pacific (UTC -7) on Saturday, September 19 for the start of Community Cup festivities!


In long-standing Community Cup tradition, all *Magic Online* players will receive a prize at the event's conclusion—the catch is that it will be different depending on which team wins!


If the Wizards Team wins (which they totally will), players who logged in during Community Cup weekend—September 19 and 20—will be getting a non-premium [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow).
