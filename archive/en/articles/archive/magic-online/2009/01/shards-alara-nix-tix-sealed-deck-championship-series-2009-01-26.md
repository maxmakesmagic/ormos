The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that adult has purchased.

	* The event will re-created and start over from the beginning. Results from the previous event will not be carried over. If the event is still in its Swiss Rounds though not the final Swiss round and has been running for more than 2 hours:
