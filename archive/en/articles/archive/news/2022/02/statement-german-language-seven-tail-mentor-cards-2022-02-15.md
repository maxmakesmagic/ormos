It has come to our attention that the German-language printed and digital versions of the Seven-Tail Mentor cards from *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* are missing the dies trigger rules text. Players on *Magic: The Gathering Arena* using the German-language version of the card will still get the dies trigger even though the card doesn't mention it.


The missing rules text will be visible on *Magic: The Gathering Arena* in the coming weeks.
