----------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gp_lg.gif)After a whirlwind second day that saw three drafts and nine rounds completed in fourteen hours, Tobey Tamber has conquered his opposition to be crowned Champion of Grand Prix Kaohsiung. He met fellow Taiwan resident Tzu Ching Kuo in the finals, one of the few all-local finishes in Asian Grand Prix history. Tamber walks away from this victory $2400 richer.
