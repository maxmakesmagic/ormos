Striking and unique art is at the forefront of the *Secret Lair Drop Series*, and this drop is no exception. So, let's take a closer look at each stunning piece and the art direction that helped these talented artists do justice to the King of Monsters.


![SL2 Godzilla Plains](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/tIwijsvHSr.jpg)


**Color**: Land associated with white mana  
**Location**: Grassy plains  
**Action**: Show a wide, beautiful landscape shot of low, rolling hills covered in lush, golden grasses. Somewhere in the scene we see two giant monsters racing across the hills toward some unknown destination: Godzilla, King of the Monsters, and Mothra, a giant, benevolent, and beautiful moth. Maybe as an Easter egg, somewhere in the scene we see the Mothra Twins, two tiny fairies, singing to Mothra—they might just be resting on a hill or hovering above the grass somewhere; they don't need to be very large or focal at all.  
**Focus**: The plains landscape  
**Mood**: Rolling, lush, beautiful


![SL2 Godzilla Island](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/v7VvKd4N9o.jpg)


**Color**: Land associated with blue mana  
**Location**: Island or coastline area  
**Action**: Give a wide, beautiful landscape shot of an island or coastline area filled with unique natural rock formations. Somewhere in the scene we see Godzilla, King of the Monsters, who's surfaced abruptly from the seas, roaring, causing the waters to churn up in huge waves that crash over the shores.  
**Focus**: The island or coastline  
**Mood**: A beautiful place being drowned in waves


![SL2 Godzilla Swamp](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/ZnX4YhuKmV.jpg)


**Color**: Land associated with black mana  
**Location**: Swamp  
**Action**: Show a wide landscape shot of a gloomy, mysterious swamp. In the distance, a battle is raging between two giant monsters: Godzilla, King of the Monsters, and Hedorah, a sludge-like swamp monster with green kelp-like surfaces and vertically oriented yellow eyes with red irises. Hedorah lunges at Godzilla, who attempts to bite and slash it, and it's not clear who would win the fight.  
**Focus**: The swamp landscape  
**Mood**: A mysterious, murky swamp that hides many secrets


![SL2 Godzilla Mountain](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/POGc9oCmSd.jpg)


**Color**: Land associated with red mana  
**Location**: Mountains  
**Action**: Show a shot of a steep, jagged mountain with what looks like a huge crater gouged out of its side. Rearing up from that crater is Rodan, a winged-dinosaur-like monster, and some distance away we also see Godzilla, King of the Monsters, roaring in challenge at Rodan. Neither of the two monsters should steal too much focus—the main focus should still be the mountain itself.  
**Focus**: The mountain peak  
**Mood**: Steep, treacherous, dangerous


![SL2 Godzilla Forest](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/vOdkoiRC5q.jpg)


**Color**: Land associated with green mana  
**Location**: Forest  
**Action**: Show a lush, densely grown prehistoric forest, full of towering trees and giant ferns. Somewhere in the scene we see Godzilla, King of the Monsters, crashing through the undergrowth and ripping trees apart—he's on a rampage and is leaving destruction in his wake.  
**Focus**: The forest landscape  
**Mood**: A lush, prehistoric forest


SHIPPING
========


Similar to other *Secret Lair* drops, we want to make sure you can get this drop if you want it. Purchase within the 24-hour window and the King of Monsters will soon be making his presence felt in your decks.


Unlike previous *Secret Lair* drops, The Godzilla Lands are preorder only, meaning the cards will all be printed after the sale has concluded. Orders will ship as soon as inventory is available. We anticipate your drops will arrive around July, but the final timeline will depend on when our production partners are back up and running at full capacity.


We're also pleased to announce that we've expanded our shipping facilities within Europe to better serve the EU and the United Kingdom and improve the overall experience for fans around the world. To this end, we've added two new sub-stores within SecretLair.wizards to which customers will be redirected based on their location. SecretLair.wizards.com/US will serve North and South America, as well as APAC (with plans for further expansion).

* United States (domestic shipping)
* Argentina
* Australia
* Canada
* China
* Hong Kong
* Japan
* Macao
* Mexico
* New Zealand
