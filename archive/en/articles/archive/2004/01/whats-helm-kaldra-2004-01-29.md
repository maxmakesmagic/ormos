What's a "Helm of Kaldra"?

The *Darksteel* card [Shield of Kaldra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shield+of+Kaldra), which also served as *Darksteel's* prerelease card and expansion symbol, is one mysterious piece of equipment:

Like its *Mirrodin* predecessor, [Sword of Kaldra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Kaldra), it is a piece of Legendary equipment that grants some mighty abilities to the creature that wields it.


But unlike the Sword, the [Shield of Kaldra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shield+of+Kaldra) has a mysterious name sneaked into its rules text:

| --- |
| Equipment named Sword of Kaldra, Shield of Kaldra, and Helm of Kaldra are indestructible. |

But a quick review of the [*Mirrodin*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/cardlist/mirrodin) and [*Darksteel*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/cardlist/darksteel) card lists reveals that no card called "Helm of Kaldra" has ever been printed. What is *up* with that?


Is it just a flavorful addition, in case such a Helm is printed later? Could some obscure combination of existing cards create a piece of equipment by that name, right now? Could the Helm be a new, previously unknown card, to be printed at some future date (and if so, what abilities would *it* grant)?


And who is this "Kaldra," who owns, or owned, such powerful possessions?


We at Magicthegathering.com don't intend to answer these questions at this time. But who knows, perhaps you'll learn more about this Kaldra person -- or entity? -- on this site sometime soon.
