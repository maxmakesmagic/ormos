*Vanguard* cards are special over-sized **Magic** cards (3" x 5" as opposed to 2 1/2" x 3 1/2") that offer a different way to play. Each card has an instruction that acts like a personal global enchantment, plus modifications to your starting/maximum hand size (in the left-hand circle) and life total (on the right). Obviously, both players have to agree to use them before the game begins. Below is the Karn card (placed next to the [Karn, Silver Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn%2C+Silver+Golem) card for comparison).

These cards were used in several Arena seasons (starting in 1997), and were later available as part of a gift box. If you look around, you can find them at card shops and for sale online today.

Popular variants include each player randomly choosing a *Vanguard* card to play, or rotating *Vanguard* cards at determined intervals during a multiplayer game. But, of course, you can use *Vanguard* cards any way you want.

Here are the "official" rules, followed by the other seven cards from the first *Vanguard* series:

***Vanguard* Card**  
 The *Vanguardâ„¢* supplements consist of oversized cards that modify the game. A *Vanguard* card is selected before the game begins, adjusting a player's starting and maximum hand size and starting life total. Any abilities printed on a *Vanguard* card are played exactly like those of an in-play **Magic** card; however, these abilities have no color, and damage from them isn't damage from a permanent of any type or a source of any color. A *Vanguard* card isn't a **Magic** card, so it can't be affected by spells or abilities.
