The July 27, 2016 update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 27, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by the Vintage Super League not actually being a thing to watch last night. First error I've ever made in my entire life. I swear. Even if my fiancée would disagree.


Today's Must
============


1. [Commander VS: Beneath the *Eldritch Moon*](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33359_Commander-VS-Beneath-The-Eldritch-Moon.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

I've come to look forward to these videos whenever a new set releases. Sure, people can talk about what legends will be good in Commander, but the Commander Vs. crew puts their mana where their mouth is by brewing, building, and playing with the new cards. All four decks are flavorful and fun, and if you enjoy Commander, then this video is certainly a must for today.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [New Pro Tour Rules Announced for PT *Eldritch Moon*](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/new-pro-tour-rules-announced-for-pt-eldritch-moon/) | ChannelFireball | Matt Sperling

Yesterday an email went out to all Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* competitors signaling two changes to how the tournament is run—electronic decklist submissions (and an earlier deadline) and a few anti-scouting measures. The changes came out of a dialogue with a group of pros we've been working with for a few months now. Matt Sperling is one of those pros and, in this article, he details the thought process and discussion that helped lead to these new rules.


1. [Listener Questions!](https://rocketjump.com/listen/listener-questions-115) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

You questioned. They listened. Then they answered. Some of the questions. Some podcasts know how to keep things under an hour, and this hour of Commander questions answered is worth listening to.


1. [Déjà Vu](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13417&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=7-27-2016) | TCGPlayer | Seth Manfield

With the Pro Tour approaching, the World's No. 1 player has his eyes on the results from the past weekend. Last time the weeks leading up to the Pro Tour had Bant Company as the top deck—i.e. last Pro Tour—Manfield made the Top 8. Coincidence? No way to know until Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*, but I wouldn't bet against the hottest player on the planet.


1. [Melissa Li Says *Magic: The Gathering* Is Making Huge Gender Strides](http://www.theestablishment.co/2016/07/25/melissa-li-says-magic-the-gathering-is-making-huge-gender-strides/) | The Establishment | Katie Tandy

The article shifts the focus of the interview a bit from what the whole is really about, but this is a worthwhile read. It's essentially an interview with Mel Li, one of the forces behind our creative team, about life at Wizards of the Coast, making *Magic*, and, yes, gender diversity in the worlds, both real and fictional, of *Magic*.


1. [5 Odd Creature Types in *Magic: The Gathering*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PybBygGLOWY) | SeibenMTG

For all of your trivia needs.

1. [*Arena of the Planeswalkers: Shadows over Innistrad* Review](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/arena-of-the-planeswalkers-shadows-over-innistrad-review) | MTGGoldfish | Brad Minnigh

Something a little different for you board game fans. *Arena of the Planeswalkers* is a *Magic*-themed board game that recently released the *Shadows over Innistrad* expansion, complete with playable figures of Sorin, Nahiri, and both sides of Alinn Kord. Brad Minnigh reviews it, but anything that lets you replay Sorin versus Nahiri has got my vote.


Top 25
======


1. The calm before the storm

There were no tournaments that awarded Pro points this past weekend, so, appropriately, there are no changes.


But that's the last time we'll be saying this before the end of the season. This weekend features three Grand Prix, and the following weekend at Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* we'll see a bounty of points awarded, causing virtually everyone to rise and fall. By how much, of course, is up to them.


One note, next week, look for the Top 25 on Thursday rather than Wednesday, as time shifts in Australia are going to cause a few delays on our end.

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Create a token](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/148004010748/can-you-talk-about-the-changed-wording-create-a)

This came up yesterday when we revealed the Friday Night *Magic* promo version of [Rise from the Tides](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Tides) that had the phrase "Create a token," which is new terminology for putting a token into the battlefield that is making its full debut in *Kaladesh*. Mark Rosewater clarified what was going on in the post above.


Decks of the Day
================


1. White-Black Angel Control

I made mention of this deck on Monday, but it still reverberates with me as one of the coolest things to see on camera at the StarCityGames.com Open in Columbus, so I'm running with it to get it unstuck from my head.


Ronnie Ritner made the Top 8 of the event with an updated take on White-Black control that utilizes a ton of *Eldritch Moon* cards, the most exciting of which is the meld pair of [Bruna, the Fading Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bruna%2C+the+Fading+Light) and [Gisela, the Broken Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gisela%2C+the+Broken+Blade). Multiple times over the weekend we saw the pair meld into [Brisela, Voice of Nightmares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brisela%2C+Voice+of+Nightmares) and dominate the board.


But the real key might have been [Thalia's Lancers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%27s+Lancers), which allowed Ritner to tutor up the right legend for the job, including [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet), [Archangel Avacyn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn), and [Linvala, the Preserver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+the+Preserver). In fact, the deck played no non-legendary creatures beside the Lancers. It even ran one [Geier Reach Sanitarium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geier+Reach+Sanitarium) to search up if it needed a land!


Beyond that, [Liliana, the Last Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope), [Blessed Alliance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Alliance), and [Collective Brutality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality) all made appearances, giving this deck a decidedly *Eldritch Moon* flavor.


The one weakness of the deck looked to possibly be [Spell Queller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Queller) and [Reflector Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage), which make four-drop creatures look a little awkward at times. That might be helped a bit by moving [Transgress the Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind) into the main over [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), allowing you to pick either of the two ubiquitous creatures (or [Collected Company](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company)) out of your opponent's hand before melding together your awesome Eldrazi Angel.
