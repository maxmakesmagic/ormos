This week's "Sketches" takes a look at the illustration of the cycling discard spell [Unburden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburden) from *Scourge*. Wayne England was given the assignment.

### 1. Art Description

These were the instructions given to the artist:

 "Location: Interior room, Aphetto City  
 Action: Show a close-up of a victim's face with a blank stare as ooze and slime (representing the victim's knowledge) runs out of its eyes, ears and nose. The victim's head is starting to wither away. In the shadows of the background, a Cabal cleric can be watching with delight." 

### 2. Sketches

Here is Wayne's first sketch. Notice especially the [Cabal Patriarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Patriarch)-looking gent behind our foreground victim.

The main problem here is the look of the Cabal cleric. As we've seen through several [Sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches) of *Legions* and *Scourge* cards, the art team wanted to make sure to emphasize the warped, mutated forms that the major tribes took on as the *Onslaught* block wore on. In particular, the Cabal cleric in the background was too stately and dignified-looking -- too much an *Odyssey* block Cabalist (like the aforementioned [Cabal Patriarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Patriarch), who didn't even have Cleric among his creature types). Contrast this with the bloated fellows in the art of *Scourge*'s [Lingering Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Death) or [Unspeakable Symbol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unspeakable+Symbol)!

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. The Cabal cleric is now fully recognizable as a *Scourge* Cabalist; plainly, this is a guy who would enjoy watching the ichor drip from our poor victim's eyes and mouth. (Ew.)

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you can see it in booster packs.
