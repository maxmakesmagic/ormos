**![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpcha15/Top-8-Zach-Jesse.jpg)Name:** Zach Jesse


**Age:** 30


**Hometown:** Richmond, VA




**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

Several Grand Prix Top 8s. Did well at several Pro Tour but no Top 8s





**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

“Griselshoalbrand” – The deck is ridiculous. Honestly though, I played it because I wanted to have fun





**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  

Nourishing Shoul. The deck couldn’t operate without it. I also like [Worldspine Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldspine+Wurm) as nothing feels better than putting a 15/15 into play.






**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon). It’s even better when you cast it on turn 1 or 2.







**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**  

Lots of turn 2 kills. I hard cast [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) three times, twice in one game. I’ve also spliced onto Arcane more than any other time in my life. I kill my opponent in response to end step Deciever Exarch multiple times.

**Age:** 23


**Hometown:** Indianapolis, IN




**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

States 2014





**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Blue-Red Splinter twin because [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) is a busted card.






**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon). See above.







**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  

A tie between the third [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) and the first [Keranos, God of Storms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keranos%2C+God+of+Storms) simply because they’re both unfair in different ways.







**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**  
[Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) targeting [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation) to steal my opponent’s manlands in combat.

**Age**: 25


**Hometown:** Berkeley, CA




**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

Five previous Grand Prix Top 8s with one win.





**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Blue-Red [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin). They took my [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod)s away!






**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand). The card is so punishing on the play and enables from absurd tricks.







**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Mage+of+Zhalfir). No one knew what it did and it enables from sweet blowouts.







**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**  

Using Teferi to allow me to [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) away my opponent’s Rending Volley.

**Age:** 20


**Hometown:** Cut Off, LA




**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

22nd Grand Prix Las Vegas. I have a winning record versus Tom Ross.





**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Burn. Burn has a fighting change versus all the decks while being good versus Grixis decks.






**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Flame Javelin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin). It dodges [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), kills Deciever Exarch, doesn’t trigger [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel), and hits the face for 4.







**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile). And extremely tempo efficient catch-all answer.







**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**  

Cast [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) targeting my opponent.

**Age:** 24


**Hometown:** Destine, FL




**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

TCG Player Jacksonville 5k Winner  

Top 32 Grand Prix Nashville  

Day 2 Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*



**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  
[Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) Elves. It’s fantastic against the “fair” decks and after sideboarding the big mana decks (Red-Green Tron and Amulet Bloom) get reasonable.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  

Collect Company. It allows me to go over the top of everything in terms of card advantage and board presence. Honorable mention to [Ezuri, Renegade Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%2C+Renegade+Leader): That card is sick.




**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Bow of Nylea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bow+of+Nylea). The card is great versus Affinity and Burn. Deathtouch plus trample is always nice as well.




**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**  

Casting [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) into double [Elvish Archdruid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid) to pump my creatures three times with Ezuri’s [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) ability.

**Age:** 25


**Hometown:** Charleston, SC




**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  
  
**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Abzan Company. Strong combo deck with grind potential (and I love the [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company)).









**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company)/[Fiend Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter). Grind advantage engine that can combo kill and instant speed removal with [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling)/[Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company).






**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Tidehollow Sculler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler). Too good against combo and land decks.




**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**  
[Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) for a chain of Eternal Witnesses against Jund with an active [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township), or swinging my [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast) into a [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) and conceding.

**Age:** 22


**Hometown:** Raleigh, NC




**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**





**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Ad Nauseam. I have a pretty good version and have been playing it on *Magic Online* recently.





**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  

Ad Nauseam. The deck wouldn’t exist without it.







**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Leyline of Sanctity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Sanctity). Decks with seven or more discard spells are probably the deck’s worst matchups.







**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**  

Holding lands to discard to [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil)? Nothing too exciting.

**Age:** 23


**Hometown:** Fort Wayne




**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**






**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

I played “Robots” this weekend because I’m ana ggro player and it doesn’t get more aggressive than ‘bots.






**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) because once it resolves it’s near impossible to answer.






**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb). There was a ton of [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) decks with weekend and Orb can’t get Lighting Bolted, Path to Exiled, etc.





**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**  

I [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast)ed a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) a control player was trying to [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) to get a land.
