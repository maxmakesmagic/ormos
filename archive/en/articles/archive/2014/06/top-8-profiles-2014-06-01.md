Six Grand Prix Top 8s, two Pro Tour Top 8s.

Red-Green-White Aggro because I didn't have four Temple of Malady; wanted to play Black-Green-White Constellation.

[Purphoros, God of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%2C+God+of+the+Forge) main deck. It's the sickest card in the entire block.

Shark Games Store best player.

Red-White Heroic. I had no time to test the format and it looked like my kind of deck.

Any early creature. Maybe [Akroan Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Crusader), it's so hard to race.

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**
  
Lost last round of Pro Tour Journey into Nyx to Owen Turtenwald, in a match for fame and glory.
 



**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**
  
BUG Control. The longer games go, the more likely people are to make mistakes. And BUG makes sure games go very long.
 



**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**
  
I took my chances not having a good match-up against aggro with my list and didn't pay for it. So I'm happy with my 75.

[Prognostic Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx).
