It's my last article of the year, so I've decided to write something a little different than normal for my farewell article of 2013. You see, earlier this year, I was giving some advice to a friend and I realized it was something applicable to all of you because it has to do with living one's life and being a gamer. Since all of you (or possibly just most of you—maybe there's a few non-gamers reading my column. Hi Mom!) fit into both categories, life-livers and gamers, I thought this article might hit a chord.

In short, I want to give you a piece of advice about how to make your life better. The advice of this article is a very simple one. So simple, in fact, that I put it into the title. Being a gamer is an awesome thing. It gives you great life skills. What I've discovered, though, is that many gamers don't apply all the awesome gaming skills they've acquired to their lives. The point of this article is to say, "Stop doing that. You have awesome game skills. If you apply them to your life, I think you might be happier."
