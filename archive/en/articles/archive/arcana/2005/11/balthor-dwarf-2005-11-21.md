[Kamahl, Pit Fighter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kamahl%252C%2BPit%2BFighter) was not the only character to undergo a [Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kamahl%252C%2BFist%2Bof%2BKrosa) in the *Odyssey* block storyline. 


Kamahl's mentor, the dwarf weaponsmaster **[Balthor the Stout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Balthor%2Bthe%2BStout)**, had a bit of a change of heart as well.

Here is Balthor in his prime: surrounded by the barbarians of the Pardic Mountains, getting them pumped up and ready to fight. A fierce warrior and hero among men. 


But Balthor is killed in battle with the nightmarish [Laquatus's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Laquatus%2527s%2BChampion) of the villainous merfolk [Ambassador Laquatus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ambassador%2BLaquatus). 


That's not the end of the heroic dwarf's story, however. 


Balthor was later reanimated, his only goal to seek revenge on the evil Laquatus.

This Balthor is at his most desperate: his undead form is a curse, but a way to get vengeance on Laquatus. Laquatus proves able to control the zombified Balthor, however, due to the remnant of [Laquatus's champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laquatus%27s+champion) still lodged in his body. (Ironically, the card [Balthor the Defiled](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balthor+the+Defiled) is quite a nice combo with a graveyard full of [Laquatus's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laquatus%27s+Champion)s.)


At the end, Balthor's disciple [Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kamahl%252C%2BFist%2Bof%2BKrosa) does him the favor of slaying him for the second time -- and Kamahl slays Laquatus with his [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari)-enchanted sword, leaving Balthor finally at peace.


Enjoy Dwarf Week.
