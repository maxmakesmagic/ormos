**Known Issues With Scheduled Fixes for the Wednesday, August 12, *Magic Online* Client Update** 


**Card Grants**


When Season 9 Promos were granted during last week's downtime, it came to our attention that there was a miscommunication regarding which version of the [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) promo was being awarded to players as part of the [*Magic Online* Player Rewards](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2015-magic-online-player-rewards) program. We advertised one promo on the website and granted another during the Wednesday, July 29, downtime.


We apologize for this error in communication and would like to make it up to players by giving everyone who qualified for last month's MOPR reward the [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) promo that was advertised on [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online) in addition to the version they already received during the Wednesday, July 29, downtime. Expect to find the advertised version of [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) in your account following the Wednesday, August 12, downtime. Thank you for your understanding!

Temporary Workarounds for Known Issues
======================================



We're hard at work whittling down the Known Issues List. In the meantime, we've found temporary solutions that may help alleviate certain problems that players are experiencing. Refer to the table below to see if there is a suggested temporary workaround for an issue that you are experiencing.


**Game Play**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| Duel Scene | [Restore Balance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restore+Balance) will sometimes dim your hand and stall *Magic Online*. | If you encounter this issue, pressing F6 will continue the game. |
| Cardset | If a shield effect (examples include from a [Circle of Protection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection) or [Deflecting Palm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflecting+Palm)) is given to a creature during the declare blockers step, it will crash the game. 
 | Restarting the client will allow you to continue the game. |
| General | [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) counters are obscured by the equipped creature.
  | Players can use card zoom or the preview pane to determine the number of counters.
  |

**Client**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| General | Players can experience memory leaks in some situations.
  | Restarting the client can temporarily resolve these issues. |
| Collection | Dragging or adding a large number of cards to a deck or trade binder causes *Magic Online* to freeze while processing, resulting in a "Main Navigation is Not Responding" error.
  | While the client is not responsive, waiting several minutes will allow the process to complete. Using the error dialog to close the client will cancel the transaction. |
| Collection | Sorting by converted mana cost does not work correctly the first time it is attempted in a new deck or binder. 
 | Attempting to sort by converted mana cost a second time will fix the issue. |
| Duel Scene | Land can visually appear tapped at the start of a turn if a player unmorphs a creature during their opponent's end step.
  | The issue is visual only and clicking the tapped lands will add mana to the mana pool correctly. |
| Sideboard Issues:
 
 Duel Scene | Black game screen after sideboarding. 
 and
 Sideboard | Extra cards are sometimes added to a player's deck in addition to their choices when Sideboarding. | These issues seem to be tied to the player's computer going to sleep during deckbuilding. Making it so that your computer does not go into hibernation may alleviate these issues if you're experiencing them.
  |
| Store | Updating billing and shipping information during the checkout process can have inconsistent results.
  | Players who update from the Account Settings page should not have issues.
  |
| Trade | If you open a booster pack that is in your active trade binder, attempting to trade a different booster pack from the same set cancels the trade.
  | Logging out and then back in will correct this issue.
 |

**Server**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| Duel Scene | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out. | If you suspect this is happening to you, logging out and back in may resolve the problem. |
