Ahead of the set's October 2 release and September 26–27 Prerelease events, this weekend we hosted a spectacular *Battle for Zendikar* event at PAX Prime. Special guests Wil Wheaton and Ashly Burch (ably assisted by *Magic* R&D's Mark Rosewater and friends) unveiled a range of tantalizing titbits of information about the set. This included storyline details; a look at the set's mechanics and key cards; the return of Gideon, Ulamog, and full-art basic lands; plus an *extremely* special inclusion you'll find in some *Battle for Zendikar* boosters.

Story
=====


When we last visited Zendikar, the monstrous Eldrazi titans had been released from their prisons, and the Planeswalker Gideon Jura was leaving the plane to seek reinforcements.


Now, Gideon returns to find Zendikar on the brink of annihilation, with the Eldrazi titan Ulamog destroying everything in its path.


With Zendikar's future hanging by a thread, a group of Planeswalkers joins the Zendikari people—and even the land itself—to rise up against this alien threat.

Planeswalkers
=============


To defeat the Eldrazi, the Zendikari people are going to need some very powerful allies indeed. Fortunately, some of *Magic*'s strongest and most daring Planeswalkers have arrived to help—including Gideon.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_dp9Gkfb1hF.png)


Gideon's suite of abilities is extremely aggressive, reflecting how he's taking the fight straight to the Eldrazi. Whether he's entering the fray himself as a 5/5 creature, creating an army of 2/2 Knights, or bestowing an emblem to power up your whole team, you'll definitely want him on your side of the battlefield.


Which other Planeswalkers are joining the fight for Zendikar's future? Stay tuned!


Face Unnatural Disaster
=======================


The battle lines have been drawn, and it's time to save Zendikar from certain destruction. Let's stand together and face off against Ulamog, Planeswalkers!


Join the *Battle for Zendikar* and play with this exciting new *Magic* set first in *Magic Duels*, then at your local game store in Prerelease events September 26–27.

One last thing: *Zendikar Expeditions*
======================================


There's one final thing you need to know about *Battle for Zendikar*, and we've saved the best for last.


Certain packs of the set will include a very rare version of one of the most iconic lands in *Magic*'s history. Called *Zendikar Expeditions*, these are both premium foil **and** full-art! They are printed in English only, but can be opened in packs of all languages. There are 25 different lands that can be found in *Battle for Zendikar* packs, and you can expect to open one only a little more frequently than a premium foil *Battle for Zendikar* mythic rare.


These cards are legal in Limited formats like Sealed Deck and Draft. They will only be legal in Constructed formats where the most recent previous printings are legal.


I'll let the beauty of these cards speak for itself:
