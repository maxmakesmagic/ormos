**Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* Top 4 and Grand Prix Singapore Champion, Ken Yukuhiro:** I think Ojutai Bant is well-positioned now. It is good against Abzan Control and Atarka Red, so maybe no change for me.

**Grand Prix Minneapolis 2014 Champion, Park Jun Young:** I'm doing ok with Abzan Aggro, but given the choice I would rather play a Megamorph deck. Aside from [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) and [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector), there is also Stratus Dancer, [Hidden Dragonslayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Dragonslayer), and [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic). I think there is advantage to be had by playing with Morphs to confuse the opponent.

**2 Pro Tour Top 8s & Invitational Winner, Tiago Chan:** I played Mardu Dragons and was paired against five Abzan Control yesterday! It's not a very good match up. If I had known, I would have chosen Devotion or Sultai Whip instead.
