Sam Gomersall has been quietly racking up a number of money finishes at GP's and PT's, but is still lacking that breakout performance, despite making it onto the train earlier this year. Stuart Wright is a solid English player looking for a chance to prove himself on the international circuit. Gomersall needs to win out to make Top 8 whereas a win here would make it close to a lock for Wright. It will be tough though, as he's running Red-Green against Gomersall's Wake deck. 

### Game 1

Wright mulliganed but came racing out the blocks with [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) and [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). Gomersall got the vital turn two [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) and then cast [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress).

"How Lucky are you! Random [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)!" Wright said as Gomersall plucked an [Elephant Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Guide) from Wright's hand.

"That wasn't supposed to be good in this matchup."

Wright bolted to the dome and then summoned a [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur).

"Please don't kill all my guys," Stuart said.

Gomersall [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)ed and then put them all in the bin with a [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God).

Wright came back with a second Centaur and then had to try and beat his way through Gomersall's [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace). Gomersall was looking strong as [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) and other card drawing dug through his deck.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/euro03/a883.jpg)Wright stuck a Guide on the Centaur and bashed. Gomersall hampered his efforts with a [Renewed Faith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith). Wright sent a [Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammer) to the head.

"Sod it," Gomersall said, flashing back the [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and dropping to precarious 1 life.

Unfortunately sometimes Wake just doesn't do anything and this time was one of them as none of the cards helped out and Gomersall couldn't stop the Guided Centaur bashing his head in on the next turn.

Wright 1-0 Gomersall

### Game 2

Wright came haring in again in the second game: Lavamancer followed by Rootwalla and then a 2 point bolt to the head. Wright Guided up the Lavamancer and bashed Gomersall to 12. He took it, pulling two land out of the deck with a Verge and then passing turn again.

Wright swung again and the damage was negated with [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace). Wright added an Elephant to the mix with [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd), giving Gomersall something to ponder. He let it in and gained 5 life with [Renewed Faith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/euro03/a882.jpg)Next turn Gomersall tapped 5 mana for [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) giving Wright a window to batter with his forces. [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) sent the Guided Lavamancer packing and Gomersall took six plus another off his [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) to drop back to 10 life.

Gomersall laid another land and passed turn with a [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) looking threatening. Wright surged forward again and the damage was prevented by a flashed back [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace).

Another attack and Gomersall forked a [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to fetch [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) and [Renewed Faith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith). Wright was facing an uphill battle here. Next attack step was fogged again and Gomersall forked [Renewed Faith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith) to gain 11 life at end of turn.

[Sulfuric Vortex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfuric+Vortex) provided hope, but as Wright had drawn [Karplusan Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karplusan+Forest)s over [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s he was actually on less life. Red-Green has burn though, while Wake doesn't. Unfortunately despite the [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) in play Gomersall had run out of cards.

Wright hadn't.

Eruption, [Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammer) and then [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) brought the game to a savage end.

**Final Result:** Stuart Wright beat Sam Gomersall 2-0
