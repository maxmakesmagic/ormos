Crunch time comes early on Sunday. Two losses is the expected limit, and once you’re saddled with those you need to win out. The key, sports psychologists say, is to take each match as it comes.



**The Players**



Ian Farnung is a self-confessed travel junkie who’s been spotted making deep runs on Day 2s on at least three continents. With his Chicago crew he surprised the field at GP Sao Paulo and put up a Top 4 finish. He notched his first solo Top 8 at Orlando last year. This weekend he’s playing Abzan.



His opponent is actually the Champion from that Orlando event, Eugene Hwang. He’s been riding high since last season and is looking to further grow his reputation. He’s playing blue-red [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), spiced up with the addition of [Vedalken Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles).



**The Games**



Farnung opened with [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), seeing [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Vedalkan Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalkan+Shackles), [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) and lands. After a moment’s thought he got rid of the Shackles. Hwang played a land and was soon staring down a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), already a 3/4. Farnung hit him with another [Inquisition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition), saw that he’d drawn only lands, and got rid of [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite). He fetched out another land and delved out [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang). It was a textbook midrange opening, supercharged for Modern.



Hwang played his third land and was busted down to 7 for his temerity. He had to spend his fourth turn on Bolt and Snapcaster to rid himself of Tasigur, but with no solution for the [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) he couldn’t fight on long.

“Goyf is just too good in this matchup,” said Farnung.



“He really is. I mean, I’m *supposed* to lose game one.”



Farnung shipped back his opening seven. His six were acceptable, and they were off. Hwang was first on the board with a [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) on his second turn. Farnung summoned a tardy [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch). Hwang was happy to play it slow. Farnung fetched basic swamp out of respect for a potential [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon), then untapped and summoned [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Hwang [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)ed. Farnung passed it back with two open rather than recast his ‘Goyf.



Hwang played [Desolate Lighthouse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desolate+Lighthouse) and passed, losing his [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) to an end-of-turn [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay). Farnung again tried his ‘Goyf, and after a [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) he played it again and finally got it to stick. Any celebrations were immediately put on hiatus when Hwang dropped [Vedalken Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles) and stole the [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Farnung delved out [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang), leaving only [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) in his graveyard. He considered going for an activation of Tasigur, but decided against, instead summoning [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino).



Here Hwang was forced to cede control of the [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) in order to steal Tasigur on his turn. He also brought out an [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) for two before passing back.  Farnung drew, played [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township), and passed. Hwang paused at end of turn, and decided to blow the Explosives to keep from being overwhelmed by threats. He played land and passed, using his [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to blow up the Township when Farnung activated it.



Things were looking dire for Farnung. He couldn’t very well let Hwang go crazy with Tasigur, so he swung in with his Rhino. Naturally, Hwang blocked, happy to free his Shackles to steal another creature. He had [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) for Farnung’s last gasp, an [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek). Keranos soon joined his side of the board, and victory followed in short order.

Farnung led out with [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze), immediately Bolted by Hwang. He tried to replace it with [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), but Hwang stalled it off with [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand). Next up was [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek). Hwang turned over a hand of [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon), [Vedalken Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles), three [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)s and [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull). Farnung put [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) in the bin, which let his [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) enter play as a 5/6.



Hwang failed to draw a land and passed. Farnung sent in his [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Hwang flashed in [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) and targeted his [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). He blocked the [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), then flashed back [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to kill the ‘Goyf. The idea was that the exiled Bolt would leave the graveyard without instants, shrinking the [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), but Hwang had completely forgotten his own [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand).



Farnung continued to pour on the pressure with a post-combat [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). Hwang played Shackles but couldn’t steal anything and was brought down to five in a single attack. Worse, Farnung had [Fulminator Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage) to blow up [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents), keeping down the number of islands under Hwang’s control. Hwang tried to buy time with [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), but Farnung had all bases covered. [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) got it out of the way and sealed the match.
