The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 6, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by Cats. So many Cats.


Today's Previews
================


Every day until the full set is previewed on April 14, I'll be sharing all the non-DailyMTG previews you can find around the web in this space. Here are today's:


1. [Mouth to Feed](http://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_Btaacrcb4R.png) | Us goofing up

Oh, hey! That was . . . not intentional. But, well, it's up. Let's embrace it. Hippo tokens!


Also, check out [MTG Mint Card's review of the card](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/chapman-sim/operation-hippo-drop), which was supposed to be a preview but is now a lengthy review.


Don't worry. I've made sure they have another card to preview next week instead. I'm not heartless.


1. [Exclusive *Amonkhet* Preview Card!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apUsYF79dAg) | Windmill Slam

That is exactly what a Cat lord would act like. It is also what a normal, everyday cat would act like, as both of mine will attest. At 4:30 a.m. Sometimes 3:30 a.m.

1. [No Rest for the Wicked](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/aliaintrazi-04062017-no-rest-for-the-wicked/) | Gathering Magic | Ali Aintrazi

Liliana is looking pretty at home on Amonkhet, and maybe in Standard too, with a new, powerful incarnation of the Zombie queen.

The new [Uktabi Orangutan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Orangutan) doing *work*. Or [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman), if you're too young to remember the 90s.


And [Magma Spray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Spray) is coming for you, [Scrapheap Scrounger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapheap+Scrounger). As the kids would say, "get wrecked."


The kids would say that, right?


1. [Wizards of the Coast Europe Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BSivNioBlzJ/)

Our European office recently launched their Instagram account, so they're kicking it off with a very Bolas preview card—his very own throne. Naturally, it hurts everyone else. Because in Bolas's world, his gain is your pain.


1. [*Magic* Judges exclusive *Amonkhet* spoiler](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/blog/2017/04/06/magic-judges-exclusive-amonkhet-spoiler/) | Magic Judges Blog | Steven Briggs

Failure to Comply is not only a *Magic* card, but also what every judge will now be citing players for at every opportunity. Slow play? Failure to Comply with a reasonable pace. Failure to maintain game state? Failure to Comply with game state. Deck registration error? Failure to Comply with deck registration norms. You get the idea.

My boss's boss is kind of a big deal (her home smells of mahogany), so she got a pretty strong preview card. What do you plan to do with this poisonous person?

More artist art reveals during previews! We haven't shown off this card yet, but the art [was previewed by io9 yesterday](http://io9.gizmodo.com/an-exclusive-look-at-the-next-magic-the-gathering-expa-1794047622).


1. Cat Puns

The reveal of Regal Caracal has people tripping over one another to make [cat](https://twitter.com/misterorange/status/849984870839406592) [puns](https://twitter.com/TolarianCollege/status/849991844515553280) and [jokes](https://twitter.com/MtACast/status/849973355486875649). So, enjoy that on the internet today. Basically, just [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/63s29i/windmill_slam_exclusive_amonkhet_preview/dfwjpx0/) all over the place.


Synergy of the Day
==================


1. Always Watching

Doing a deck of the day during previews doesn't work, as we're still revealing everything we've got going on. So instead we're going to look at synergies uncovered during previews.


Today, we'll start with one everyone is raving about today—Glory-Bound Initiate.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_0CJxAhwpiU.png)


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Always+Watching)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Always+Watching) [![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thalia%27s+Lieutenant)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%27s+Lieutenant)
Glory-Bound Initiate can pack a punch—if it tries really, really hard. [Always Watching](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Always+Watching) makes that exertion so, so much easier. With just those two cards you can attack with a 5/5 lifelink creature on turn 3.


Now, add in the fact that Glory-Bound Initiate is a Human and you unlock all the Human synergies from *Shadows over Innistrad*.


Seems to me you've got the making of a pretty powerful aggressive deck going on here.
