 Without a doubt the most exciting card to enter Legacy from *Khans of Tarkir* was [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise). The deceptive eight mana sorcery fit right into decks that didn't have any use for spent spells. Using delve to turn the graveyard into a new resource, [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) typically calls for just one blue mana from a land to fire.




 It's dangerously similar to [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) at that point.




 Coming into the weekend the potency of [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) had been vetted at several Legacy events, including Eternal Weekend's Legacy winning decklist. While other *Khans of Tarkir* cards have helped budge Legacy in new ways, none have outshined what [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) did in so little time.



So we asked a simple question: Are you cruisin' or are you bruisin' this weekend?
