Right now, the Izzet have the most [Planeswalker Points](http://www.wizards.com/magic/planeswalkerpoints/guild). So that means they're the best, right?

Well, kind of. But let's look at the numbers in a little more detail. (Warning: These numbers will be slightly different from the screenshot because they're from earlier in the day. As any Izzet mage could tell you, reality is always changing around you.)




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Guild | Points |
| Izzet | 1,196,440 |
| Azorius | 1,062,519 |
| Dimir | 716,918 |
| Simic | 687,281 |
| Golgari | 573,337 |
| Selesnya | 426,569 |
| Boros | 409,609 |
| Orzhov | 379,854 |
| Rakdos | 367,086 |
| Gruul | 205,447 |

  
Well, not necessarily. Because the Izzet also have the most people:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Guild | Members |
| Izzet | 10,234 |
| Azorius | 8,564 |
| Golgari | 6,687 |
| Dimir | 6,489 |
| Selesnya | 5,637 |
| Simic | 5,195 |
| Rakdos | 4,511 |
| Boros | 4,324 |
| Orzhov | 3,573 |
| Gruul | 1,726 |

  
How about points per person?




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Guild | Points per Member |
| Simic | 132.30 |
| Azorius | 124.07 |
| Gruul | 119.03 |
| Izzet | 116.91 |
| Dimir | 110.48 |
| Orzhov | 106.31 |
| Boros | 94.73 |
| Golgari | 85.74 |
| Rakdos | 81.38 |
| Selesnya | 75.67 |

  
Now the Simic are winning! And Gruul, who were dead last, are now ahead of Izzet!


But what if we looked at the people who won the last few big tournaments?


**Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica***: Stanislav Cifka (Izzet)   
**Grand Prix Philadelphia**: Shuhei Nakamura (Orzhov)   
**Grand Prix Auckland**: Walker MacMurdo (Orzhov)   
**Grand Prix Lyon**: Jérémy Dezani (Orzhov)   
**Grand Prix Chicago**: Jacob Wilson (Simic)


Sure, there's an Izzet and a Simic in there. But three Grand Prix champions in a row were Orzhov!


If you're tired of Izzet's lead, remember that you have the power to change things. Have you picked a guild on [Planeswalker Points](http://www.wizards.com/magic/planeswalkerpoints/guild) yet? Don't you think it's time you did?
