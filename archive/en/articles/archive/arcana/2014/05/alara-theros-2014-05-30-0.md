The Modern Event Deck goes on sale today! [It includes](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/299a) 1 [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant), a card first introduced in *Shards of Alara*. All this week, [the Card of the Day theme](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/cardoftheday/0514) has been about the Elspeth story on Theros (spoilers!), which tied in with Monday's feature, "[Journey's End](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/301)." So it makes sense to bookend the week with an Arcana about [Elspeth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=212241), [knight-errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=174859) and [sun's champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373649).
