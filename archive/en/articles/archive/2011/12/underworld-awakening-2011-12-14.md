There are a lot of Vampires and Werewolves in *Innistrad*. You know what else has both of those things? The *Underworld* movies! Well, it has Lycans instead of Werewolves, but that's close enough. The important part here is that we've got a contest that involves the movie *[Underworld Awakening](http://www.entertheunderworld.com/)*, which will hit movie theatres on January 20, 2012. Here's a trailer!
