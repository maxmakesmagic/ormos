[Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/journeyintonyx14)  

Cobb Galleria Centre  

Atlanta, Georgia, USA  

May 16-18, 2014





Some of you may not know this about me but I'm a Georgia boy. I was born in a suburb of Atlanta called Roswell (note: not where the aliens landed... or at least that's what we want you to think). I did most of my growing up in Florida but I also went to college in Atlanta when I attended Georgia Tech.


The fact that the Pro Tour is returning to Atlanta is a bit more exciting for me as it gives me a chance to take a quick vacation before the event to spend time with family as well as show my wife around the city.


If you're within driving (or even flying) distance you should come out and watch the event! There will be lots of awesome **Magic** being played alongside other sweet hall activities.


Check out this awesome video from our friends Nate Holt & Shawn Kornhauser:
