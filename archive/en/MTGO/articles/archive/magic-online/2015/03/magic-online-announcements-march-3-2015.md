**Legacy Cube Update**


The results are in from the latest run of the *Magic Online* Legacy Cube! Randy Buehler and *Magic* R&D have gone over data showing how players used the first iteration of the Legacy Cube and have come up with some changes that will be implemented in the Legacy Cube's next run.


Read Randy Buehler's full [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/legacy-cube-update-2015-03-02) for a detailed account of the reasoning that went into the upcoming Legacy Cube changes, a list of what's entering and exiting the Cube, as well as a link to the [complete Cube cardlist](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/legacy-cube-cardlist-2015-03-02).


Legacy Cube Events return to *Magic Online* on Wednesday, March 18 and run through Wednesday, April 1 alongside *Rise of the Eldrazi* 6-2-2-2 Drafts.

***Fate Reforged* Redemption Begins Wednesday, March 4**


*Fate Reforged* Redemption begins on Wednesday, March 4! Start filling out your digital *Fate Reforged* collection now if you're interested in redeeming it for a full paper set.


Many players have asked us about the lands in Fate Reforged: how to get them, how they interact with redemption, etc.


As far as redemption is concerned, this is simple: Every card in the Fate Reforged set is required for redemption except the basic lands. Basic lands are not required to redeem a set of Fate Reforged, either standard or premium. Promotional cards and Khans of Tarkir cards are not required.


While they are not required for redemption, you can still collect Fate Reforged basic lands. Intro Packs have non-premium versions of these lands, and premium versions can be found in booster packs at the same rate as in other sets.


Learn more about the *Magic Online* [Redemption Policy](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-general-resources/magic-online-redemption-policies-2014-02-04).
