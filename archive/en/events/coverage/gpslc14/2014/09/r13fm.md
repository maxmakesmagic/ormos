 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






 If you're new to *Magic* coverage, or have just been hiding under a rock on Mars, you may not know Paul Rietzl. The Pro Tour Hall of Fame elect sits at a comfortable 13th-ranked slot in the Top 25, with well over a decade of competitive success across Grand Prix and Pro Tour levels. Among his feats, after willing Pro Tour Amsterdam in 2010, was narrowly missing the Top 8 of Grand Prix Paris in 2012... at the same time as he fought to a Pro Tour Paris finals showdown.




 Paul Rietzl plays good *Magic*.



Allen Sun is a name new to the coverage team and readers at home. Entering just his second Grand Prix this weekend at Salt Lake City, Sun put up a stellar run on Day 1 to an undefeated record of 8-0-1 then followed it my claiming the King of the Hill seat from Nathan Holiday and never looked back. Through twelve rounds, Sun had yet to sign a match slip with a loss for him.


Of course, no king rules forever and Sun was in for the fight of the chair.



**The Decks**




 After drafting a deck he "was very happy with" in the first draft, Rietzl's rails wavered slightly. His triple [Generator Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Generator+Servant), [Ancient Silverback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Silverback), [Burning Anger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Anger) deck was support with hits such as two copies of [Vineweft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vineweft). "I've never cast this card. We'll see," Rietzl said during deck construction.




 Sun's deck was, perhaps, a little more exciting. With two copies each of [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) and [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) Sun had assembled an aggressive deck that could pound on the ground or soar to victory. It wasn't the most interesting of ways to try and win – [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) was one of the premium white commons one could draft in the format – but it's reliability wasn't to be denied.




**The Games**



"My deck does one thing so I'll just keep doing that. I'm in my element." After a beat Rietzl asked the obligatory follow up: "Get it?"



 It was a strange start for the top ranked player. While Rietzl swarmed the board with three copies of [Generator Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Generator+Servant) – two of which traded early – it was Sun that ran into trouble stuck on three lands. Stranded cards in Sun's hand meant Rietzl's slower start could have taken off, but he seemed to find more lands than he needed.






*Allen Sun wanted to hold the King of the Hill crown, but his mana wasn't cooperative.*
