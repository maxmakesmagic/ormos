***2011 World Championship Semifinalist Conley Woods:**  "Turn & Burn. I would play more if I wasn't playing five colors. If I was just Blue-Red Green or Blue-Red I'd play two or three right now. It kills [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s, deals with [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa)s, and sets up a lot of two-for-ones.*

***No. 23 Ranked Player Eric Froehlich:**  "[Dreadbore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreadbore). It has more functionality against control decks. Every deck is very powerful, either with creatures or planeswalkers. [Dreadbore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreadbore) deals with them either way.*

***Hall of Famer Brian Kibler:**  "[Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock). [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) costs one mana, and against aggressive decks you're playing against time rather than value. Being able to kill something for one mana and play something else that same turn is valuable. You're mostly trying to buy time against a lot of those decks.*

***Five-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor Ben Lundquist:**  ""The most underrated removal spell I think is [Dimir Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Charm). It's like [Last Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) but it can also counter things like [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Rakdos's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return).*

***No. 6 Ranked Player Shahar Shenhar:**  "[Golgari Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Charm) and [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay). They are so versatile. For [Golgari Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Charm), against Elspseth, Sun's Champion for example you can -1/-1 their team and attack in when their plan is to chump-block. It kills [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections), it can regenerate your team and it kills [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere)s end-of-turn. Abrupt Decay is kind of the same thing. It doesn't stop Elspeth, but it's a main-deck card since it can kill almost anything. It can kill both bestow creatures, [Nighthowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nighthowler) and [Herald of Torment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Torment).*
