Maher is unconcerned with his lack of preparation. He's got tons of experience with [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) from way back. His opponent, Justin Gary, is playing an updated version of the Oath deck that he used to win Pro Tour – Houston. He's playing it with every bit of the bombast he showed at that event. 

### Game 1

Gary mulliganed once, but kept his six. Maher led with island and [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), and then tried [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) and [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker). Gary shrugged and showed him the [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike). Maher tried again on the following turn, losing his City to play an extra island. This time it was [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). He made another [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key).

Gary played a [Polluted Delta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) and passed it back. Maher drew [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) and resolved it, after Gary manipulated his hand with [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and the Delta. Maher was unwilling to risk anything further in the face of four untapped mana, though, so Gary got to cast [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). He took [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace), [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) and island over land and Oath. That left Maher free to Stroke for six.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a394.jpg)Gassed up, Maher started to cast spells. Monolith resolved, and that fuelled a [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) that had Gary thinking. He eventually chose to [Forbid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbid) it, buying it back. Maher took the opportunity to [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) out [Mishra's Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Helix), taking control of the game. Soon he'd locked down all of Gary's lands but two green, and played [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) with a blue and four colorless floating. He finished up by dropping [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), two Keys, island, then [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed away a Key for [Phyrexian Processor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Processor) for eighteen, exactly Gary's life total. Maher was left at one.

"Hope I draw mountain for my [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)" was all Justin could say.

Maher 1 – Gary 0

### Game 2

Maher's turn-one Monolith off [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) went unopposed by Gary's sole island. Both players played lands, but Maher's were [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port)s. He started to work over Gary's mana, helped out by Gary's stalling on three despite a [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). After leaving Gary with just an island and swamp untapped, he [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed away his Monolith. Gary had no response. Maher fetched the mighty [Mishra's Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Helix). [Null Brooch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Null+Brooch) also resolved.

He had enough mana left over to lock down Gary's black sources. Gary thought, and [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ed in response, leaving a blue up. He got three [Yavimaya Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Coast)s. That let him [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) his way out of the Helix. Maher dropped [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) and Stroked for five while Gary was tapped out.

Gary again had to put on his thinking cap. After a few minutes contemplation he shrugged his shoulders.

"I'm not sure how this is going to play out."

He showed [Arcane Laboratory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Laboratory). Maher just laughed. "Good beats."

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a395.jpg)He tried [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire). Gary Forbade it with buyback. Maher's Ports restricted his mana. He let a [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) through. Then the Ports paved the way for [Defense Grid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defense+Grid). After that, it was [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). Maher floated five colorless, and after Gary floated four blue mana he added two more, falling to four.

Gary had [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) for the [Defense Grid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defense+Grid), then let Monolith resolve. Maher played an island and [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), clearing his mana pool. That too was okay. He forced out Gary's mana by entering his attack phase, and added [Seal of Removal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Removal). Gary played an island.

Maher activated [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) for four, showing Processor and Dynamo. The Dynamo resolved. The Processor met a [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike), but Maher simply paid and played [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) to make a token. Gary played a [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village). Maher sealed the deal by [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ing out a [Mishra's Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Helix).

**Final Result:** Bob Maher defeats Justin Gary 2-0
