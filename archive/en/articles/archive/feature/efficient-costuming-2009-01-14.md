We're always impressed by people who [make costumes](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1717) to look like **Magic** cards. And of course we're always on the lookout for things to do [with extra **Magic** cards](/en/articles/archive/more-menger-2008-04-29).


Are you thinking what we're thinking? What if somehow someone could create a **Magic** costume *out of **Magic** cards*?


Hmm. What card would lend itself to that? Well...

Yes! Perfect! Now all we have to do is—wait. What?


You'll never believe this, folks, but I've just been informed that someone at PAX 2008 beat us to it.

Incidentally, we're impressed that this convention costume seamlessly incorporates the PAX badge. Too many times, you see someone with an incredibly elaborate outfit with a plastic badge holder hanging off in an unseemly manner.
