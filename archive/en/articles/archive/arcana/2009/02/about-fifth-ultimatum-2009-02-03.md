Back in October, we showed you [the Planeswalkers responsible](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1707) for the action in [Brilliant Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Brilliant%2BUltimatum), [Clarion Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Clarion%2BUltimatum), [Titanic Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Titanic%2BUltimatum), and [Violent Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Violent%2BUltimatum). As you no doubt noticed, one Ultimatum was skipped. But now that [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker) has appeared in *Conflux*, we thought it might be fun to go back to [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum) and look for hints of Bolas's presence.


The original art description for [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum) said this:



> Location: Grixis, inside a towering necropolis, in a huge room made of blackened skulls and bones of all kinds  
> 
> Action: Show something no one would expect to see: a great, winged demon lord . . . cowering in a corner. Maybe's he's even clutching a gut wound that oozes black blood. On the walls around the cowering demon we see the huge shadow of a figure whose shape is distorted by the skulls and bones of the room's walls. The shadow reaches an outstretched, clawlike hand toward the demon.  
> 
> Focus: the scene  
> 
> Mood: A creature of supreme evil dominance, brought low and terrified.  
> 
> Notes: The shadow should suggest some kind of enormous humanoid dragon or dragon/demon hybrid. It's meant to be a very subtle clue/teaser for a character that players won't see until later.


Here's the sketch that Ralph Horsley turned in:
