Peter Adkison was the founder of Wizards of the Coast and its CEO until 2001. When *Legends* was being created, the designers wanted to pay homage to Peter.

Alchor was the name of Peter's main Dungeon & Dragons character that he had been playing for nearly 20 years. Steve Conard designed a card called Alchor's Tome, which was fitting because Alchor was a great and powerful magician. But in a file somewhere along the line "Tome" was misspelled as "Tomb." No one caught the mix-up, and the artist painted exactly what he was told to: a tomb. With that art, there was no other option but to leave it as [Alchor's Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alchor%27s+Tomb).

Peter was amused by the implication that Alchor was dead, stating, "It's appropriate; I seldom get a chance to play anymore since I started Wizards of the Coast."
