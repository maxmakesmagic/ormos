### Game One



Zimmermann kicked off the information war with [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), taking away [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) from Dreger while also seeing [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Red Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Sun%27s+Zenith) and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). [Clear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clear)ly Zimmermann didn't want his hand given away. But Dreger had another [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), and [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) for Zimmermann's second [Inquisition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition). Zimmermann was happy to see no [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) in Dregers hand, but two turns later, Dreger simply drew one and put it on the battlefield to the crowd's amusement.


As in his quarterfinal match, Dreger burned through cards like only the Ascension deck can. That gave him [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) to counter Zimmermann's [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) – an important spell, as that one gave Dreger the second counter on his [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). Dreger then played a second Ascension and [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed and Foresaw and Saw Beyond to quickly put a second counter on that one, too. A bunch of draw and search spells later, Zimmermann conceded game one.

Both players went to their sideboards and changed their decks. Tobias Dreger simply took out 4 [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) and added 3 [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep) and 1 [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) from his sideboard.


Martin Zimmermann's plan was a little more intricate. His changes looked like this:


### IN


+ 4 [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze)  



### OUT


- 1 [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum)  




### Game Two



Once more, Zimmermann decided to put an [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) out as a first feeler. He saw 2 [See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond), [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) and 2 fetchlands in Dreger's opening hand and made him discard the [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). Dreger had drawn a [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), though, and returned the favor of probing for information. He saw 2 [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) and two more lands.


The two players essentially replayed their first couple of turns without much difference – once again, Zimmermann took a [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) from Dreger's hand. But Dreger simply saw more cards from his deck overall, and one of them was [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) that immediately received two counters through the usual small spells.


Zimmermann's main problem was that his deck had no way to deal with [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) on the battlefield other than one [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) and one [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). Though Zimmermann played [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) to help him find a solution, his biggest hope were his counterspells. But even those would never be enough to stop all copies.

*'...When he put a third Pyromancer Ascension on the battlefield and pumped it up to two counters, Zimmermann slumped...'* |



A case in point was the [Red Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Sun%27s+Zenith) that Dreger played to kill [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess). Zimmermann tried [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) to counter at least one copy, to keep [Liliana](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana) alive. But Dreger not only had a copy of Zenith, but also [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) to stop the [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) entirely. And of course, Dreger simply drew more cards. When he put a third [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) on the battlefield and pumped it up to two counters, Zimmermann slumped.


However, Dreger was already down to 8 life, mostly damaging himself through fetchlands. Zimmermann attacked with [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit). But against three loaded Ascensions, that plan seemed much too slow – and it was, as it turned out, especially since Dreger still had [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) to just kill it.


Tobias Dreger 2 – 0 Martin Zimmermann



### Game Three



Zimmermann decided to play first and immediately mulliganed to six cards in hand. Neither player had [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) or [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), so for the first few turns the fog of war engulfed their hands. Until Dreger had [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe). Zimmermann sat on a hand of [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze), [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum), [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) and [Go for the Throat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) – but he was missing land drops.


Four mana was just enough to play [Memoricide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide), though. Dreger had to let it resolve, with a hand of [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning), [See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond), [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) – and [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). Of course, that was what Zimmermann had in mind to name anyway! Without his Ascensions, Dreger had to try and win this game the hard way, with Bolts, Bursts, [Red Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Sun%27s+Zenith) and [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx).


A reinvigorated Zimmermann was happy to summon [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) to the battlefield and to let Dreger dig through his deck with [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and [See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond). [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) followed from Zimmermann, but did nothing: [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) from Dreger drew out [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) from Zimmermann, but after an untap a second Bolt killed Jace for good and Dreger used [Red Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Sun%27s+Zenith) to remove [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum).


Zimmermann was unfazed. Small wonder, as he tapped all his lands to put [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) on the battlefield! Dreger was holding [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) which he played, knowing full well that Zimmermann was still holding [Go for the Throat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat), but the feeble resistance was futile and Martin took the game.


Tobias Dreger 2 – 1 Martin Zimmermann

### Game Four



Dreger pondered long over his initial hand and decided to ship it back for lack of land. [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) from Zimmermann revealed that his second set had enough land, but only [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) and [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) as spells, and the [Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Probe) quickly went away. A turn later, Zimmermann played a second [Inquisition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition), which Dreger countered with his [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). A third [Inquisition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition) was met by [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep). With that, Dreger had successfully protected the [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) he had just drawn to put it on the battlefield.


[Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) showed Dreger that Zimmermann held [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze), [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess), [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx). But all of that wasn't much help as Dreger exploded in a flurry of copied cantrips.


A second [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) immediately gained two counters as well. Zimmermann slouched in his chair after he had pressed F6 to cede priority to Dreger for the turn. There was nothing he could do, and after Dreger countered [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess), Martin extended the hand and Tobias Dreger advanced to the finals!


**Tobias Dreger 3 – 1 Martin Zimmermann**
