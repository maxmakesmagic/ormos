Jakub Slemr is an old school magic player who won the World Championships a couple of years ago but has since faded from the spotlights. Today he’s back to regain some of his [Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory) playing a Blue/Green threshold deck. His opponent, Pedro Velhinho, is a newcomer to high level success but has proved to be up for the challenge with this top 8. He is playing a mono black deck.

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/891.jpg)Slemr won the die roll and decided to play first. He thought long and hard about his opening hand but he kept it in the end. Slemr led with a [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose) that got killed by an [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood). He drew a blue source on turn 2 and proceeded to [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) away a Rootwalla and a [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm). A [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) followed soon after and forced Pedro to Tutor for [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate).

Jakub got one big attack in before Pedro swept the board triggering Jakub’s [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill). Slemr was stuck on 2 lands at this point and was unable to flashback his Roars so when Pedro played a [Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes) the next turn he lost every single spell in his deck.

He still had a [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and a [Mental Note](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Note) in his hand though, so he followed up his Mongoose with a Mongrel and killed Pedro the next turn with the [Mental Note](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Note) and the two creatures when Pedro decided to not look for an Edict or Blood with a [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying).

### Game 2

Pedro played first this game and he kept a hand with 2 [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood)s, a [Ghastly Demise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise) and 4 land to make sure he’d survive till the late game to find his powerful spells. He took out the first three creatures Jakub cast and then played [Rancid Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth) on a forest.

He got punished soon after when the obviously colour screwed Slemr not only drew the Island he needed to cast his blue spells but also enchanted two of his lands with [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest)s. Pedro managed to get rid of one Nest with a Tutored for [Rancid Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth) but the second combined with a [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) ended the game in a couple of attack phases.

Jakub Slemt advances to the semifinals where he has to play the English [Millikin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin) Braids deck piloted by the one remaining Englishman in the GP.
