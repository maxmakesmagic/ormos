*Chromatic Cube* Starts June 25
===============================


The newest cube in *MTG Arena* opens for play tomorrow, June 25, and runs through July 8. This cube focuses on being in lots of colors and having lots of mana! Compete in both Best-of-One and traditional Best-of-Three matches.


Stop by this Friday for full details!


The End of *Jumpstart* Is Fast Approaching
==========================================


You still have time to play *Jumpstart* now through July 8! Play [with the same themed 20-card packets and the same card swaps made for the previous *MTG Arena* release.](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/2020-jumpstart-event-returns-mtg-arena)


Cards in each packet you select become part of your collection. Plus, each packet contains a basic land card with art that is exclusive to *Jumpstart*—you can only get these in *Jumpstart*!


Check out the full [*Jumpstart* details and decklists on *MTG Arena*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/2020-jumpstart-event-returns-mtg-arena) for more.


**Dates**: June 4–July 8, 2021  
**Entry**: 2,000 gold or 400 gems  
**Rewards**: One *Jumpstart* rare or mythic rare individual card reward for each of your first two wins  
**Event Record**: Play as much as you like! Resign when you want.


Want to change up your deck? After resigning, you may pay the entry and select different packets to play again!


Turbo Draft *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths* June 26–29
==================================================


Turbo Draft *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths* opens June 26 and runs just four days until June 29. Draft cards against bots—so no time limit for selecting cards—to build a 40-card deck, and then get ready for turbocharged matches!


Each player gets an emblem with "Spells you cast cost {5} less," reducing the generic mana costs of spells (color mana costs are not reduced). This also applies to casting spells with mutate!


Buckle up for high-powered, high-speed gameplay with some of the biggest monsters in *MTG Arena*!
