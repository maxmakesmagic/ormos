By Wizards of the Coast











![Priests of Norn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Priests+of+Norn)**[Priests of Norn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priests+of+Norn)** – *Mirrodin Besieged* common. Prior to *Mirrodin Besieged*, the Phyrexians have never really been thought of as being associated with white mana. But after all, they do represent a highly structured and organized society...
 ![Dancing Scimitar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dancing+Scimitar)**[Dancing Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dancing+Scimitar)** – *Arabian Nights* rare. Well before the living weapons of *Mirrodin Besieged*, there was [Dancing Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dancing+Scimitar), a sword animated by magic in *Arabian Nights*. Its 5 toughness presumably represents how hard it is to kill a sword, not an inordinately strong metal.
 ![Poisonbelly Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Poisonbelly+Ogre)**[Poisonbelly Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Poisonbelly+Ogre)** – *Guildpact* common. The flavor text for [Poisonbelly Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Poisonbelly+Ogre) speculates that it might be of either Simic or Golgari origin. Of the two, Golgari seems more likely, since the Simic guild doesn't involve black mana. Neither guild was in *Guildpact*, but the Ogre surely isn't Orzhov.
 ![Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Metalworker)**[Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker)** – *Urza's Destiny* rare. Back in the days of 2000-2003, when [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) was tearing up tournaments, the deck was sometimes referred to as "mono-brown" because it was all artifacts. That name stopped working when artifacts stopped having brown card borders.
 ![Battle Cry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Battle+Cry)**[Battle Cry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Cry)** – *Ice Age* uncommon. Including to [Battle Cry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Cry), General Jarkeld, the Arctic Fox appears in the flavor text of [fifteen cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&flavor=+%5BJarkeld%5D) in *Ice Age*. He's also shown on [General Jarkeld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=General+Jarkeld), but he's not saying anything.
 ![Infected Vermin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Infected+Vermin)**[Infected Vermin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infected+Vermin)** – *Odyssey* uncommon. At first, [Infected Vermin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infected+Vermin) behaves just like a [Pestilence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) that can kill itself. But if enough things have died, the disease can really take off. It's still going to be tough on the [Infected Vermin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infected+Vermin), though.
 ![Phyrexian Rager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyrexian+Rager)**[Phyrexian Rager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Rager)** – *Apocalypse* common. [Phyrexian Rager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Rager) first appeared in *Apocalypse*, then showed up in *Tenth Edition* and *Duel Decks: Garruk vs. Liliana*. And it's also in *Mirrodin Besieged*! That Horror sure gets around.
 ![Mirrodin's Core](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mirrodin%27s+Core)**[Mirrodin's Core](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrodin%27s+Core)** – *Darksteel* uncommon. According to the *Mirrodin* Style Guide, "The interior of Mirrodin is a vast, featureless expanse of silvery, dull metal. The only features of the landscape are the mycosynth, the occasional artifact creature, and Panopticon. The interior is lit by the mana-core sun, which washes everything in intense, pure-white light. The mana core appears as a giant sphere of pure white plasma suspended at the nucleus of the planar sphere."
 ![Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arrest)**[Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest)** – *Mercadian Masques* common. We're going to skip over the fact that [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) is in both *Mirrodin* and *Scars of Mirrodin*, because we've never noticed its *Mercadian Masques* flavor text before. Did you know the person being arrested is [Orim, Samite Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%2C+Samite+Healer)? For *murder*?
 ![Myr Battlesphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Myr+Battlesphere)**[Myr Battlesphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Battlesphere)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* rare. Statistics show that there are more Myr on [Myr Battlesphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Battlesphere) than on any five cards put together. The art was provided as a wallpaper [here](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-myr-battlesphere-2010-10-01).
 ![Auriok Siege Sled](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Auriok+Siege+Sled)**[Auriok Siege Sled](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Siege+Sled)** – *Darksteel* uncommon. In case you've ever wondered, if you use both of [Auriok Siege Sled](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Siege+Sled)'s abilities on the same creature, that creature won't be able to block the sled that turn.
 ![Look at Me, I'm R&D](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Look+at+Me%2C+I%27m+R%26D)**[Look at Me, I'm R&D](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Look+at+Me%2C+I%27m+R%26D)** – *Unhinged* rare. [Look at Me, I'm R&D](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Look+at+Me%2C+I%27m+R%26D) is the only card in **Magic** with no artist credit. It also had no art!
 ![Blade of the Sixth Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blade+of+the+Sixth+Pride)**[Blade of the Sixth Pride](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+of+the+Sixth+Pride)** – *Future Sight* common. *Future Sight* brought the "future-shifted" card frame into **Magic**, and the future-shifted vanillas had their own textless version. There's room for eight mana symbols there, which ought to be enough for any creature. Well, any vanilla creature. Sorry, [Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) and [B.F.M. (Big Furry Monster)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=B.F.M.%2B%2528Big%2BFurry%2BMonster%2529)!
 ![     ](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=+++++)**[\_\_\_\_\_](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=_____)** – *Unhinged* uncommon. What can you do with a card with no name? Well, not much. But what can you do with a card that can set its own name to anything? Mark Gottlieb covered this question [in detail](/en/articles/archive/blankety-blank-2004-12-09), and the answer is: a lot! Didn't think of [Bazaar of Wonders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Wonders), didja?
 ![Cyclopean Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cyclopean+Tomb)**[Cyclopean Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclopean+Tomb)** – *Masters Edition IV* rare. The Alpha version of [Cyclopean Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclopean+Tomb) was printed without a mana cost. This error was corrected in Beta (it's ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)), and that was the last nonland card printed without a mana cost ... until [Evermind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evermind).
 ![Nameless Race](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nameless+Race)**[Nameless Race](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Race)** – *The Dark* rare. Since 2007's [Grand Creature Type Update](/en/articles/archive/grand-creature-type-update-2007-09-26), every creature in **Magic** has at least one creature type. Except one: [Nameless Race](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Race), because, well, look at the name!
 ![Beacon of Creation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Beacon+of+Creation)**[Beacon of Creation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Creation)** – *Fifth Dawn* rare. Three of the *Fifth Dawn* Beacons were in *Tenth Edition*, but [Beacon of Creation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Creation) and [Beacon of Tomorrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Tomorrows) didn't make the cut. Aaron Forsythe [explained why](/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-september-2007-2007-09-04) a few years ago, but it was basically because they overlapped too much with more interesting options in their colors.
 ![Genesis Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Genesis+Wave)**[Genesis Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Wave)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* rare. [Genesis Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Wave) was the key card in David Williams's deck at the 2010 **Magic: The Gathering** World Championships. For a complete decklist and video deck tech, check out the [Daily Deck](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/deck/605) for December 17, 2010.
 ![First Come, First Served](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=First+Come%2C+First+Served)**[First Come, First Served](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=First+Come%2C+First+Served)** – *Unhinged* uncommon. In case you're wondering, the [*Unhinged* FAQ](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=magic/faq/unhinged) says that tokens don't have collector numbers. But that was before tokens started being included in packs, and the modern tokens *do* have numbers. Well, *Unhinged* packs actually did have tokens with collector numbers, but back then, they were in the minority.
 ![Scroll of Origins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scroll+of+Origins)**[Scroll of Origins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+of+Origins)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* rare. There's a tongue-in-cheek rule of thumb in **Magic** design that a fair land can be turned into a fair artifact that costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif). For example, [Shadowblood Ridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowblood+Ridge) and [Rakdos Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Signet) are both fair cards. [Scroll of Origins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+of+Origins) is based on [Library of Alexandria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library+of+Alexandria), but without the ability to tap for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) and with an additional activation cost. The exact text of [Library of Alexandria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library+of+Alexandria) wouldn't be fair on a two-mana artifact, suggesting that [Library of Alexandria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library+of+Alexandria) wasn't a fair land. But we knew that already.
 ![Pattern of Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pattern+of+Rebirth)**[Pattern of Rebirth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pattern+of+Rebirth)** – *Urza's Destiny* rare. There's a fairly complicated combo involving [Phyrexian Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Ghoul), [Academy Rector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Rector), [Pattern of Rebirth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pattern+of+Rebirth), and [Saproling Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saproling+Burst), but there's no room to go into it here. It was described [back in 2002](/en/articles/archive/nature-and-nurture-2002-10-23) by Ben Bleiweiss.
