After falling off for a bit, "Mono-Black" Devotion is back! As it turns out, splashing red and splashing blue are both options that help Mono-Black reclaim its top spot in today's metagame. Last week, [I covered Eric Froehlich's BR Devotion](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/deck/1462), and today I have [Tamás Glied](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/292#2)'s UB Devotion.



![Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ashiok,%20Nightmare%20Weaver&options=)Under the screen name Mazuku94, Glied ran the tables with his version of devotion at the [**Magic Online** Championship](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/mocs13/welcome). On top of the unusual choice to splash [Notion Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Notion+Thief), Glied also had the full four [Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver)s in his seventy-five! It's clear Glied was ready for control decks, but even though there were only four in the field, he still won all of his Swiss matches.

Yuuya Watanabe won [Grand Prix Beijing](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpbei14/welcome) with Mono-Black Devotion featuring [Staff of the Death Magus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staff+of+the+Death+Magus), which will likely work its way into the sideboard of any black devotion deck. A couple other options I've seen floating around in the UB version are main-deck [Far &amp; Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Far+%26amp%3B+Away) or sideboard [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate).


Week after week, the innovators are getting paid off, even if it's only the addition of a new card or two. Those cards can make all the difference!
