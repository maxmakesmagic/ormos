Gregory Orange finished 18th at last Pro Tour in Portland, and he was getting awfully close to improving on that finish here this weekend. But he'd first have to beat 5th-ranked Ivan Floch, who can't improve on his finish at that event, because he won it.


When I got to the table, Orange was waiting as Floch finished a video interview at the news desk. 


"If he's playing what I think he's playing, I don't think this is a good match-up for me," Orange confided, confirming what I had already suspected after viewing their decklists backstage.



 Floch was playing a Blue-Black control deck designed to prey on slower decks like Orange's Esper Planeswalker list. Short of a flurry of early [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)s and Planeswalkers from Orange, Floch would be heavily favored in this match.





*Ivan Floch settles into his match against Greg Orange, both feeling fairly sure that Orange had an uphill battle.*
