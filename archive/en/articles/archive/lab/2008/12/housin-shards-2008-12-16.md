*With not many articles to choose from, I guess you could say I copped out and picked the one that generated the most mail. The [Lich's Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich%27s+Mirror) + [Rain of Gore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rain+of+Gore) interaction divided some responses between positive and negative ("There's no such thing as infinite losses!"). Lich's Losses was in fact one of my favorite decks I'd built, but INVISIBLE AMBUSH was another treat. The random two-card combos I senselessly threw in the beginning was another stand-out factor, I guess. Finally, as some strange trivia, before realizing I had been incorrectly spelling the Elemental lord "Incandescent Soul*stroke*," the final deck was named 12:51 with the 5 underlined. To this day, the word "stoke" irks me.*

As *Shards of Alara* is let loose among the general public, I (with teary eyes and a tender heart) have bidden farewell to *Time Spiral* block and the last set of *Ice Age* block. Apparently *Time Spiral*'s last vanishing counter came off, causing its rotation. As for *Coldsnap*, I couldn't afford to pay any more cumulative upkeep. Or hypothermia costs. Or for [Jokulmorder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jokulmorder), that Timmy-esque rare that screams "Use me!! I'm shiny!" and yet laughs in the face of decent deck-building in general. While thinking up unused angles for forgotten *Coldsnap* cards last week, I managed to land an [Elemental Mastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elemental+Mastery) on the giant orca (who was saddled with [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) at the time), and play an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) to create 12 hasty tokens to win the game. That happened all of once, but it was still thrilling.

While talking about [Elemental Mastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elemental+Mastery), I'd like to share a nifty reader combo with the interesting Aura before delving into *Shards of Alara* (yes, I'm tinkering around with *Shards* today). Some of you may have seen it before, but it tickled my fancy. Skander brought the unwieldy [Elemental Mastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elemental+Mastery) + [Duergar Mine-Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duergar+Mine-Captain) + [Thermopod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermopod) combo to my attention. With a Mastered Mine-Captain, declare an attack, then pay two mana to untap it. Tap the Mine Captain, now a 3/1, to make three tokens, which you then sacrifice to [Thermopod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermopod) to generate enough mana to repeat the process. Eventually you'll wind up with "an infinite-power attacker and infinite mana," as Skander put it. I wanted to write about it last week due to it involving the *Coldsnap*ian [Thermopod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermopod), but wound up saving it for today.

While talking about reader mail, I'd like to clear a couple of things up. As much as you're miffed about colored artifacts not being, well, colorless, I can't do much about that. I'm just a humble bringer of wacky deck ideas (Santa Claus is known in France and Spain as Pere Noel for a reason, you know) and not a wacky designer of humble card ideas. Secondly, this isn't a much of an issue and probably is already known by everybody, but I can't respond to every email, as much as I'd like to. Two weeks ago I didn't mention that, so I am now, so we're all on the same page. I love reading mail, though, so by all means keep sending!

Qasali Quesadillas
[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Qasali+Ambusher)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Ambusher)One of the first cards to be spoiled from *Shards of Alara* was [Qasali Ambusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Ambusher), albeit through the [Visual Spoiler](/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/shardsofalara/spoiler) and not from an article preview. When we were chatting with each other on NayAOL, the Ambusher confessed, "I'm missing U." Of course, we immediately hit it off, and I promised to write about it in this column. It's only now, looking at the name tattooed on my arm, that I realize that statement may have had an alternate meaning.

Like my sudden realization, [Qasali Ambusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Ambusher) can similarly leap into play from nowhere and crush a shrimpy attacking creature. As long as you control a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), you're set to Ambush it at will. What drew me to the Ambusher was how free it was. Its mana cost is essentially "Be attacked by something." Of course, two [Cat Warriors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cat+Warriors) are better than one. And that's where [Cloudstone Curio](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudstone+Curio) comes in.

The Curio's curious (let's hear an "LOL" for that wordplay) "nonartifact" clause, seems pretty random, but it avoided potential craziness with free artifact creatures like Phyrexian Walker and [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter). Now, if you already have a [Qasali Ambusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Ambusher) in play along with the Curio, you're set for some shenanigans if a creature were to attack you. What if one did?

1. Play the second [Qasali Ambusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Ambusher) that's in your hand for free.
2. The Curio will trigger, so choose to bounce the first Ambusher.
3. Since the creature is still attacking you, you can go back to step 1.
4. Gain ridiculous amounts of life with [Soul Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden), put oodles of charge counters on a [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) (set to Cat or Warrior), put oodles of +1/+1 counters on a [Forgotten Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Ancient) to be distributed next turn, make any one creature obscenely large with [Leonin Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Battlemage) (also a Cat!), make a magnitude of mana with [Tangleroot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangleroot), or draw a surplus of cards with [Primordial Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primordial+Sage).
5. ???
6. Profit!

I didn't want to build what would basically be a slightly modified Cat + [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) deck that Chris Millar already built, however. One of the two paths ahead of me was straight-up Naya colors, which would mean a redder mana base for fun stuff like [Pandemonium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium), [Furious Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furious+Assault), and [Incite War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incite+War). While I'm all for adding red, as I think I've made abundantly clear I love doing, I'll instead go with black, and a really underused card that's been around since *Lorwyn* fits perfectly: [Faerie Tauntings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Tauntings).

Yes, apparently [Qasali Ambusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Ambusher) can appease the whims of the fae. Every time you bounce and replay the Ambushers, [Faerie Tauntings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Tauntings) will trigger and eventually your opponent will be reduced to 0 life. What makes this wacky for me is that [Faerie Tauntings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Tauntings) was meant for fluttery blue and black instants / creatures (with Faeries, they're basically the same thing.) Infinite kitty engines? Not so much.

Although they actually cost mana, other creatures with flash can trigger the Tauntings as well. I've always thought of [King Cheetah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=King+Cheetah) as sort of the poster-guy for flash, and it gets bonus points here for being a Cat. [Fleetfoot Panther](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleetfoot+Panther) would fit well as [Qasali Ambusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Ambusher)s 5-7, if it weren't Legacy-only now. Cats! [Whitemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitemane+Lion) is a perfect replacement though, as it bounces itself without the [Cloudstone Curio](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudstone+Curio)'s help. "![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif): Each opponent loses 1 life"? Since when is that white?

Kitty engines are fun and all, but straightforward instants can keep Taunting your opponent. Since our flash-y guys have a "Surprise!" theme to them, combat tricks should do the trick. One of the best to be printed recently is [Snakeform](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snakeform). Being attacked with a fat guy? Sure. Snake it and trade with your [Soul Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden).

Of course, if your opponent doesn't even attack you, infinite life loss won't be happening. [Walking Desecration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Desecration) can influence your opponent's combat decisions, and [Forbidden Orchard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Orchard) can make some creatures to attack you with. Most importantly, try not to giggle as your opponent willfully attacks, sealing his or her fate.
