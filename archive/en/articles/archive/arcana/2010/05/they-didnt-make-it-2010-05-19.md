M**agic** didn't spring fully formed from the brow of Richard Garfield. As with any game, it needed to be playtested first. With that in mind, we present another installment of "Alpha Playtest Cards." Normally we show you the playtest card (with its charmingly untemplated rules and clip-art illustration) and you guess what card it turned into. This time, though, we're presenting cards that didn't make it. And some of them appear to have handwritten rules and art, which means they were probably even more unofficial than the other unofficial playtest cards.

So look upon these cards and imagine the world in which they would have appeared. It's a shocking view into an alternate universe!
