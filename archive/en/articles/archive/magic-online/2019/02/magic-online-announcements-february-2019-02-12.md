Vintage Super League Week 5
---------------------------


VSL is entering Week 5, so don't miss your chance to get a weekly dose of ridiculously powerful *Magic* every Tuesday evening. The team-based deck-building rules and tournament structure make it even more interesting and unpredictable. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy VSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about one of *Magic*'s deepest formats!


Check it out this Tuesday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/).


Ready to start playing? [Grab a deck](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/deck-lists-magic-online-products-game-info) and join the Vintage League for matches any time or play for greater rewards with the Vintage Challenge every Saturday at 10 a.m. PT.
