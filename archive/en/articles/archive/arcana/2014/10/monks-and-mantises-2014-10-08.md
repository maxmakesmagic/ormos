In today's [Uncharted Realms](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ur/way-mantis-2014-10-08) we meet Kuhnde, one of the many monks of Jeskai and one of the few who is capable of riding a mantis. The story contains two stunning pieces of art from [Johann Bodin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+[%22Johann+Bodin%22]) ([Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider)) and [Igor Kieryluk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+[%22Igor+Kieryluk%22]) ([Highspire Mantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highspire+Mantis)) that made it impossible for me not to go digging around in their art descriptions for more flavor. And these cards are certainly dripping with flavor.


Mantis Rider
============


Setting: Tarkir

Of course, we've also seen what happens when a Mantis goes out on its own.


Highspire Mantis
================


Setting: Tarkir  

Clan: Jeskai  

Color: White/red creature  

Location: Jeskai mountainous location, near a fallen bell  

Action: Show a giant mantis (but with no rider). It has pale exoskeleton, fading to red in places, with its translucent wings spread open. This giant mantis perches on a hilly peak in Jeskai territory, on top of a huge, vertical bell that has fallen into the snow of the peak. (This bell should look old and in disrepair.)  

Focus: The giant mantis  

Mood: A wild and untamed bug-beast.

Until reading this, I hadn't even noticed the bell the mantis was perched on. Those kinds of details are my favorite little bits to uncover in these descriptions.


Speaking of which, while cruising the Multiverse file for other monks, I came across a number of tidbits I wanted to share.


For example, most of the monks look like they're in some stage of kicking someone's ass. Or, in this particular case, someone's fist.


Deflecting Palm
===============


Setting: Tarkir  

Clan: Jeskai  

Color: White/red spell  

Location: see below  

Action: This spell represents a Jeskai monk effortlessly stopping an enemy attack. Show Narset, the leader of the Jeskai. She is on an errand that is taking her through an enemy territory. A Mardu barbarian has tried to ambush her, throwing a powerful punch at her face, which she has simply blocked with her open palm. Her hand glows softly and the barbarian's forearm has violently broken from the force of his own punch. Narset's face is placid. This is not even an inconvenience for her.  

Focus: The action of a blocked punch breaking the attacker's arm  

Mood: You don't mess with a martial arts master.

I hadn't even caught the bones breaking on this before! Brutal.


But not everything is going smoothly for the monks on Tarkir...


Crater's Claws
==============


Setting: Tarkir  

Clan: Temur  

Color: Red spell  

Location: Frozen lake in an arctic valley  

Action: Show an enormous geyser of lava blasting up out of a frozen lake, maybe 30 feet (10m) high. The wave of lava is shaped like an arm, with three prominent, curving claws at the end, as if a massive lava elemental was reaching up out of the depths of the world and was about to savagely smash something. For scale, show a single, tiny Jeskai monk looking up at the lava claw, about to be crushed into ash.  

Focus: The huge geyser of lava  

Mood: The anger of the wilderness, about to punish mankind

Poor monk. We can't leave them like that. Instead, let's leave them doing awesome jumping kicks.


Flying Crane Technique
======================


Setting: Tarkir  

Clan: Jeskai  

Color: White/blue/red spell  

Location: Any Jeskai location  

Action: This spell represents a powerful, over-the-top martial arts move, in which several Jeskai monks all fly into the air and execute a series of acrobatic kicks and punches. Show three Jeskai warriors (perhaps a female human, a male human, and an efreet) who are executing this stunning assault. They leap fist-forward, maybe in all different body positions or maybe all united in some kind of combined attack. It looks artful—and deadly.  

Focus: The Jeskai monks' attack  

Mood: A furious attack, yet as poised and unruffled as a kung fu master at the same time.
