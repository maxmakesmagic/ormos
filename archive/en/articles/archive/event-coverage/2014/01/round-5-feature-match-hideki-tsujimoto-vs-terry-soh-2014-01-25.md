Terry has been Malaysia's stalwart Pro for the past decade. Winner of the *Magic* Invitational 2005, his is the face of [Rakdos Augermage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Augermage).


Having been on a bit of a hiatus since making the top 8 at the 2009 World Championship, Terry remains a legend on the local scene. Would this be his comeback event?


Game 1 was a thrilling exchange of massive tempo swings and evasive creatures.


After mulligans on both sides of the table, the players had different but equally effective routes to draw out of early mana woes. Hideki with [Ordeal of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Thassa) on [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker) and Terry with [Warriors' Lesson](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warriors%27+Lesson) on a pair of [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider)s.

*Hideki stuck on Islands*

[Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) netted Hideki the first tempo advantage in the race between the Thassa favoured and unblockable ([Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form)) [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker) and Terry's pair of 3/3 [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider)s.

*Terry pondering the impact of the Tempo Swing*

Terry eventually nominated [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) to takedown the sea god's champion. But Hideki had a second [Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form) and [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) to complete the race ahead.


At the end of the round, Terry pondered the optimal play when Hideki attacked a 2/4 Ordeal'd [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker) into [Traveling Philosopher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveling+Philosopher) and [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) with an Island open. He had chosen not to block as a play around [Triton Tactics](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Tactics), but on hindsight, it might have been a bluff or misplay on Hideki's part.


Game 2 saw Terry clawing back from an early mana flood after a single mulligan. [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) allowed him to stabalise at 10 life to Hideki's 16 (damage from [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider)) and [Hundred-Handed One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundred-Handed+One) apparently solidified his board position.


However, [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) copied by [Meletis Charlatan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meletis+Charlatan) demonstrated why board position is ephemeral against a blue deck and Hideki notched his second win with a team of [Sealock Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sealock+Monster), [Staunch-Hearted Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staunch-Hearted+Warrior) and the Charlatan.


**Hideki wins 2-0 and advances undefeated.**
