If you read the Twitter feeds of any of the more heavily followed **Magic** personalities this past week you are very well aware that ballots for the 2011 Pro Tour Hall of Fame class have gone out. Here is the text of the email I received as a member of the Selection Committee, a group of voters made up of people who have been writing about, observing, and shaping the Pro Tour as well as the already inducted members of the Pro Tour Hall of Fame. (There is also a Player Committee made up players who have accrued 100 pro points over the course of their careers.)

It is an impressive list of **Magic** players who have been around the Pro Tour for 10 years and managed to accumulate 100 pro points—no small task. Just ask anyone who has had the good fortune to play on the game's biggest stage. **Magic** is hard, and having sustained success against the best players from all around the world is something only a small group of players have been able to achieve.

Culling that list of players down to an infinitesimal five votes is not easy and has prompted vigorous debate on Twitter, Facebook, and just about every form of social media about how those players should be chosen. To walk you through how this year's ballot is made up I thought I would walk through each year of eligibility and which players remain on the ballot up through this year's new candidates.

Year One
There are only five players remaining from the initial ballot that was sent out in 2005. Seven players from that group have been enshrined and the rest have fallen off the ballot due to not maintaining enough voting support from the two committees. The remaining five all have strong support from various corners of the game and a case can and has been made for each of them.

Both Steven O'Mahoney-Schwartz and Chris Pikula have been within mere votes of being enshrined—and truth be told, they have likely each indirectly hindered others' chances of getting into the Hall of Fame by being from the same era and splitting votes. There seems to be a groundswell for [Pro Tour Los Angeles 1999](http://archive.wizards.com/sideboard/article.asp?x=PTLA9899/welcome) Champion O'Mahoney-Schwartz, as many of his famous friends have been campaigning for him to get in. It is worth noting that among the eligible players on this year's ballot Steve OMS is 5th in lifetime Pro Points—and this having played in an era when those points were incredibly hard to come by. There were fewer events and the payouts were not nearly as deep.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/twtw/twtw152_players01.jpg)  
Scott Johns has more Pro Tour Top 8 appearances than anyone on the ballot and certainly has the contributions to the game component of eligibility nailed down tight, serving for years as the editor of **MagicTheGathering.com**. Mark Justice had a brief career with unbelievable numbers and was one of the first superstars of the game. While both of these players garner enough support to remain on the ballot they would seem like slam-dunk candidates, but it is clear that early results on the Pro Tour—when players built [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) decks with fewer than the maximum number of the eponymous enchantment and had decks that teetered over the 60-card recommendation—are not held in the highest regard by the combined committees.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/twtw/twtw152_players02.jpg)  
No player has generated more forum pages each year during the existence of the Hall of Fame than Mike Long. His supporters and detractors are collide every year, and while he has remained on the ballot, his detractors seem to be drowning out the other side.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/twtw/twtw152_players03.jpg)  
Before we move on: **Magic** creator Richard Garfield asked me to share this open letter regarding one of the Year 1 players on the 2011 ballot.

**An Open Letter to the **Magic** Community, and in particular voters for the **Magic** Pro Tour Hall of Fame**I have enjoyed seeing the ranks of the Hall of Fame grow, and been proud to be a part of the process. I think the folk chosen have been of exceptional quality, and represent more than just play skill but also innovation and community contributions. When different folk are chosen than I would have chosen if I were the sole voter, I am usually pretty happy with the chosen folk as well and accept those differences as legitimate differences of opinion.

However, there is one oversight that I have felt pain over year after year. Every year I vote for Mark Justice and every year I know that vote is thrown away. For those who were around and active when he was dominant, you know what a force he was. He was a champion, the best at the time with very little dispute. For those that weren't around, well, we have done you a disservice for not putting him in the Hall of Fame where he deserves to be, and we are losing a piece of our history because of it. The man was a **Magic** titan, the player all other players were measured against.

I have heard the argument that the current players are better. That carries no weight with me at all. In other Halls of Fame—baseball, football, basketball—there are players who wouldn't even be able to play professionally today who are there because of their prowess during their age. Even more than sports, games build a knowledge base which current players can leverage against older players. If a strong chess player were sent back in time 50 years they would dominate because of the extra knowledge available to them. That a player today can beat Mark Justice means nothing unless they can somehow do it using just the knowledge that was available at the time.

Use one of your votes to honor our history.

Richard Garfield

| Year 1 |
| Hall of Famers | On 2011 Ballot  |
| Alan Comer  | Scott Johns  |
| Robert Dougherty  | Mark Justice  |
| Jon Finkel  | Michael Long  |
| David Humpherys  | Steven O'Mahoney-Schwartz  |
| Tommi Hovi  | Chris Pikula  |
| Darwin Kastle |  |
| Olle Råde  |  |

  
Year Two
Four players who began their careers in the second year of the Pro Tour have been enshrined, and five remain eligible. Most notable among them is Patrick Chapin, who smashes the community component of Hall of Fame eligibility out of the park but would have fallen off the ballot this past season if not for continued Pro Tour activity. Oh, by the way, that activity included him making the Top 8 of [Pro Tour Paris](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptpar11/welcome), the fourth Top 8 of his career in the adult division. (Chapin had a previous Top 8 in a competitive youth championship called the Junior Super Series.)

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/twtw/twtw152_players04.jpg)  
Justin Gary is another player who gets bandied about with the likes of Chris Pikula and Steven O'Mahoney-Schwartz as veteran players with great resumes who deserve a closer look, especially from voters who may not have seen them at their height. Justin has three Top 8s, including his win at [Pro Tour Houston](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=sideboard/events/pthou02), and, perhaps more compellingly, made the Top 32 fifteen times—just over a third of the fourty-four events he played in during his career.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/twtw/twtw152_players05.jpg)  
Alex Shvartsman always gets some support based on his trailblazing as the original Grand Prix Road Warrior and his staggering number of Grand Prix Top 8 appearances. Alex is, of course, held back by only having one Pro Tour Top 8 on his resume. Rounding out the remaining year two players are Noah Boeken and Gerardo Godinez Estrada, both of whom were reinstated to the ballot after playing on the Pro Tour this past season.

| Year 2 |

| Raphael Levy  | Noah Boeken  |
| Robert Maher Jr.  | Patrick Chapin  |
| Joseph Gary Wise  | Justin Gary  |
| Bram Snepvangers  | Gerardo Godinez Estrada  |
|  | Alex Shvartsman  |

  
Year Three
This is what they call a very good year. There are eight players from this group already inducted. You may recall this was the contentious ballot with seven slam-dunk candidates vying for five inductions. It took two seasons to get them all in, but from Kai Budde to Ben Rubin, they all got their rings. Brian Kibler came back from retirement to further improve the reputation of the vintage and was enshrined last season after his win at [Pro Tour Austin](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptaus09/welcome).

Had that last match in Austin between Kibler and Tsuyoshi Ikeda played out differently, it could very well have been Ikeda who earned that honor—an honor that very well may still be coming his way. When you look at the players who have racked up more than 300 points in their careers, the only ones not in the Hall of Fame are Shuhei Nakamura, who is a clear favorite during this, his first season of eligibility; Tomoharu Saito, who was voted in but barred from entry when he was suspended; and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, who is not eligible for another year.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/twtw/twtw152_players07.jpg)  
Rounding out the stragglers from that class are [**Magic Online** Championship Series](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/worlds09/feature/mocs3) competitor Robert Jurkovic, who just crossed the 100-point threshold this past season and is in his first year of eligibility. [Worlds 2008](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/worlds08/welcome) finalist Jamie Parke and World Series of Poker finalist David Williams are the others and are both likely a big finish or two away from being very much in the mix.

| Nicolai Herzog  | David Williams  |
| Zvi Mowshowitz  |  |
| Ben Rubin  |  |
| Michael Turian  |  |
| Brian Kibler |  |

  
Year Four
William "Baby Huey" Jensen has always kept a low profile, and does not have the peripheral community aspect that many other candidates have. Nonetheless, support for him seems to be picking up steam, and when the likes of Jon Finkel declare him one of the five best players to ever play on the Pro Tour, people tend to take notice and look over the stats. Eivind Nitter and Carlos Romão face an uphill battle to get more than regional support for the candidacy due to their low number of Top 8s, but Jensen support is coming from all corners. He has four PT Top 8s, including his win at [Pro Tour Boston](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=sideboard/events/ptbos03) as a member of The Brockafellers, has a Masters Series win, and won a pair of Grand Prix in eight Top 8 attempts.

| Hall of Famers | On 2011 Ballot  |
| Dirk Baberowski  | William Jensen  |
| Olivier Ruel  | Eivind Nitter  |
| Jelger Wiegersma  | Carlos Romão  |

  
Year Five
Players will not start falling off the 2009 ballot until after this year's votes are tallied, so all but the three enshrined players remain eligible, with the addition of Singapore's Albertus Law, who got to the triple-digit plateau in pro points with his recent finish at [Grand Prix Singapore](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpsin11/welcome), and Taiwan's Tzu Ching Kuo.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/twtw/twtw152_players10.jpg)  
Notable players from that class include Eric Froehlich and Ben Stark, who have both put up Top 8 finishes since the last votes were tallied, Eric making Top 8 at [Worlds](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/worlds10/welcome) last year and Ben winning [Pro Tour Paris](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptpar11/welcome). Antonino De Rosa came close last season, and the smiling Italian may have charmed some more voters with his recent appearance at [Pro Tour Nagoya](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptnag11/welcome).

| Year 5 |
| Hall of Famers | On 2011 Ballot  |
| Kamiel Cornelissen  | Jose Barbero  |
| Frank Karsten  | Tiago Chan  |
| Antoine Ruel  | Tzu Ching Kuo  |
|  | Jeff Cunningham  |
|  | Brian Davis  |
|  | Antonino De Rosa  |
|  | Eric Froehlich  |
|  | Kazuya Hirabayashi  |
|  | Mike Hron  |
|  | Mattias Kettil  |
|  | Albertus Law  |
|  | Antoine Menard  |
|  | Chikara Nakajima  |
|  | Rickard Osterberg  |
|  | Diego Ostrovich  |
|  | Mario Pascoli  |
|  | Ben Stark  |
|  | Helmut Summersberger  |
|  | Jens Thorén  |

  
Year Six
Again, this class features lots of players still laying around who will be vying for support until players from this class start falling off after next year's ballot. Only Gabriel Nassif has been enshrined from among players who started playing at the beginning of this millennium, but Anton Jonsson seems like he is very much in the mix for voters this year. With five Top 8s, a reputation as one of the game's great Limited players, and a successful writing career, he stands out in the crowd.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/twtw/twtw152_players12.jpg)  
You can add Eugene Harvey to the scrum of players, a couple of whom are coming onto the ballot this year, with similar resumes looking to distinguish themselves from the pack. He has some great numbers—such as making the Top 16 of a PT seven times in thirty-three attempts—and was incredibly important to the careers of many of the great players from the era in which he was active, but is singularly untalented at tooting his own horn and is likely to be overlooked by many voters.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/twtw/twtw152_players13.jpg)  
When you look through the ranks of the players who have won Player of the Year, the only players with sufficient service time but no Hall of Fame ring are Paul McCabe, Tomoharu Saito, and Shouta Yasooka. Staggeringly, McCabe does not meet the Pro Points eligibility requirement, with only 75 points and Saito had the honor slip from his fingers. Shouta has only one Pro Tour Top 8—which he won—on his resume which is certainly a glaring lack of experience. I just want to point out that Shouta is recently reinvigorated, and with the four points he picked up for his [Nationals](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/jpnat11/welcome) Top 8 this past weekend he is now in fifth place for this year's title. It is hard to imagine him winning the title this year without another Top 8 coming his way. Would two Pro Tour Top 8s and two Player of the Year titles get him into the Hall next season?

|  |

| Year 6 |
| Hall of Famers | On 2011 Ballot  |
| Gabriel Nassif  | Akira Asahara  |
|  | Jan Doise  |
|  | Willy Edel  |
|  | Eugene Harvey  |
|  | Ken Ho  |
|  | Richard Hoaen  |
|  | Anton Jonsson  |
|  | Shu Komuro  |
|  | Antti Malin  |
|  | Quentin Martin  |
|  | Katsuhiro Mori  |
|  | Masahiko Morita  |
|  | Ryo Ogura  |
|  | Jeroen Remie  |
|  | Johan Sadeghpour  |
|  | Jonathan Sonne  |
|  | Ruud Warmenhoven  |
|  | Shouta Yasooka  |

  
Year Seven
Like last season's ballot with Gabriel Nassif, there is only one slam-dunk that almost the entire social network of **Magic** seems to agree upon, and that is that Shuhei Nakamura and his 400+ pro points are going to be enshrined at the top of this year's class. The fact that Shuhei is eligible this year means he is averaging 40 points per season over his career, although it seems more like 80 points a season for the past five.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/twtw/twtw152_players15.jpg)  
He has five Top 8s and has advanced to at least the semifinals in all but one of them. He has won the Player of the Year title and traveled around the world smashing Grand Prix in just about every time zone. He is also one of the most consistent players in the game. Pretty much half the time that he plays in a Pro Tour he finishes in the Top 64. He makes the Top 32 once every four tries and a Top 16 once every six times he has played. Slam. Dunk.

I have talked about the collection of players with similar resumes a couple of times, and grappling at the heart of that scrum are Osyp Lebedowicz and Mark Herberholz. Their resumes perfectly illustrate the dilemma faced by voters, assuming that these were two players on the bubble of a ballot.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/twtw/twtw152_players16.jpg)  
Both players have a Pro Tour win in their careers: Osyp in [Venice](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=sideboard/events/ptven03) over Tomi Walamies and Herberholz in [Honolulu](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/pthon06/welcome) over Craig Jones. They are both incredibly well respected deck designers and players. Osyp has a slight edge in the community department, as he was a regular writer when he was playing the game, but Herberholz also wrote about the game and recently showed off his storytelling ability in a well-timed memoir on StarCityGames.com.

Herberholz holds the edge when it comes to the number of Top 8s with four to Osyp's three, but Osyp was clearly a more consistent Pro Tour finisher—you only need to read Heezy's aforementioned memoirs to understand why—with a Top 32 finish around a third of the time he played on the Tour. Herberholz was Top 8 or bust, with only one other Top 32 to go with his four Top 8s. They are both compelling candidates... and then you throw in Steve OMS, Pikula, William Jensen, Eugene Harvey, Justin Gary, Ben Stark, Paul Rietzl, and so on, and you get something of an American logjam that makes it hard to get one or more of them downriver.

| Year 7 |
| Hall of Famers | On 2011 Ballot  |
|  | Benjamin Caumes  |
|  | Gerard Fabiano  |
|  | Sam Gomersall  |
|  | Mark Herberholz  |
|  | Osyp Lebedowicz  |
|  | Koutarou Ootsuka  |
|  | Shuhei Nakamura  |
|  | Paul Rietzl  |
|  | Geoffrey Siron  |
|  | Amiel Tenenbaum  |
|  | Gabe Walls  |
|  | Stuart Wright  |
|  | Arnost Zidek  |

  
Looking Ahead
Looking at next year's class, I see a slam-dunk contest that is going to make it tough on any candidates still lingering after the current ballot is tallied. Who will take down the slam-dunk title? Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, Kenji Tsumura, or the quietly amazing Masashi Oiso?

The year after that we see Luis Scott-Vargas, Gadiel Szleifer, and Martin Juza as the most likely inductees. Beyond that there are players who have already locked up their eligibility through the year 2016, when we see a class of Owen Turtenwald, Gaudenis Vidugiris, and Yuuya Watanabe waiting to see if we remember them five years from now.

The class of 2017 is still waiting for a student to cross the 100-point threshold, but, amazingly, there is already someone ready for the 2018 class of the Pro Tour Hall of Fame: Brad Nelson. What a FFfreaK!
