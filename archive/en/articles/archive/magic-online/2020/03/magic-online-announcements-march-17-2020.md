Surprise! *Vintage Cube*!
-------------------------


You asked, and we responded (or, rather, [we asked](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline/status/1238221299727491072), and you responded)! With some of us having some extra at-home time to fill, the *Vintage Cube* is back for two weeks starting tomorrow and running until April 1. This encore presentation is the same cube we ran back in December and January, so we don't have a change list to publish.


To make room for the *Vintage Cube*, we've moved the *Invasion* Block Flashback Draft to April 29 and delayed the start of the *Modern Cube* to April 1. We're aware that some *Invasion* Block fans may be disappointed by the change, so we'll explore some ways to spice up the event when it does launch.


Thanks, and good luck in your leagues.
