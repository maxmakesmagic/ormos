This past weekend, we unveiled a lot of information about *Battle for Zendikar* at PAX Prime. Like, *a lot* a lot. Ulamog, Gideon, all of the mechanics, and the truly gorgeous *Zendikar Expeditions* were all shown off, and the response was electric.


Today's news is a bit less earth-shattering, but it's still the newest nugget of information about the set that's soon to fly off shelves. Today we have the *Battle for Zendikar* packaging, plus a couple preview cards just for tuning in.


First, we have the booster packs, and first up on the booster packs is the baddest Demon Planeswalker this side of the Multiverse.

Next up is a familiar-looking Merfolk. Kiora, is that you?

Next up we have this . . . thing. It's an Eldrazi I presume, but man is that thing terrifying.

Back on the other end of the normal/weird scale, we have a creature that might look familiar to anyone who has picked up *Duel Decks: Zendikar vs. Eldrazi*—Veteran Warleader!

Finally, we have a mug you should start getting used to. Gideon's all over *Battle for Zendikar*, and boy does he have his determined face on.

The boosters can all be picked up in booster boxes that look a little like this. Look, more Gideon!

And, of course, we have the Fat Pack as well, with Gideon looking pretty menacing in the foreground, and facing off against Ulamog in the background.

Taking a break from Gideon, *Battle for Zendikar* will also have an Event Deck! This one looks a little something like this:

Which brings us to the Intro Packs. We showed off four of the face cards at PAX, but we figure we might as well just show off all five today. Because we like you.

Let's take a better look at the one face card you haven't seen.

You can get all of these, together with so, *so much* Gideon determined-face staring back at you, when *Battle for Zendikar* releases October 2. And come back next week as previews for the set kick into high gear!
