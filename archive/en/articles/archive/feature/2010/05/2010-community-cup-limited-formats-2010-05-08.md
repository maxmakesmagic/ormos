The 2010 Community Cup is just about a month away and we thought it was high time to share the Community Cup limited formats with everyone. For the draft format, we will polish off our artifacts and play *Mirrodin* block. For the sealed deck format, we will play *Rise of the Eldrazi* and summon some astral monstrosities to annihilate each other with, though we will incorporate a slight twist and preview our new sealed format. 

 And if you haven't checked out your [Community Team profile](/en/articles/archive/magic-online-community-cup-2010-04-30) yet, what are you waiting for? These nine players are putting their pride on the line for you, so take a minute to get to know them a little better. When you are done, head over to the [**Magic Online** Group forum](http://community.wizards.com/magiconline/go/forum/view/76117/136553/general_group_discussion), wish them luck, and contribute to the various strategy discussions so you can help them win! 

 Oh… and if you need some incentive, how about this: If the Community Team wins, we will give everyone who contributes to any of the 2010 Community Cup threads in the MTGO group forums a free *Mirrodin* Block draft set, along with someplace to use it! That's right, free draft! 

 If—we mean when—the Community Team loses, however, fret not. Everyone who participates will still receive a free [Sorrow's Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorrow%2527s%2BPath)! 

 Don't forget to look out for additional content from your Community Team, like [Brad](http://strategy.channelfireball.com/featured-articles/fffreaky-friday-post-rise-gauntlet-and-the-community-cup/) and [Ed](http://www.robotviking.com/2010/04/20/robot-viking-invited-to-magic-online-community-cup-2010/).
