Happy 66th!


Wait a second, isn't this *Magic*'s 25th birthday? What's up with 66?

Here is the complete list of each and every Grand Prix to have taken place in Japan, 65 to date, the 66th being today's Grand Prix Chiba. Not only do we celebrate *Magic*'s 25th year, we also honor the Japan and its *Magic* community for being one of the strongest nations the game has ever seen.

Additionally, together with the dauntless efforts of Japanese coverage team, we sought out and spoke to 32 Grand Prix Champions who won their Grand Prix titles in Japan. To be more specific, these names are arranged chronologically, based on the date where they achieved victory in Japan – some of these esteemed individuals might have won a Grand Prix outside of Japan before they won a Grand Prix within Japan.


We have them share their thoughts about winning their first Grand Prix, and also what they feel about about future of *Magic*. We hope that this gives you a walk through time and space so you can further appreciate the rich history of our wonderful game and community.


Special thanks to Masashi Koyama, Genki Moriyasu, and Seo Asako for their collective efforts in making this tribute possible.

As a student, it was a lot of money and that was how I ended up playing *Magic* professionally. That [Demonfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire) changed my life."

Collectively, the words from these individuals meld together to represent one of the strongest voices in the world. Such spirit originates from their deep cultural roots of maintaining a peaceful unity and conformity within a social group, where members prefer the continuation of a harmonious community over their personal interests. Japan has inspired us to become strong and united as they are and to keep marching forward towards perfection.
