Holger,


I received all the letters I wrote you, unopened. Why have you shunned me so? I know about your condition, and I do not care. I want my husband back — your children want their father! I know you think you are protecting us, but at least break this curse of silence and write to me!


The common wisdom is that there is no cure for werewolves. But who are we to make such definitive statements, when so much in our world remains undiscovered?


I have scoured the library, and have made as many inquiries as I dare, and have come up with a possibility. There is a church in Kessig that is rumored to be harboring werewolves, giving them shelter and also looking for a cure! I beg you, find your way to Ereschstag, for it is believed to be there. They have not yet found a cure, but if you would only stay there perhaps you can benefit from their research.


You see, my love? This need not be the end of our story. There is hope.


Hope is all we have. My hope of seeing you again helps me to keep a brave face for our children.


Your Adalee
