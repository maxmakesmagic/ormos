Let's talk about your PS3 Home space. (If you have one. If you don't have one, you can at least look at some pretty pictures.) Anyway, your Home space. Do you think it's cool enough? Does it, for example, resemble a huge, cool castle, brimming with **Magic** statues, art, and minigames?

The **Magic: The Gathering**-themed Home space is coming on February 10. It provides the perfect place to hang out and feel **Magic**-y. And there are minigames scattered around your new castle that reward you with **Magic** apparel for your avatar.

Of course, if you're more results-oriented, there are also game-relevant things around. Like the **Duels of the Planeswalkers** leaderboards, tastefully displayed within the Home space. In fact, you can even launch **Duels of the Planeswalkers** directly from this space.

As a special bonus, if you pick it up right away on February 10, you'll be able to meet and mingle with Wizards of the Coast staff and special guests. Exciting!

If you don't have a PlayStation 3, or if you have one but aren't up on all the details, you might be wondering at this point what the PlayStation Home is. Boiled down to its essence, it's a place where PlayStation Network users can create a custom avatar, groom it realistically, and decorate their personal apartments. And inside Home, there are Spaces. This is one of those. Clear? Good! Here, look at this snippet of a video.
