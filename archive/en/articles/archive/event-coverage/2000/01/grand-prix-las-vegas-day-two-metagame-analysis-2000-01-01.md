Here's what made it to Day 2:


10 Donate  

9 Junk  

7 Walamies  

5 Three-Deuce  

4 BUG  

3 Stasis  

3 Sligh  

3 The Rock and his Millions  

3 Turboland  

2 Secret Force  

2 Green-Blue Control  

1 Miracle Grow  

1 Countersliver  

1 Wild Zombies  

1 Threshold Geddon  

1 Enchantress  

1 Finkula  

1 Five-color green  

1 Instant.dec  

1 Oath  

1 Tinker  

1 Samurai-jack  

1 Life


Basically, Donate came in as the most played deck, though it was only 13%. It was still the most played deck on day 2 and in fact made up a slightly higher percentage of the field. However, you can already see the green decks (especially the green-black deck) starting their charge up the standings. By the time day 2 ended there wasn't a single Donate anywhere in the Top 16 or a single blue card anywhere in the Top 8. The Top 8 was all green decks: 2 Junk decks, 2 copies of the Rock and his millions, 2 Three-Deuce, one Wild Zombies, and one Threshold-Geddon.


The tournament was summed up well by the performance of Alan Comer. He showed up with a neat new anti-Donate deck (called Miracle Grow) that could become a fixture at upcoming qualifiers because it does such a good job of smashing Donate. However, by the end of day 2 he found himself above all the Donate decks in the standings and got edged out of the Top 8 by decks that were a bit more flexible.


Your guess is s good as mine as to what happens to Extended now and if you guess right, you get to go to Osaka.
