Hello everybody! Today I'm digging around in the Tolarian Academy for some more paper, since I seem to have used up all of mine writing out the changelog for the rules and Oracle. *Dominaria* was a big one. Luckily there are entire libraries of abandoned arcane lore, just waiting for me to scrub off the ink so I can write more notes.


We had four major templating changes that [you can read about here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/dominaria-frame-template-and-rules-changes-2018-03-21). This resulted in around 3,400 cards receiving errata. But I know you, dear readers. You care about nitty-gritty details and weird quirky changes, not just the big splashy ones.


In addition to rules changes to support those changes, we've made a whole suite of smaller fixups in addition to the necessary additions to make *Dominaria* cards work. Don't miss the huge Two-Headed Giant changeâ€”it's been somewhat muffled by the louder changes that impact Standard and Modern, but it's a thing.


This is also the first update bulletin with a silver lining. Some of you may tremble in fear, but rest assured that black-bordered world is safe from Rosewater's argentum machinations. Yes, silver-bordered cards will be mentioned as having received errata in my articles from here on, as those cards are now maintained and updated like their black-bordered cousins.


You can find the [Comprehensive Rules here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) on our website, and Oracle text updated in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/). Keep in mind that this article was written before the rules changes were finalized in editing, so there may be minor deviations from what I describe below.
