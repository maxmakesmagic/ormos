![Iname as One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Iname+as+One)**[Iname as One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iname+as+One)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* rare. [Iname as One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iname+as+One) is a combination of [Iname, Death Aspect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iname%2C+Death+Aspect) and [Iname, Life Aspect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iname%2C+Life+Aspect) from *Champions of Kamigawa*: the casting cost, power, and toughness are all literally the sum of the other two cards. But the ability was new!
 ![Svogthos, the Restless Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Svogthos%2C+the+Restless+Tomb)**[Svogthos, the Restless Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Svogthos%2C+the+Restless+Tomb)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* uncommon. Svogthos was once an Orzhov cathedral, but the Golgari took it over for their guild hall and brought it to life. According to rumor, whenever the center of Golgari territory shifts, Svogthos itself moves to follow.
 ![Savra, Queen of the Golgari ](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Savra%2C+Queen+of+the+Golgari+)**[Savra, Queen of the Golgari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savra%2C+Queen+of+the+Golgari+)**  – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* rare. When the story of *Ravnica: City of Guilds* opened, [Savra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savra) had just taken the throne from the [Sisters of Stone Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sisters+of+Stone+Death), a trio of gorgons that had been the guild's oracles and rulers for over a century.
 ![Lotleth Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lotleth+Troll)**[Lotleth Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotleth+Troll)** – *Return to Ravnica* rare. The Lotleth are the Golgari's irregular faction of undead, necromancers, fungus-binders, and other members associated with the restless dead. Although most Golgari undead are mindless fungal constructions maintained by necromantic magic, the Lotleth do have some more or less intelligent undead among them, plus a few higher-ranked necromancers who speak for the faction.
 ![Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jarad%2C+Golgari+Lich+Lord)**[Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jarad%2C+Golgari+Lich+Lord)** – *Return to Ravnica* mythic rare. Jarad Vod Savo was an elvish archer, brother to the Golgari’s previous leader: [Savra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savra). Jarad ended up sacrificing himself to protect his son from [Rakdos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=107438), then through necromancy brought himself back to life to reign over Golgari after his sister’s demise. As an undead lich necromancer, he has the power to hold onto the position of Golgari guldmaster.
 ![Mythic Proportions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mythic+Proportions)**[Mythic Proportions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mythic+Proportions)** – *Onslaught* rare. The Card of the Day for Monday was [**Common** Bond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Common+Bond), and it's a common. The card for Tuesday was [**Rare**-B-Gone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rare-B-Gone), and it's a rare. Which is kind of self-contradictory. Anyway, [Mythic Proportions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mythic+Proportions) has the word "mythic" in its name, but it predates mythic rares, so it doesn't really fit. Sorry! (And also sorry to [Common Cause](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Common+Cause) and [Common Courtesy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Common+Courtesy), which also don't fit.)
 ![Rare-B-Gone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rare-B-Gone)**[Rare-B-Gone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rare-B-Gone)** – *Unhinged* rare. When we planned *Unhinged* previews back in 2004, we thought we were pretty clever with [Rare-B-Gone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rare-B-Gone). What could be a better place to preview a rare-destroying card than [Building on a Budget](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/building-budget-comes-unhinged-2004-11-12)? Even eight years later, that still seems like the right idea!
 ![Common Bond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Common+Bond)**[Common Bond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Common+Bond)** – *Return to Ravnica* common. [Common Bond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Common+Bond) shows a wolf and its elf rider. Their magical connection is shown by the glowing green eyes they both have.
 ![Jhoira of the Ghitu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jhoira+of+the+Ghitu)**[Jhoira of the Ghitu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhoira+of+the+Ghitu)** – *Future Sight* rare. Jhoira was captain of the [*Weatherlight*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weatherlight) before [Sisay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sisay), which is why [Jhoira's Toolbox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhoira%27s+Toolbox) was a card back in *Urza's Legacy*. The temporal shenanigans of *Time Spiral* block let Jhoira come back into the **Magic** storyline to team up with [Teferi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=121271), [Karn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=9847), and [Venser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=136209) and seal up the rifts.
 ![96867](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=96867)**[Izzet Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=96867)** – *Guildpact* common. Most of the guild symbols were changed a little between the original *Ravnica* block and the current one. Jeremy Jarvis went over each of the changes [in this article](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/214a), but one of the symbols has a canonical in-game reason for being updated! According to [Izzet Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=96867), Niv-Mizzet frequently changes the guild's logo to make himself look better.
 ![96952](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=96952)**[Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=96952)** – *Guildpact* rare. The first appearance of Niv-Mizzet, the smartest living thing on the plane of Ravnica, was in *Guildpact* and featured this unusual flavor text:
 *"(Z–)90º – (E–N²W)90ºt = 1"*





![Frostburn Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Frostburn+Weird)**[Frostburn Weird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird)** – *Return to Ravnica* common. The "Weird" is a creature type introduced in *Guildpact* with [Gelectrode](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=96891), [Petrahydrox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=96897), and [Steamcore Weird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=97201). It's an artificial creature specific to the Izzet guild!
 


![Niv-Mizzet, Dracogenius](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Niv-Mizzet%2C+Dracogenius)**[Niv-Mizzet, Dracogenius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niv-Mizzet%2C+Dracogenius)** – *Return to Ravnica* mythic rare. Although Niv-Mizzet is the leader (and namesake) of the Izzet, he rarely concerns himself with day-to-day operations. Instead, Niv-Mizzet concentrates on elaborate long-range plans while his personal court (the Izmundi) keep him informed on the outside world.
 


![114918](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=114918)**[Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=114918)** – *Time Spiral* common. This card points towards one of **Magic**'s original cards: [Royal Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin). [Royal Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin) taps to [Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate), get it?
 


![39932](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=39932)**[Arcanis the Omnipotent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=39932)** – *Onslaught* rare. His first ability is a reference to the very powerful [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall), a spell that any omnipotent mage would feel obliged to keep handy.
 


![Archon of the Triumvirate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Archon+of+the+Triumvirate)**[Archon of the Triumvirate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+the+Triumvirate)** – *Return to Ravnica* rare. Archon was the title of the chief magistrate in ancient Athens; in **Magic** it has come to represent a humanoid being riding atop a winged animal. [Archon of the Triumvirate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+the+Triumvirate) is the first of **Magic**'s Archons to be multicolored. 
 


![General Jarkeld](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=General+Jarkeld)**[General Jarkeld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=General+Jarkeld)** – *Ice Age* rare. Halvor Arenson, on [Lost Order of Jarkeld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lost+Order+of+Jarkeld), tells us that [General Jarkeld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=General+Jarkeld) and his troops died in the [Adarkar Wastes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Wastes).
 


![1848](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1848)**[Ebon Praetor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1848)** – *Fallen Empires* rare. The idea of power-and-toughness-altering counters on creatures was introduced in *Fallen Empires*. They've been reduced to just +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters, but originally there were all sorts of configurations, like [Ebon Praetor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ebon+Praetor)'s -2/-2 and +1/+0 counters. *Duelist #4* had a convenient punch-out sheet of the *Fallen Empires* counters, and you can [see it here](/en/articles/archive/fallen-empires-tokens-2009-04-29).
 


![Jedit Ojanen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jedit+Ojanen)**[Jedit Ojanen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jedit+Ojanen)** – *Legends* common. For a common vanilla legend, [Jedit Ojanen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jedit+Ojanen) has left quite a legacy. The second book of the second *Legends* trilogy was about Jedit Ojanen. There were two comic books called "Legend of Jedit Ojanen" in 1996. An alternate Jedit even returned in *Planar Chaos* as [Jedit Ojanen of Efrava](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jedit+Ojanen+of+Efrava).
 


![Azorius Ã†thermage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Azorius+%C3%86thermage)**[Azorius Æthermage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+%C3%86thermage)** – *Dissension* uncommon. There are three references to Æthermages in **Magic**. Two of them ([Æthermage's Touch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86thermage%27s+Touch) and [Azorius Æthermage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+%C3%86thermage)) are in *Dissension* and are obviously set on Ravnica. The third is [Vedalken Æthermage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+%C3%86thermage) from *Future Sight* and depicts a two-armed Vedalken. It *could* be Ravnica!
