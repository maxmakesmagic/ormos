The June 24, 2016 Update
========================



 Posted in **Daily Magic Update**
 on June 24, 2016

By Blake Rasmussen




Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on June 24, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by BoREXIT—the Boros guild's decision to leave the Guildpact. Also, by terrible and overwrought political jokes.


Today's Must
============


1. [Choosing Your Mode](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13352&writer=Craig+Wescoe&articledate=6-24-2016) | TCGPlayer | Craig Wescoe

Wescoe is all-in on this teaching thing, and he delivers another fine piece today that discusses the different "modes" of *Magic* and how you should play and act in each one. The right play in one scenario might not be the right play in another.


Except playing [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter). That's always the correct play.


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [StarCityGames.com Dallas Open Weekend](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/250616_dallas_fact_sheet.html)

Tom Ross can't win them all, especially as the Open series takes on Modern this weekend in Dallas. Coverage of the two-day Modern tournament will be broadcast on [twitch.tv/scglive](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive) starting at 11:30 a.m. ET/8:30 a.m. PT, featuring Matthias Hunt and Ryan Overturf in the commentary booth.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Introducing the 2016 Gamers Helping Gamers Scholarship Recipients](http://www.fetchland.com/3351-2/) | Fetchland | Brian David-Marshall

Games Helping Gamers is a scholarship program started by *Magic* players for *Magic* players to give them a leg-up in life by providing four-year and one-year scholarships. This year's recipients also happen to include a certain frontrunner for the Pro Tour Rookie of the Year. So he's having a good year.


Read about these three accomplished players and scholars by clicking above.


1. [Top 5 *Eldritch Moon* Predictions for *Magic: The Gathering*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEh4EOzJcAE) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

The Professor looks a little GQ as he makes five predictions about *Eldritch Moon*, of which he got [censored] correct. Way to go! Or maybe not! Find out over the next few weeks.

1. [Vintage 101: Eternally Extravagant](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/vintage-101-eternally-extravagant) | MTGGoldfish | Islandswamp

It has happened. The Eldrazi have infected every format, now even taking over Vintage. And not, like, one Eldrazi is seeing some kind of semi-fruitful play. Full-on, unpowered Eldrazi decks that are close to Legacy legal, are actually winning. Those that do deign to play Moxen are doing well as well.


It's not our world. It's Eldrazi all the way down.


1. [Emrakul, the Promised End and the Beginning of Spoiler Season](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/emrakul-the-promised-end/) | Top Level Podcast | Mike Flores and Patrick Chapin

Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores start churning their brewing gears with Emrakul, the Promised End (while I mix my metaphors). Who knew that Emrakul and Sorin could be such good friends?


1. [*Shadows over Innistrad* EDH/Commander Deck Tech Spotlight for *Magic: The Gathering*!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMPQM3eJ9AA) | The Mana Source | Wedge

Hey everyone, check out this Commander spotlight, looking at how to best use *Shadows over Innistrad* Legends. And the answer is not "feed them to Emrakul, who we all worship now."

1. [Oh Snap](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/thegirlfriendbracket-06242016-the-girlfriend-bracket-60-oh-snap/) | The Girlfriend Bracket | Erin Campbell, Hallie Santo, Katie Neal, and Kriz Schultz

The crew discusses the Wizards of the Coast coverage meeting (Hi, Hallie!), Melissa DeTora coming back to Wizards (Hi, Melissa!), and Emrakul's big re-debut (Hi, Emrakul!).


What People Are Talking About

So Hanweir was simply poorly planned and over-cooked? Makes sense. No Emrakul here. Everyone can go home.

Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Vintage Unpowered Eldrazi](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/vintage-101-eternally-extravagant)

I don't normally like to step on decks featured in articles that are also in the update, but this one just felt like it needed to be highlighted even more, because it's the Holy Grail of people who want to play Vintage but can't seem to find a [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) just lying around—the truly unpowered, competitive Vintage deck.


There's one catch: You have to side with the Eldrazi.


Mark Hornung recently took second place at the Eternal Extravaganza ([as detailed on MTGGoldfish](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/vintage-101-eternally-extravagant)) with a deck that played zero Moxen, blue cards, [Sol Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring), [Mana Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Crypt)—nothing. Instead, the deck is all [Strip Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strip+Mine)/[Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s and multilands to help cast Eldrazi—[Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), [Eldrazi Temple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple), and [Eye of Ugin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin).


So how does it get away without playing the artifact mana that defines the format? With [Null Rod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Null+Rod), the ultimate equalizer (and also some of the best flavor text around). [Warping Wail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warping+Wail) helps keep things under control, while the rest of the Eldrazi crew gets to smash hard.


It just goes to show how much Vintage has to offer if you look for it. And if you have reality-warping, otherworldly creatures on your side.
