**Card of the Day - mardi 31 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Demonic%20Consultation)#### Demonic Consultation


 *Ice Age* uncommon. Originally derided as terrible and later vindicated as incredible, Mark Justice made a famous game-losing blunder with this card in the finals of the ’96 World Championships. 


**Card of the Day - lundi 30 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mind%20Twist)#### Mind Twist

 Alpha rare. Alexander Blumke of Switzerland won the World Championships in ’95 with Mind Twist in his deck. It was the last Worlds to allow this card in constructed play. 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 27 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Volcanic%20Island)#### Volcanic Island

 Beta rare. At first many players saw blue-red as an awkward combination. However, as blue became increasingly popular, Volcanic Island increased in popularity as well, giving you access to your own blue spells as well as Red Elemental Blast and Pyroblast.


**Card of the Day - jeudi 26 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tundra)#### Tundra

 Alpha rare. Shortly after *Legends* brought Mana Drain and Moat, control decks based on blue and white were so popular in tournaments that Tundra was often the most difficult dual land for players to obtain. 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 25 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plateau)#### Plateau


 *Revised* rare. The only dual-land to receive new art for the Revised set, the change was a last minute switch because the original art had become unusable. This version is actually by Cornelius Brudi, despite the misattribution to Drew Tucker. 


**Card of the Day - mardi 24 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Volcanic%20Island)#### Volcanic Island


 *Beta* rare. When *Alpha* was released, Volcanic Island was inadvertently omitted from the set, leaving just nine of the possible ten color combinations actually represented in **Magic**’s first set.


**Card of the Day - lundi 23 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Savannah)#### Savannah


 *Alpha* rare. This was the first card played in the finals of Magic’s first World Championships. Eventual Champion Zak Dolan immediately used it to cast Ivory Tower against Bertrand Lestreé’s burn deck. 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 20 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=The%20Ultimate%20Nightmare%20of%20Wizards%20of%20the%20Coast%20Customer%20Service)#### The Ultimate Nightmare of Wizards of the Coast Customer Service


 *Unglued* uncommon. This is the longest card name in **Magic** ever printed. For now. 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 19 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Burning%20Cinder%20Fury%20of%20Crimson%20Chaos%20Fire)#### Burning Cinder Fury of Crimson Chaos Fire


 *Unglued* rare. Coming much earlier than the split cards of *Invasion* block, this was the first “sideways” **Magic** card to be printed. 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 18 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goblin%20Tutor)#### Goblin Tutor


 *Unglued* uncommon. At the time red was the only color without a tutor card like Enlightened Tutor or Demonic Tutor and this card was a reference to that situation. The first tournament-legal red "tutor" was Gamble from *Urza's Saga*. 


**Card of the Day - mardi 17 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=B.F.M.%20(left%20side))#### B.F.M. (left side)


 *Unglued* rare. The “left side” of B.F.M. is the first card since the Alpha edition Cyclopean Tomb to be printed without a casting cost. In B.F.M.’s case, the omission was intentional.


**Card of the Day - lundi 16 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ow)#### Ow


 *Unglued* rare.This card has the shortest card name in **Magic**. For now.   
  
  



**Card of the Day - vendredi 13 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Chalice%20of%20the%20Void)#### Chalice of the Void


 *Mirrodin* rare. Chalice of the Void is the only card inspired by a **Magic** Invitational submission that didn’t come from the champion. Gary Wise submitted the idea for this card at the 2001 **Magic**  Invitational. 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 12 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gorilla%20Shaman)#### Gorilla Shaman


 *Alliances* common. There are 18 Shamans in **Magic** so far, but this is the only one powerful enough to see Type 1 play. In fact, the “Mox Monkey” is one of the only creatures *period* to make it into Type 1 decks. 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 11 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Recall)#### Recall


 *Legends* rare. Formerly restricted in Type 1 and banned from Type 1.5, Recall is the only ![X Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/X_mana.gif)![X Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/X_mana.gif) spell to ever be banned or restricted. 


**Card of the Day - mardi 10 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Meteor%20Shower)#### Meteor Shower


 *Ice Age* common. Meteor Shower's wording was so confusing it was the #1 most called about card for Customer Service long after it was printed. 


**Card of the Day - lundi 9 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Part%20Water)#### Part Water


 *Legends* uncommon. This and Recall were the first cards printed with ![X Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/X_mana.gif)![X Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/X_mana.gif) in the casting cost. Part Water’s casting cost also illustrates just how expensive unblockability effects used to be. 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 6 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Marton%20Stromgald)#### Marton Stromgald


 *Ice Age* rare. *Ice Age* was the first set since *Legends* to have legendary creatures, and the first set ever to feature mono-colored legendary creatures. 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 5 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ray%20of%20Erasure)#### Ray of Erasure


 *Ice Age* common. *Ice Age* was the first set to feature “cantrips”, cards that offered a small effect but drew a card to replace themselves. 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 4 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vexing%20Arcanix)#### Vexing Arcanix


 *Ice Age* rare. For the *Ice Age* prerelease it was ruled that, for this event only, you could describe what the card did rather than name it, since this was the first time anyone had seen the set!


**Card of the Day - mardi 3 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Adarkar%20Wastes)#### Adarkar Wastes


 *Ice Age* rare. The popular cycle of five cards nicknamed “the painlands” appeared in every post-*Ice Age* core set until *Eighth Edition*.


**Card of the Day - lundi 2 août 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Stone%20Rain)#### Stone Rain

 Alpha common. Currently at 18 (and counting?), Stone Rain has appeared in more core sets and expansions than any other **Magic** card.
