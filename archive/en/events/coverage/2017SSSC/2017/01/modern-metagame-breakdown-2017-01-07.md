With three rounds of *Kaladesh* Draft completed, the 45 Super Sunday Series Championship competitors are headed into the second format of the day: Modern Constructed. Here is a look at that metagame for those Modern rounds.

While there were two clear decks that were the most played in Jund and Dredge, the field itself was diverse, and many Super Sunday Series Championship competitors chose to come into this event with their preferred deck of choice.


Jund—and Abzan, for the matter—had variations between the decks both in numbers of certain cards played, and even some light splashes in [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls). Dredge, while the card choices varied, was carrying out a similar, straight-forward game plan. Fill the graveyard using dredge creatures like [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll), then put creatures into play from the graveyard like [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) and [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam).


Next up on the list were Affinity and Bant Eldrazi, though for the latter, the Green-White Toolbox deck heavily dive into the Eldrazi deck's strategy, so you could consider their representation at 5 players for this event. Affinity did what it does best, which is dump a ton of cheap artifacts onto the battlefield, then win through the insane power of [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) or through sheer numbers. Eldrazi executes a beatdown plan as well, but instead uses powerful lands to ramp out massive Eldrazi rather than relying on cheap artifacts.


From there, [Kiln Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend) Aggro was the next popular. Based around getting a really big [Kiln Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend) of [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) followed up with [Temur Battle Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Battle+Rage), the deck played very similarly to [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Aggro in execution, but shaved the rapid life loss for blue-red spells. This deck was capable of some brutally fast wins.


Of course, while there were some clear favorites for a few players in this field, there were outmatched to the number of archetypes that had only one to two players representing. Modern presents a lot of very powerful options, and it gives players a variety of choices when approaching a tournament. It should make for an exciting four rounds here in Day 1!
