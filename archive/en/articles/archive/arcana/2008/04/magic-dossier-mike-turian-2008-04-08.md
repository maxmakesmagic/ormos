![Mike Turian](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1564_Turian.jpg)**Name:** Mike Turian 

**Job Title and Duties:** **Magic** R&D Developer 

**Age:** 28 

**Family:** I'm related to Nate Heiss. People mistake us for one another more often then you would think. 

**Education:** BA in Communications, University of Pittsburgh 2004

**Began working at Wizards:** I started as an intern right as we started work on *Ravnica* (September 2004). I was hired to a full time position in March of 2005. 

**Previous job:** I would hate to call playing on the Pro Tour a job but that is how I paid my way through college. 

**How you got your job here:** After I graduated from Pitt, I moved out to Seattle. I goofed around for three or four months. One day I went to lunch with Randy Buehler and he offered me the six-month intern position. After the internship ended, Randy offered me a developer position. 

**Responsibilities within the company:** I spend most of my time doing development work and play testing **Magic**. 

**Expansions of projects you've worked on:** I led the *Future Sight* and *Morningtide* development teams. I am currently leading the "Paper" development team. I have been on *Guildpact, Coldsnap, Planar Chaos, Lorwyn, Tenth Edition,* "Donut", and "Rock" teams. I have collated every Magic set since *Guildpact*. I have built a theme deck for every set since *Ravnica*. (My favorite is Slivers in *Time Spiral*.) I work with the Market Research department to gather feedback from Magic players. I work with Erik Lauer on MOL III, giving R&D feedback. I'll do occasional work on other Wizards of the Coast products, such as some design and play testing of the **Goblin Game** or play testing **Axis and Allies** and its expansions. 

**Magic playing accomplishments:** Participated in 32 Pro Tours, 5 World Championships, 6 National Championships, won Pro Tour New York 2000, won Grand Prix Montreal 2002, Top 8 Worlds Toronto 2001, Top 4 Pro Tour Boston 2003, Top 8 Pro Tour Amsterdam 2004, Top 4 Pro Tour San Diego 

**Favorite part of your job:** Watching sets that I have worked so hard on being released. 

**Least favorite part of your job:** Arguing. 

**Thing you've worked on that you're most proud of:** *Morningtide*. 

**Other games you currently enjoy playing:** I just went 4-0 in our in-house **Dreamblade** tournament! We play German board games every Tuesday evening. Currently we play Vegas Showdown, RA, Amun-Re, Saint Petersburg, Acquire and Settlers of Catan. For video games I love Warcraft 3(including a mod called Defense of the Ancients) and Starcraft.

**Favorite Magic card(s):**
[Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland). I have a 3-D [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) that was made for me. It is awesome! Second would be [Blazing Archon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Archon). It was the first **Magic** card I designed. The original artwork for it hangs above my computer at my house. I originally submitted [Blazing Archon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Archon) as an 8-mana creature but it was changed to 9-mana because of another card I submitted at the same time, [Grozoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grozoth)! [Grozoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grozoth) needed more cards to fetch so [Blazing Archon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Archon) went up to 9-mana.

**In your spare time:** I read magicthegathering.com, [starcitygames.com](http://www.starcitygames.com), [gleemax.com](http://www.gleemax.com), and other **Magic** related websites. I like watching reality shows like Survivor and dramas like Lost. I read a number of books. I'd recommend *Yes Man,* by Danny Wallace. Currently I am reading *The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid:* A Memoir by Bill Bryson. I play poker on occasion. I just got engaged so I've been planning the wedding with my fianc√©e.

**Something the readers don't know about you:** I fight hard for things that I feel will make Magic a better game. An example would be I argued hard to get the watermarks onto the *Ravnica* guild cards.
