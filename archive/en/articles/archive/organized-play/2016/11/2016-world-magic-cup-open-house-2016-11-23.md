In the 2016 World *Magic* Cup, three countries that had won the title in prior years featured players from those winning teams. Italy and France each featured one player from their respective winning teams, and Denmark featured two.


Brian David-Marshall and our camera team had the chance to visit with each of this year's representatives from Italy, France, and Denmark to talk to them about their *Magic* careers, their prospects as they approached this year's tournament, and learned a little more about each of those players in their lives outside of *Magic*. The 2016 World *Magic* Cup Open House gives you a window inside the teams, both in their preparation and their lives.


You can see each of the five Open House segments from last weekend's tournament below.
