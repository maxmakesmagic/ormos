Martin Zimmermann entered the fray with blue-black control, Jan Hammerich brought his mono-red aggro deck. These were the two most succesful archetypes of the tournament, and here they faced off.



### Game One



Zimmermann won the die-roll, but started with two mulligans before playing a tapped land. Hammerich had [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide). "Now it's only one mulligan," Zimmermann commented, as he revealed [Darkslick Shores](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Shores) on the top of his library.


He had [Inquisition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition) of [Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek), but didn't like what he saw in his opponent's hand: [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)[Furnace Scamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Scamp), [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Searing Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze) as well as two copies of [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage), one of which he took. Hammerich cast the other.


Zimmermann was looking for answers. Down came [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) and netted him an extra card. [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) attacked and Hammerich, stuck on two lands, summoned [Furnace Scamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Scamp) and [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer).


Zimmermann had [Black Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) to clear the board, but the clock of doom that is [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) was still ticking. Unfortunately for Hammerich, he only had two lands and watched helplessly as his Shrine was returned to his hand via [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). When he replayed it, it resolved uncontested, but now Zimmermann's deck was operating on full power. He cast [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) and, unbeknownst to his opponent, tutored up [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated). When Hammerich tapped low for [Ember Hauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Hauler), [Karn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn) exiled the Shrine.


A [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) followed, which Hammerich killed with [Searing Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze) and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). Its little Zombie buddies started the beatdown anyway. Zimmermann soon found another [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) and Hammerich didn't have enough burn.

Jan Hammerich didn't have a lot in his sideboard. He just switched two [Searing Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze)s for two copies of [Act of Aggression](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Aggression). Meanwhile, Martin Zimmermann did some more extensive sideboarding:


+ [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine)  



-3 [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum)  

-2 [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)  

-1 [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated)  

-1 [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge)  

-1 [Consume the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek)  

-1 [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx)  

-4 [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren)

### Game Two



This time, Hammerich went to five. Zimmermann, after one mulligan, kept: [Darkslick Shores](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Shores), [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Despise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Despise), [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), and [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze).


Hammerich had a [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), that attacked with bonus from [Teetering Peaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks), while Zimmermann despised a [Hero of Oxid Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Oxid+Ridge). Next turn, Zimmermann used [Disfigure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure) on the [Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer), but had still no second land. Hammerich had no play during his own turn, and didn't respond to Zimmermann's [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek). He revealed [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and Hero of Oxid Rage. A baffled Zimmermann: "Err, yes? Then I take [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)?" Hammerich chided himself for his misplay.


Zimmermann found lands, but Hammerich found [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage). For the rest of the game, he continued to draw spells, whereas, because of his earlier screw, Zimmermann's finishers came too late.

### Game Three



[Despise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Despise) revealed: [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer), [Furnace Scamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Scamp), [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Searing Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze), [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn), and [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer). Zimmermann thought long and hard and, in the end, chose [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer). Hammerich summoned [Furnace Scamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Scamp).


Zimmermann preordained. When Hammerich decided to not sacrifice his [Furnace Scamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Scamp), Zimmermann killed it at end of turn. Hammerich had another [Furnace Scamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Scamp), Zimmermann another [Disfigure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure).


[Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix), however, proved a more resilient threat. It attacked a couple of times, then was returned via [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). It came back, then was killed by [Black Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith). [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) regrew the Phoenix, but [Disfigure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure) killed it once again.


Zimmermann made a [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) that looked as if it might be fast enough to race the Phoenix. Zimmermann was at 10, Hammerich was at 18 from two fetchlands he had sacrificed earlier.


[Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) put Zimmermann at 7 and the Phoenix back in Hammerich's hand. The attack brought Hammerich to 5. [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) and his minions, together with [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit), took Hammerich to 5 as well. Hammerich had the [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to clinch the game.

### Game Four



Hammerich started with [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage), which met [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and another [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage), which resolved.


Zimmermann had [Black Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) for the [Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer) and a [Disfigure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure) for a newly-summoned [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide). Hammerich wasn't able to make any creature stick, but he did have [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) and was clearly planning on burning Zimmermann out, when he shot a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to the dome. Zimmermann on the other hand deployed [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan).


When [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) and team attacked for half of Hammerich's life total, Zimmermann himself was at 11, with [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) on eight counters. At end of turn, Hammerich cast [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt); Zimmermann stopped it per [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze). The crowd held their breath. With three lands on the battlefield, an untapped land plus any one-mana spell would win the game for Hammerich. He topdecked ... [Teetering Peaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks).

### Game Five



Again, [Teetering Peaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks) was responsible for less than optimal mana supply. Hammerich kept [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning), Hero of Oxid Rige, [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), two [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide)s, and [Teetering Peaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks) as the only land. Zimmermann agreed that it was the correct decision to keep this hand, but the resulting slow offense allowed Zimmermann to take full advantage of all his discard.


Soon, Hammerich was left with nothing but a lone [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) on the battlefield, along with three lands. He only had a [Hero of Oxid Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Oxid+Ridge) and an [Act of Aggression](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Aggression) in hand, when Zimmermann reached six mana. But the control player knew about the [Act of Aggression](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Aggression) and played [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) first, and only then continued with [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine). The fatties finished the game in short order.
