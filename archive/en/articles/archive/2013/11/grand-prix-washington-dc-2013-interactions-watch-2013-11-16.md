Grand Prix Washington D.C. 2013 - Interactions to Watch
=======================================================



 Posted in [ARTICLES](/en/articles)
 on November 16, 2013 









If you're new to the Legacy format, especially if you've started playing **Magic** in just the last few years, there are going to be some interactions that might get casually mentioned by commentators or in match coverage that could leave you scratching your head and calling up [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx). And some rules interactions for cards printed sometimes more than a decade apart can be confusing enough that even the Oracle text won't clean it up for you.


But that's why we're here. While we can't explain every single interaction to you, we can highlight some of the more common ones, talk about how they interact, and any rules quirks that might be involved.


### [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell)/Giant creature/Enters the battlefield effects


This might be the most common sight this weekend, if recent trends hold. [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) is a "balanced" card in that it lets both players put something into play. But because one player built their deck with it in mind, that usually a less than fair exchange. Dropping [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) into play isn't nearly as exciting as [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) crashing onto the battlefield.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=%7BShow+and+Tell%7D)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%7BShow+and+Tell%7D) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=%7B%3Ca+href%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fgatherer.wizards.com%2FPages%2FCard%2FDetails.aspx%3Fname%3DEmrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn%257D%22+class%3D%22autocard-link%22+data-image-url%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fgatherer.wizards.com%2FHandlers%2FImage.ashx%3Ftype%3Dcard%26amp%3Bname%3DEmrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn%257D%22%3EEmrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn%7D%3C%2Fa%3E)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%7B%3Ca+href%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fgatherer.wizards.com%2FPages%2FCard%2FDetails.aspx%3Fname%3DEmrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn%257D%22+class%3D%22autocard-link%22+data-image-url%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fgatherer.wizards.com%2FHandlers%2FImage.ashx%3Ftype%3Dcard%26amp%3Bname%3DEmrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn%257D%22%3EEmrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn%7D%3C%2Fa%3E)


First, the way [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) works is that both players select their card (by setting it aside or otherwise indicating which one they've selected) before they are revealed. This means both players have to make their decision without knowing what card their opponent is choosing.


Some players fight [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) with creatures that enter the battlefield with an effect, such as [Bone Shredder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Shredder) or [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake). In these cases, both cards are in play when the effect goes on the stack, so the following interaction can happen...


### [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn)/[Karakas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karakas)/[Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake)


If [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) puts [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) and a [Bone Shredder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Shredder) into play, the [Bone Shredder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Shredder) will kill the normally nigh-unkillable Emrakul. Why? Because Emrakul's protection only extends to spells. Once a creature is in play, it's now a permanent and no longer a spell, meaning it's free to use its effect to target the Eldrazi. Same goes for [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake).


[Karakas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karakas) works similarly. It's neither a spell nor does it have a color, so it is free to target Emrakul.


### [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance)/Sensei's Divining Top or [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)


This one is relatively simple compared to others on the list. Player A casts a spell. Player B has [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) and Sensei's Divining Top. When Player A casts his or her spell, Player B gets a triggered ability for [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance). In response, Player B can then use Sensei's Divining Top or [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) to rearrange the top of his or her library to get the right card in place, then let the trigger resolve and (likely) counter the spell. If the spell costs one mana, in a pinch, Top itself can be activated to go on top of the library.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=%7BCounterbalance%7D)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%7BCounterbalance%7D) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=%7BSensei%27s+Divining+Top%7D)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%7BSensei%27s+Divining+Top%7D)


Note that split second, particularly [Krosan Grip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Grip), freezes this line of play out. [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) still triggers, but Player B cannot activate Sensei's Divining Top. For this reason, it is sometimes advisable to keep a card that costs three on top of your library for just such an instance.


That trick doesn't even work against [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay), which says right on the card that it can't be countered. It doesn't matter what [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) reveals...it will resolve (same for [Loxodon Smiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter), [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), etc.).


### [Helm of Obedience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Obedience)/[Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace)


[Helm of Obedience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Obedience)'s purpose is to mill your opponent until you've milled X cards or a creature, and then you get that creature. Basically, it was meant to be [Control Magic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic) for a random library creature or a faster [Millstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millstone) against players with no creatures (a common strategy when Helm was originally printed). However, for Helm to stop milling, it requires a card actually go to the graveyard. [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace) (and [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void)) makes sure no card ever hits the graveyard, and thus Helm never stops milling. As a result, the entire deck is exiled and the milled player generally loses on their next draw step.


### Lion's Eye Diamond/[Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor)


Lion's Eye Diamond confuses a lot of new players. "Why would I want to discard my hand to get mana?" they often ask. "I can't even use the mana to cast my spells anymore!"


The trick with Lion's Eye Diamond is to either A) Play cards from your graveyard or want to discard (like [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge) does) or B) play it in response to a card that puts other cards in your hand.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=%7BLion%27s+Eye+Diamond%7D)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%7BLion%27s+Eye+Diamond%7D) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=%7BInfernal+Tutor%7D)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%7BInfernal+Tutor%7D)


[Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) is the poster child for B), as not only is it placing any card in your hand (say, a [Past in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames)?), but it actually wants your hand to be empty when doing so, making these two a lethal combination.


### [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire)/[Grove of the Burnwillows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows)


This one is pretty simple. [Grove of the Burnwillows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows) gives opponents life on demand and, as luck would have it, pays to return [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire). Managing the triggers against [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman), however, can be tricky. And when there are multiple Groves and multiple Deathrites (unlikely, since they die to [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire)), things can get complicated. Just know that Fire doesn't return until the trigger resolves and neither does [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) (or [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze)).


### [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe)/[Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy)


[Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) used to be a guessing game, but now Storm decks are packing these two cards to get a leg-up on decision making. "Blind" Therapies—casting [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) with no knowledge of their hand—have become less common since [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) was printed.


### [Shardless Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shardless+Agent)/[Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)


This works exactly like you'd like it to. Normally, [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) has to be suspended, but if you cascade into it, you can cast it normally. And since its nonexistent cost is read as "0" for the purposes of Cascade (and things like [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant)), it will always get cast if it's the first spell hit by [Shardless Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shardless+Agent).


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=%7BShardless+Agent%7D)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%7BShardless+Agent%7D) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=%7BAncestral+Vision%7D)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%7BAncestral+Vision%7D)


This is the same principle that lets Cascade spells cast [Living Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death) in Modern.


### [Glimpse of Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+of+Nature)/[Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid)/[Nettle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel)/[Birchlore Rangers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birchlore+Rangers)


The key card to this chain is [Nettle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel), which untaps with every Green spell cast. With Birchlore Ranger or [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid), you can tap [Nettle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel) and one or two more elves to make mana, letting you cast another Green creature and untap [Nettle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel). If you've already cast [Glimpse of Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+of+Nature), this lets you also draw a card, meaning every card usually nets you more cards and either more mana or breaking even on mana. The combo works best with multiple [Nettle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel)s.


### Painter's Servant/[Grindstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grindstone)


Similar in execution to [Helm of Obedience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Obedience)/[Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace), this combination mills out an entirely library when cast, with some complications.


The basis of the combo is that Painter's Servant makes all cards one color, even in the library, so [Grindstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grindstone)'s "do this again" clause is always met.


Where things get tricky is when a player has either [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) or an Eldrazi (or something like Gaea's[Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessing)) in the deck. Eldrazi have triggered abilities that won't go on the stack until [Grindstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grindstone) is done resolving (i.e., the deck is empty). The result will be that the entire deck will get reshuffled, undoing everything the [Grindstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grindstone) player did.


[Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus), however, has a replacement effect, meaning that it gets shuffled back in while [Grindstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grindstone) is doing its thing. [Barrin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrin)g anything else, this usually means one of two things. 1) If there's only one [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus), that card ends up as the last card left in the deck, and that card only 2) If there are multiple [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus), the game will end in a tie with an unresolvable loop, as [Grindstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grindstone) will continually hit two [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) that immediately are shuffled back in.


### Killing True-Name Nemesis


True-Name Nemesis isn't completely unkillable, though it's close. If it's the only creature on the board, [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) will force its controller to sacrifice it, since it doesn't target or deal damage to True-Name Nemesis. [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) also kills it, as would Celestial[Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flare) if it's the only attacking creature. New Commander addition Toxic[Deluge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deluge) will also do it, as would [Massacre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Massacre) or any other untargeted way of shrinking its power and toughness.


Remember, "DEBT" to remember what protection stops: Damage, Enchanted (or Equipped), Blocking, Targeting. Any other way of killing True-Name Nemesis is fare game.


### Humility/Creatures


I don't know. Ask a judge.
