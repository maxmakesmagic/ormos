The [two](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/your-next-apprentice-2002-08-27)-[article](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/higher-education-2002-09-03) series I wrote on teaching **Magic** to new players got quite a positive response. Among the feedback were many questions and comments about “veteran players” who had taken a vacation from the game and then returned months or years later. I'd like to tell you something about what I've heard in those comments, and then pass on some tips to those of you who bring members of “the grizzled set” into your own play groups.

### Why They Leave, Why They Return

Each person's reason for playing **Magic**, no longer playing **Magic**, or playing **Magic** again is specific to that individual. Nevertheless, there are trends. Somewhere, locked in a vault, Wizards staff no doubt has tons of polling and focus group data that tell them why every customer comes and goes. While I don't have access to such evidence, I still have hundreds of emails, conversations, and personal experiences over the years to rely on. The opinions are skewed toward casual players, of course, but that's the only pool I track, anyway. Here's what I've learned.

| Invasion*'s gold cards brought many players back into the fold.* |

For the past few years, the number of players who tell me they're leaving **Magic** for personal reasons (such as income, new family relationships, and so on) has *far* outweighed the number of those who tell me they're leaving because of the direction the game's going (for example, “they won't reprint card X”). In fact, I believe the people who complain about the game's direction are among the most solid customers Wizards has—because if they stop playing, they lose a central social focus. (There's a possible insult for some of you embedded deep in that statement; but if you can see it, I probably didn't mean you specifically, anyway.)

In any case, the people that leave the game are soundly outnumbered by new people coming in—and that's not just my email talking. Urza block saw the most visible community outrage at the game (and even though I was not nearly as established a writer in the community at that time, it was then that I received the most “I'm outta here” emails), while *Invasion* saw the largest influx of new and returning players. I can't even begin to count the number of emails I got that started with: “I left during the Urza block mess, but once my friends showed me *Invasion,* I had to come back!” or words to that effect.

This means that those players missed Masques block. Good for them.

Whatever their reasons or timing, returning players are an example of a very basic mathematic equation—the game did *not* fit into their priorities when they left, and it *did* fit into their priorities when they came back. Sounds simple, but it's important to understand when reintroducing these veterans to the game.

### If You Love It, Set It Free. If It Returns to You . . . Smash It

Over the past four or five years, the play group that tolerates my presence (this would be more accurate than saying “*my* playgroup”!) has brought in at least seven players who played the game but stopped and has joined forces from time to time with one or two other groups with such veterans. This is compared to a dozen or so members who were new to the game when we pulled them in. As a rule, the veterans have lasted longer—partly because they're older to begin with and our group is fairly mature, but partly because when you rejoin something, your eyes are more wide open. You know the time and money commitment that the game takes, and even though you had to ditch for a year or two, you're pretty sure you can handle it now.

That means at least three things to your group:



|  |
| --- |
| *Trade commons between generations to keep everyone happy.* |

**1) You have an excellent trader among you.** A veteran who knows how much the game costs thinks in thrifty ways. While he'll bust some money for the latest set, he'll also usually be more cautious spending his money, even if he has a higher income. He'll also have a deeper pool of older cards for which newer players can trade. This is an excellent environment to trade in—we've had guys in our group with twelve or more [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel)s or [Sengir Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire)s because they *used* to be uncommon. As long as everyone keeps a pricing guide handy while people get to know each other, the social bonds in your group will be cemented simply by finding good trades on a regular basis that everyone is happy with.

One good way to trade with a returning vet is to store up all of your extra commons (and uncommons, if you have any) from the past few sets and then exchange them for a box of old-school commons. Eye the trade broadly to make sure you're getting roughly the same number of cards, but don't nitpick—if the newer player is getting a bunch of [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s, [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares), and other out-of-print staples, quantity is not an issue. Another way to do this trade is to get a few old-school rares from the veteran in return—not more than two to three for a whole boxful, mind you, and more as a “thank you for getting me up to speed” than any representation of equal value. The exchange will depend a lot on the rare and the owner.

**2) This player is proud.** She probably used to win in her own time, and if she loses often as she enters your group, it's more a function of her being rusty and not knowing what the later mechanics do than any measure of talent. Bear in mind that some players may have left before the *Sixth Edition* rules changes, which did a lot of simplifying and introduced the stack. That'll take some getting used to, for them.

It's up to you if you want to humor continual war stories (“in my day, we didn't have foil cards . . . if we wanted the cards to shine, we hadda *spit* on 'em!”), but whatever you do, don't get superior. Veterans don't need your guff. What they *do* need is an example or two of the stack (if it's been that long) and an overview of the major themes of each block:

***Tempest* block *(Tempest, Stronghold, Exodus):*** Not too many veterans have been out this long, but if they have, shadow and buyback are the two mechanics you'll spend the most time on. They'll also probably be surprised at the number of creatures with comes-into-play abilities that have come out since the *Mirage* block.

**Urza block  *(Urza's Saga, Urza's Legacy, Urza's Destiny):***  Cycling is key—especially as it returned in *Onslaught!* Beyond that, showing them [Morphling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morphling) and [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) ought to get the point across. No, seriously, they may want to be made aware of “free” spells like [Rewind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rewind) that untap lands (as that leads to many infinite combos) and the [Lobotomy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lobotomy)-style cycle of cards like [Splinter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) (as that can affect decisions on holding or playing cards).

**Masques block *(Mercadian Masques, Nemesis, Prophecy):*** First, congratulate them on their timing. Second, point out the Rebel chain for historical purposes, and make them aware of the fading mechanic ([Blastoderm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blastoderm) is a good way to do this, especially if you combo it with [Stampeding Wildebeests](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Wildebeests) or [Fleetfoot Panther](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleetfoot+Panther)). They'll already know about alternative mana costs.

***Invasion* block *(Invasion, Planeshift, Apocalypse):*** I imagine that this is where most of your time will be spent. Kicker and gating are necessities. You should also show them a split card (and give 'em a few if you have extras . . . remember how cool these things were when you first saw them?) and make sure they're aware of the *Invasion* and *Apocalypse* dual lands. Not every veteran has forty old-school dual lands, and even if they do, they'll still appreciate how well this block's mana base supports their decks.

The “domain” mechanic is a bit more subtle—go ahead and surprise them with that one if you've still got a deck that uses [Draco](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco). (You can't tell them about *everything* in advance, can you?)

***Odyssey* block *(Odyssey, Torment, Judgment):*** Threshold, flashback, and madness. None of these are rocket science, though madness may take a couple of go-rounds. The important thing from their perspective is that [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) is still good.

***Onslaught:*** You guys can learn this one together I suppose. But in case this article gets read in an archive, I suggest teaching them morph and then letting them see and enjoy all the different “tribal” cards out there (those tend to explain themselves). Players already familiar with cycling from Urza block will probably like seeing it here. Also, show them [Contested Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+Cliffs), and then ask them if they have any Arenas to trade!

Beyond the mechanics of the game, there's a certain cultural adjustment that may also take place . . . here's another tip about veterans:

**3) Old-school players used to play a certain way, in another group and time.** The old-school player will inevitably make comparisons (and if they have any tact they will do so silently or in the spirit of humor if they must speak) between the group they used to play with and this new one. They'll also make comparisons about play styles, rules interpretation, who has to get the next soda, and all that noise. It's not my place to suggest who acclimates to whom—I just want you all to be aware of the transition, even if it happens neatly and quietly. A good rule of thumb is to let the host decide the negotiable rules for that evening when there's a conflict (for example, do dying player's spells and creature abilities stay on the stack?), and for *everyone* to be open to trying new things.

One way of finding common ground with a veteran who's new to your group is to try a format that *no one* has ever tried before. This column has touched on some in the past, including tribes and various team formats. I'll visit more in the future, but you don't have to wait—have you ever played 2 x 2 Booster Draft? (That's two or more two-player teams drafting whatever packs you like, then playing individual matches. Really slick for nights when you have only four players. Lay out all the rares at the end of the night. The best team record either wins all the rares or gets first two picks of the lot.) Have you ever tried one of the sanctioned Limited formats like Sealed Deck? Have you ever tried attack-to-the-left? What about restricting decks one night to a particular color, and/or creature type, and/or letter of the alphabet, and/or block? (Make sure to choose a block that everyone has in their collections!) Be creative, and make sure all players are forced to leave their comfort zones. Discovering new formats together will make the veteran feel more welcome since everyone's feeling their way around and will refresh the play group's attitude. In fact, you should be switching up formats regularly even if you *don't* have a returning veteran!

### Old Dogs, New Tricks?

It's worth paying attention to the different *types* of decks returning players are likely to play. If they're good enough, and/or you're new enough, you are about to lose in ways you probably never thought you would. Why, I've known about poison counters almost since I started this game years ago—but I never actually lost to such a deck until a couple of weeks ago, when our latest group member came back from a two-year retirement to remind me that [Marsh Viper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Viper) and [Sabertooth Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sabertooth+Cobra) aren't quite as bad as I thought when they're played with [Hermetic Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermetic+Study) and [Seeker of Skybreak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+Skybreak).

I can also recall my first experience with a veteran about four years ago when our play group had exactly two people in it. We hooked up with a college buddy who knew the game all right, and of course he had a friend (isn't there always a “he had a friend” clause that leads up to an ass-whupping?) who had played the game back when Richard Garfield was still in diapers. We were just psyched that our group had doubled in size, so we didn't even think about what this would mean for our win-loss record.

| *There have been recent cards to augment most old strategies.* |

I had no idea what milling was back then, so the [Grindstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grindstone) looked silly at first—and I had never heard of, much less seen, a [Maze of Ith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze+of+Ith). Naturally, after a few head-spinning games, I caught on to both strategies just fine. A veteran with a milling deck that gets wind of recent additions like [Ambassador Laquatus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambassador+Laquatus), [Worry Beads](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worry+Beads), and [Book Burning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Book+Burning) is going to have to set aside a special play zone for his drool.

Now, you may already know about milling or poison counters. And a more sophisticated **Magic** Internet community has made novices more generally prepared than I was back then. But don't be surprised if you get taught an old-school lesson that I can't predict for you. Veterans are not back in the game to fawn over your cool, new foils and trade for them—they are back to relive the days when they kicked everyone else's asses. The fact that they may be doing it with shinier cards is, to say the least, incidental.

I'll hit up this topic again in a few weeks if readers have more to say about it. If there are any returning veterans with fun experiences to share or meaningful lessons learned, I'd love to hear you. And welcome back!
