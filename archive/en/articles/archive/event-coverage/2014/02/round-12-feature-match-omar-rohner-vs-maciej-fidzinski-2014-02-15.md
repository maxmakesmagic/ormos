Omar Rohner is a 30-year old Spanish poker player, residing on Malta. He might not be known to the general public, but eternal experts know his name from the top of several Bazaar of 
Moxen events. Both players entered the round with 10-1 records, meaning a win this round would put them in excellent shape for making the top 8.


Omar Rohner was running Merfolks, a deck on steroids since the printing of [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis). Maciej Fidzinski was playing RUG Delver, with main 
deck [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), which could be crucial against the Merfolk army. Even though there was a lot at stake, the atmosphere was friendly, and players even 
allowed a few takebacks, which you don't often see at this level of competition.

*Omar Rohner vs. Maciej Fidzinski*

The matchup usually plays out in a race situation, where the key for the [Delver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver) deck is to get ahead before the merfolk lords grant islandwalk and make 
each other gigantic. Cards like [Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer) and[Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) would be key, where Rohner would be hoping to get an early Æther 
Vial to be able to swarm his opponent with Merfolks.


The first game was all about [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis). Even though Fidzinski was first on the board with a [Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer) and a [Delver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver) Rohner 
was able to get one into play with Cavern of Souls making it uncounterable. A second [Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis) prompted a "Yeeeeeah, nice," from Fidzinski. Bearing witness of 
how vulnerable his deck was to the new merfolk.


A beta [Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis) powered up the pair, and the race was over in Rohner's favor.


"[True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) is pretty stupid sometimes," exclaimed Rohner after the game.


The second game, once again came down to Nemeses. With an opener of only reactive cards Fidzinski was able to deal with [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial)s on the first two turns, 
but once again a Cavern of Souls allowed [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) to resolve. This time on an empty board. "Boooring," Fidzinski exclaimed without irony.


He tried his best, by summoning [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) and a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), but wasn't pleased when the [Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis) went 
on the offense. "Not blocking, obviously," said the Polish player, having had just about enough of the card for the weekend.


When a [Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) showed up, cloning the [Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis), Fidzinski slumped even more in his chair. The race was once again over 
in the favor of two [Nemeses](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemeses).

"I don't enjoy playing against Merfolks, but it's always fun to play against Rohner. He's really on a level above everyone else, " Maciej Fidzinski summed up the match.


### Result: Omar Rohner wins 2-0
