It's Red Week, so let's take a look at that reddest of Mirrodin cultures, the Vulshok.

The Vulshok are a culture of passionate artificers and fierce warriors that share the Oxidda Mountains with the goblins. Their look, defined in part by concept artist Matthew Wilson, includes the metallic spike-growths in place of hair (see [Tears of Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tears+of+Rage)) and, of course, their spiky gauntlets (see [Feedback Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feedback+Bolt)).

In Matt Wilson's concept sketches, seen here to the right and below, the metallic gauntlets of the Vulshok start out "merely" as huge, heavy, iron, forearm- and fist-coverings. But when these mountain-dwellers enter a state of barbarian rage, the gauntlets glow with volcanic energy and they unfurl into deadly weapons.
