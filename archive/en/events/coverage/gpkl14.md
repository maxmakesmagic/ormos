Li's Stars Shine in Kuala Lumpur
================================

Grand Prix Kuala 2014
---------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpkl14/gpkl14_trophy.jpg)Fabien Li is your Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur champion! Taking a break from the UR archetype that served him well all weekend, Fabien battled through a top 8 swath of RB Minotaurs, WB mid-range and BG control piloting UW evasive tempo.


He was well served by the combination of [Wingsteed Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) and [Hopeful Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon), as well as a [Wavecrash Triton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wavecrash+Triton) that worked overtime to keep all his opponents' creatures tapped down. In a nail-biting finale, Fabien threated lethal three times off [Evangel of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evangel+of+Heliod) before finally taking the game, match and tournament with [Celestial Archon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Archon).


Rounding out the Top 8 were Park Jun Young, Ryan Young, Krissapas Kuptimitr, (23) Shouta Yasooka (on his 18th Grand Prix top 8), Jack Teo, Shamsul Bahrin Zainuddin and Mohd Khairul Anuar Abdul Aziz.


Congratulations to Fabien Li, Champion of Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur!
