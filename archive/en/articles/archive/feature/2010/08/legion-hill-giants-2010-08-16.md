Since the dawn of **Magic**, the term for a vanilla 3/3 that costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) has been "[Hill Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant)."

There have been numerous creatures at that power, toughness, and precise cost that also had abilities like [Lord of Shatterskull Pass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lord%2Bof%2BShatterskull%2BPass), [Ogre Gatecrasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ogre%2BGatecrasher), and, um, [Ancient Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ancient%2BKavu), but the noble tradition of the vanilla 3/3 has lived on. Behold!


### Hill Giant


Some would call [Hill Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant) the Trope Namer. It was in every core set other than *Sixth Edition*, ***Magic** 2010*, and ***Magic** 2011*.

### Tor Giant


*Ice Age* wanted its own spin on the [Hill Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant). If it had been "Snow-covered Hill Giant," maybe it would have made it in. But instead, [Tor Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tor+Giant) and his groovy mustache entered the scene.

### Ogre Warrior


While [Hill Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant) was in the original *Portal*, the other starter sets (*Portal Second Age, Starter 1999,* and *Portal 2000*) had their own version: a mean-looking ogre with a dangerous weapon.

### Barbarian Horde


Giants would have been out of flavor for the Chinese-inspired *Portal Three Kingdoms*, so the *3/3 du jour* was instead a bunch of barbarians.

### Wild Jhovall


For *Mercadian Masques*, the creative team dispensed with the bipedal concept altogether!



![Wild Jhovall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wild+Jhovall)

### Canyon Minotaur


After an initial appearance in *Conflux*, this mighty minotaur filled the original Giant's shoes for ***Magic** 2010* and ***Magic** 2011*.

### Lagac Lizard


That brings us up to this year, in which *Rise of the Eldrazi* introduced the latest member of the [Hill Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant) lineage.

### Bonus Section


Other colors also sometimes get [Hill Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant)s. Mixed in with the huge number of "[Hill Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant)s with abilities" (or sometimes [Scavenging Scarab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Scavenging%2BScarab)) are a few vanilla ones. Blue has [Giant Octopus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Octopus) (which is actually the smaller of **Magic**'s two non-Changeling, non-[Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) octopus creatures):

And white has two, one from *Portal Three Kingdoms* and one from *Portal Second Age*. Incidentally, check out the way [Trokin High Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trokin+High+Guard) is equipped. Who let a gun in here?
