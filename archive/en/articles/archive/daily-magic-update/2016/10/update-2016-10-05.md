The October 5, 2016 Update
==========================



 Posted in **Daily Magic Update**

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 5, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by Jonny Magic's semi-annual article writing, as he posted [a rare article today](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/storm-at-the-wmcq/) about an even more rare foray into non-Pro Tour tournament play.


Today's Must
============


1. [Top 5 *Kaladesh* Illustrations](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2016/10/top-5-kaladesh-illustrations/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Matt Jones

Short, simple, and to the point, this piece illustrates the five best pieces in *Kaladesh*, according to Jones. Well, really the top seven, as he includes two honorable mentions. But, clearly, if there are only two of them, they're ranked sixth and seventh, right?


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [A Pick Order List for *Kaladesh* Draft](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/a-pick-order-list-for-kaladesh-draft/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Karsten gets ahead of his normal cadence and releases his pick order for *Kaladesh* before the Pro Tour. I guess that means *Kaladesh* is solved. Everyone can go home now.


(But, seriously, this article is great for anyone who drafts the set. And you should draft *Kaladesh*. It's great.)


1. [NEW Red-White Vehicles Standard Deck Tech for *Magic: The Gathering*—*Kaladesh*!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZBND5XOe1U&feature=youtu.be&a) | The Mana Source | Wedge

The hottest deck in Standard right now is Red-White Vehicles (see the [Deck of the Day](#item10) below), and Wedge has a primer for the deck queued up and ready for your vrooming.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/XZBND5XOe1U>


1. [The 25 Best Decks in Modern: #25–14](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-25-best-decks-in-modern-25-14/) | ChannelFireball | Brian DeMars

This is really cool for anyone who likes Modern. Or semi-arbitrary rating scales. Here, DeMars ranks decks in four categories—whether they lose to themselves, how often they score free wins, their resilience to hate, and their flexibility—and then uses that to rank the decks he sees as the best 25 in Modern.


1. Commander Deck Tech Podcasts

Commander fan? Podcast fan? Rhetorical question fan? Well, then this entry is for you. I've got two entries in the podcasts about Commander decks series here, and they're both quite enjoyable.


* [Big Tokens Gruul](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/2016/10/05/e066-big-tokens-gruul-commanderin-mtg-podcast.html) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Nate Burgess, and Sean Whatson
* [Talrand, Sky Summoner Deck Tech](https://rocketjump.com/listen/talrand-sky-summoner-deck-tech-129) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

They both clock in at around an hour, so they're perfect if you have a terrible commute home today, or just need a palate cleanser after the US Vice Presidential debate last night.


1. [It's Smuggler's Copter's World, We Just Live in It](http://www.crcast.com/podcasts/constructed-resources-57-its-smugglers-copters-world-we-just-live-in-it/) | Constructed Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Eric Froehlich

Wait, two podcasts within seven days of each other? What's gotten into the guys at Constructed Resources? This type of productivity is unprecedented...


As I said yesterday, the [Smuggler's Copter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter) hype train has left the station, and pretty much everyone is aboard. Sutcliffe and Froehlich narrate the ride.


Top 25
======


1. No changes...yet

There were no pro-level events last weekend, which means no changes to the Top 25 once again—but hold on, because things are about to shift significantly as we head into two Grand Prix this weekend followed by a Pro Tour the next. Expect this list to look very different over the next two weeks.

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [We are all familiar with the way aether impacts our lives](http://wizardsmagic.tumblr.com/post/151297368696/we-are-all-familiar-with-the-way-aether-impacts)

For those not aware, the Consulate has been sending out messages through Tumblr, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KLDConsulate), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/KaladeshConsulate/?fref=ts) (as Consulates do in this modern age). This [#messagefromtheconsulate](http://wizardsmagic.tumblr.com/tagged/Messages-from-the-Consulate) just so happens to feature gorgeous artwork from Kevin Tong showing aether coursing through the city. It's quite lovely.

This sounds great. I'm especially looking forward to the part where Magic the Amateuring steals all of the submissions.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Red-White Vehicles](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=108107)

Here you have it, the most Kaladeshi *Kaladesh* deck that ever did *Kaladesh*—and it's currently the deck to beat.


It was piloted—that was on purpose—by Chris VanMeter to first place at the StarCityGames.com Open last weekend. Not counting lands, just twelve cards in the main deck weren't printed in *Kaladesh*, and the deck plays up Vehicles as much as is likely possible in Standard, thanks to both [Veteran Motorist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Motorist) and [Depala, Pilot Exemplar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Depala%2C+Pilot+Exemplar).


This is and will be the default aggressive strategy to start the season—so vroom vroom, mother truckers. Depala is coming for you.


And if you want to read about the deck from the winner's perspective, VanMeter [has an article up today](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33798_How-I-Conquered-Kaladesh.html) talking about the deck and his tournament win. Seth Manfield [talks about the deck in-depth in his article today](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13546&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=10-5-2016) as well.
