Each month, at [Friday Night **Magic**](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=events/magic/fnm), a different FOIL card will be given out. The cards feature the FNM logo in the text box and many have original flavor text and updated wordings.

It's a new month, so here's November's prize foil!
