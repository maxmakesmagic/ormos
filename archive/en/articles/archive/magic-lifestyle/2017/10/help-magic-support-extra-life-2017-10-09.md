Wizards of the Coast is again participating in Extra Life—and you can join us!


Extra Life is a charity event that benefits the [Children's Miracle Network](http://give.childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/). For the first time ever, Wizards of the Coast has created a "super team." This means you can get together with your friends or your local game store and create your own team to directly help us reach our goal of raising $150,000. If you're interested, go to [extralife.wizards.com](http://extralife.wizards.com/) and select "Create a Sub Team," then follow the steps to create your account.


The *Magic* team will be streaming for 24 hours on [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic) starting at 6 a.m. PT on Friday, October 13. Come watch us play *Ixalan*, *Iconic Masters*, D&D adventures set in the world of Ixalan, Commander, and much more!


All donations that come from this event will directly benefit the Seattle Children's Hospital. You can also check out the [*Magic* team page](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=34673) for more information on the events, who will be participating, and the prizes that you can win! Prizes? Yes! To help raise donations, we'll be giving away uncut premium foil sheets, San Diego Comic-Con exclusives, *Ixalan* booster boxes, deck boxes, and more! Oh, and this exclusive playmat:

You can also [visit our friends at MTGProshop](https://mtgproshop.com/) to purchase an exclusive Extra Life shirt, all proceeds from which go directly to Extra Life. The shirt is available in men's and women's styles.

The *Dungeons & Dragons* team will also host a [global livestream event](https://go.twitch.tv/dnd) for Extra Life on November 4.


We hope you'll check out this great event (and the D&D one as well!) and consider creating a team or donating to this fantastic cause.
