With Bob Maher up one format to none, the Magic Invitational Finals moved to *Mirrodin* Block Constructed. Both players were packing that pile of [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger)s, [Pulse of the Forge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Forge)s, and [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)s knows as Big Red. Maher's version splashed green for extra artifact removal, although I wonder how necessary that is. The deck was already good against affinity, and the changes make it worse in the mirror match according to the pundits. ### Game 1


If Maher was at a disadvantage before the match began, his triple mulligan in Game 1 didn't make things any better.


But Mattias was stuck at four lands for about eight turns holding double [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger), and had to discard over and over and over until he finally drew a [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum). Bob, meanwhile had draw no business, just mana, and had seven lands and three Talismans in play when Jens hit the table.


Bob detonated Jens, and Mattias played out a worthless [Damping Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damping+Matrix). Bob then dropped the hammer and [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)ed Mattias for 9 down to 7. Mattias responded by [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast)ing Bob with the Matrix down to 9.


Mattias then untapped and [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast)ed Bob again, this time with a [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel), then finished him off with [Pulse of the Forge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Forge).


No creature dealt any damage in that game--it was 33 points of burn.


Mattias 1 - Bob 0


### Game 2


Bob mulliganed once (that makes four for the match so far). His first land was [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel) but his second--[Great Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace)--was [Detonate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detonate)d. Mattias missed his own third land drop but had [Echoing Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Ruin) for Bob's second Furnace.


Mattias missed his third land drop again, but finally drew a Citadel a turn later, allowing him to [Molten Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain) Bob's [Tree of Tales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tree+of+Tales). A second [Molten Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain) a turn later took out Bob's [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), leaving him with a lonely Citadel and a hand of unplayable cards.


[Detonate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detonate) and [Molten Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain) #3 took out two more of Bob's lands, and Mattias killed him at his leisure with a [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) and an [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger)


Mattias 2 - Bob 0


Mattias takes format #2, making the Online Extended the deciding format for the Invitational.
