Players have only just begun to explore the world of *Shadows over Innistrad* Limited, but already some impressions had to be revised. We asked some of the pro players in attendance at Grand Prix Barcelona this weekend for cards which they initially underrated.

No. 8 Sam Black:** [Fevered Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fevered+Visions). I like it in aggressive decks and was impressed with how hard it is for opponents to stop taking damage from it.

Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* semifinalist Patrick Dickmann:** I definitely underrated [Morkrut Necropod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morkrut+Necropod). It's fine on its own already, but what really puts the card over the top are all the small synergies in this format, like tokens, delirium, creatures you can exile from the graveyard for value â€¦ [Silent Observer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Observer) is another card which has impressed me. Not much gets past this 1/5.

Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* quarterfinalist Pascal Maynard:** [Morkrut Necropod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morkrut+Necropod). I thought it would be a little bit clunky, but it's just the biggest creature in the format. It's a great finisher for black decks.

Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas:** [Sanitarium Skeleton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanitarium+Skeleton). It ends up that there are a lot of ways to get incidental value out of it. And the fail case of just blocking and getting it back is not that bad.

Two-time World Champion Shahar Shenhar:** [Tenacity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tenacity). The format goes to a lot of damage races, with lots of attacking and blocking. It's hard to block, and this is the perfect card for damage races.

Gold-level pro (missing four points to lock Platinum) Oliver Polak-Rottmann:** [Morkrut Necropod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morkrut+Necropod)! Thought it was so-so, but actually it's a great curve topper. Super solid six drop which may even get you to delirium.
