According to Lonely Planet, Ghent is Belgium’s best kept secret, and was one of the 10 to see locations for 2011. Besides that, Ghent is in pole position in the “Creative City Index”. Once medieval Europe’s second largest city, over the past century this unsung treasure of a town has developed a strong artistic bent, and is now one of the best places in Europe for culture. There are many fantastic museums and galleries, and more listed buildings than any other Belgian city. 


Ghent’s architecture is elegant and imposing, with the Graslei harbor, medieval cathedrals and the Gravensteen castle. The city centre of Ghent is the largest car-free area in Belgium. And when you soaked up enough architecture, there are many welcoming bars and cafes along the banks of the canal. 


During summer, Ghent hosts one of the biggest cultural festivities in Europe, the Ghent Festivities (Gentse Feesten). The city centre is one big festival with concerts and markets on every square, fireworks, artists, etc. It also covers the Gent Jazz Festival, World Youth Circus Festival, Polé Polé (world music), Ten Days Off (electronic dance music), and many more festivals. 


Grand Prix Ghent takes place during the last weekend of these festivities. This means a great experience, but also means you’ll have to book your hotel as fast as you can! 



*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#2012).*

* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
