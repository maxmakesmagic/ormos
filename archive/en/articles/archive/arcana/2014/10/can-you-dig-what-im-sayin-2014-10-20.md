 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 






Welcome to Things Are Not As They Seem Week here at DailyMTG. Today, let's combine the week's theme with a *Khans of Tarkir* card that is popular not only in [Standard](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/td/digging-through-jeskai), but also in [Vintage](http://vintagesuperleague.com/).


Enough preamble. Let's set the stage with the actual card:

That looks pretty cool, right? Sultai noblewoman delving into the Æther to do some divination magic? In fact, because this is an Arcana, let's have a bigger look at that art piece:

[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) | Art by [Ryan Yee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Ryan%20Yee%22%5D)


Yeah, that's really cool, but...things are not as they seem! Let's zoom in on the bowl she's divining in:

What the...? Is that an *eye*?


Nope!


It's *two* eyes. Check out the art description:


Clan: Sultai  

Color: Blue spell  

Location: Any Sultai location, such as a gloomy temple interior  

Action: This spell allows a Sultai mage to look into a pool of water and see the past—and perhaps the future. Show a Sultai noblewoman peering down into a bowl of glowing blue-tinted water. As we look over her shoulder, we can see that the bowl is actually a zombie's head with the top sawed off. We see just a hint of a UB dragon's silhouette emerging from a storm in the surface of the water.  

Focus: The Sultai mage, and the bowl of glowing water  

Mood: Fascinated. She knows knowledge is power, and this is the ultimate form of knowledge.


Artist Ryan Yee played around with the composition a little bit, as can be seen in the sketches for the art. Would you like to see those as well?


Of course you would!
