When “the past returns,” it isn’t always for a Core Set or for past-matters sets like *Time Spiral*. Reprinted cards may appear to repeat similar themes, but in fact they often serve as a way to highlight how **Magic** themes *change* over time. 

[Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter), for example, was a rather clunky utility spell in *Ice Age* or *Tempest*. But in the environment of *Mirrodin*, it was a brutal, all-purpose dream-crusher. In contrast, [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) was very powerful creature kill *except* on that artifact-heavy plane. Those strategic reprints served to highlight the shift in importance of artifacts.

Consider [Dark Heart of the Wood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Heart+of+the+Wood) or [Savage Twister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Twister) in *Ravnica* Block—powerful gold spells of old brought to a new multicolored home. [Elves of Deep Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elves+of+Deep+Shadow) (welcome to the Golgari!) and [Goblin Spelunkers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Spelunkers) (now with Sacred Foundry-walk!) also gain new talents in *Ravnica*, showing off the new value of their color-specific focus.

Cards like [Lay Waste](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lay+Waste), [Disciple of Grace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Grace), and [Swat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat) rode the “cycling renaissance” from *Urza’s Saga* to *Onslaught*, and [Frozen Solid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frozen+Solid) boarded a rather drafty flavor train from its origins in *Scourge* to the icy wastes of *Coldsnap*.

Back in *Odyssey*, the “gravedigger cycle” of [Scrivener](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrivener), [Archivist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archivist) and [Cartographer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartographer) joined the newly-minted [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) to highlight the graveyard-matters theme of that block. Reprints like [Patchwork Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patchwork+Gnomes) and cheap cantrips like [Guided Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guided+Strike) also drove home that graveyard theme. It’s all a matter of context.

So the next time you see a reprinted card, think about the context of the set it’s in; it may be an old card, but it’s sure to have new significance.
