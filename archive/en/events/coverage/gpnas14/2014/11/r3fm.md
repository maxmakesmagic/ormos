**Davoudi/Nelson/Merriam vs. Wescoe/Hayne/Skarren**


Both these teams came into the third round 2-0. This was common at most events for these seasoned players, as most of them would usually have byes. But with team events like this one, there are no byes. So every win is a hard-fought win.


In the middle seat on one side was Grand Prix Salt Lake City winner Brandon Nelson, flanked by Mani Davoudi and Ross Merriam. No. 17 Alex Hayne was in the middle seat on the other side, surrounded by his teammates Craig Wescoe and Frank Skarren.



**Mani Davoudi vs. Craig Wescoe**



Things didn't start well for Mani Davoudi in the first game. He had to mulligan to five on the play. His blue-green deck fought valiantly against Pro Tour winner Craig Wescoe and his Mardu hate brigade, but there was little to be done to recover.



 Wescoe went [Ruthless Ripper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruthless+Ripper) into [Mardu Skullhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Skullhunter) (netting an [Incremental Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incremental+Growth)), and kept the beats coming. Davoudi's hand looked good enough, with multiple [Crippling Chill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Chill)s, but for that plan to work out you need creatures to stick around. Wescoe had just the right mix to get game one finished early.




 In the second game, Davoudi was much better at getting his defense grid online. He had an Archers' [Parapet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parapet), Tuskgard Captain, and [Longshot Squad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longshot+Squad). But now his mana was tight.
