Hélène Bergeot started her career with Wizards of the Coast in France in December, 1995; afterwards, she spent a few years in the European headquarters based in Belgium and eventually relocated to the Renton office. She is currently the director of organized play and trade marketing. 






I want to talk about the two lawsuits recently filed in California that claim being a *Magic* judge makes someone an employee of Wizards. You can read our press release [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/wizards-responds-lawsuits-2016-04-20).


First off, these lawsuits are without merit. To reiterate what was said in the press release, with the exception of the Pro Tour, the World *Magic* Cup, and the *Magic* World Championship, *Magic* events are run by tournament organizers and local game stores who directly engage judges. But these lawsuits claim that Wizards runs *all* events and that the people judging those events are Wizards employees. We all know this isn't how things work.


Second, this changes nothing with regard to our support of the *Magic* community and organized play. We will continue to be focused on our mission to bring people together through their shared love of *Magic*.


Finally, because this is a legal issue we won't be able to share everything as we go along, but we will keep you as updated as we can.


I believe that the *Magic* community is the greatest gaming community in the world. It is made up of fans who genuinely love the game and who support the community in a variety of ways. Many participate in the community by becoming judges; it is these committed members of the community who are so often leaders with respect to sportsmanship and who are shining examples of what *Magic* and the broader gaming community can be.


From my work at Wizards, I've come to know many of the judges. They're teachers, engineers, parents, salespeople by trade. But all are gamers by passion. They come from all over the world, and their love and enthusiasm for *Magic* and for the community is evident just by speaking to them. They're some of the best people I know. I speak for everyone at Wizards when I say we appreciate all of the ways that they contribute to the *Magic* community and make it a better place.


Thank you and happy gaming.
