"I heard your deck's pretty good," I said to No. 15 Jacob Wilson.


"Well, I passed an on-color Soul," he replied.



 In case you missed the Vancouver resident on the stream dismantling his opponent, he did it with incredible flair. Why on earth would a seasoned veteran tap his Krenko's Enforcer to convoke out a Crowd's Favor targeting the now-tapped enforcer during the fourth turn's main phase? To use [Generator Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Generator+Servant) to cast two [Illusory Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusory+Angel)s, of course!




 The 4/4 flying angel for three mana is undoubtedly powerful, but the restriction can be difficult to manage if you don't build around it. Well Jacob did. As well he should haveâ€”he has three copiesof the blue flyer. To help facilitate timely casting, Wilson has seven one-drops. This includes three Crowd's Favor (he drafted four, but chose three as the right number), which allows him to cast [Illusory Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusory+Angel) turn three.
