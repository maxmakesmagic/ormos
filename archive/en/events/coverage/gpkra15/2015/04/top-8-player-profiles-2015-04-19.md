**Age:** 26


**Occupation:** Pi underwriter


**Hometown:** Warsaw, Poland



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


None.



**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**


Jeskai Tokens. The metagame has lots of Blue/Black/x Control, red-green midrange decks, and Red Aggro. I did not like any of these decks.

There are too many thoughts in my head right now to answer this question.

### Samuel Pardee

**Age:** 25


**Occupation:** Magic player


**Hometown:** Berkeley, California



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Grand Prix Portland winner, two other Grand Prix finals.



**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**


Wescoe Bant. It seemed fun and was supposed to be good against Esper (went 4-1 against it overall).



**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Three [Encase in Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Encase+in+Ice) was too many and I think you want the fourth [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke).



**What is the most important card in your deck?**


[Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector). It makes you draw more of your good cards in any given matchup.

### Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa

**Age:** 27


**Occupation:** Magic player


**Hometown:** Porto Alegre, Brazil



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Nine Pro Tour Top 8s, three-time national champion.



**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**


Esper Dragons. I think it's very good and I practiced a lot with it for the Pro Tour.



**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Right now I wouldn't make any changes.



**What is the most important card in your deck?**


[Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai). It turns on [Silumgar's Scorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Scorn) and lets you take a proactive approach, which is something the blue-black decks struggle to do.

Esper Dragons. It beats everything according to Guillaume Matignon.

Maybe play some more anti-mirror cards main deck. I like all the other matchups.



**What is the most important card in your deck?**


[Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai). It kills people quickly.

**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Grenoble, France



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Played a couple of Pro Tours.



**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**


Blue/Black Control. I don't see any bad matchups. Maybe [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) decks and the mirror are a little tricky.



**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


No changes for now. I really liked the decklist.

[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time).

Blue/Black Ojutai. I love control decks and Lippish Dynamite/Cologne Magic Titans told me to.



**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


None.



**What is the most important card in your deck?**


[Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) is the best card by far. [Foul-Tongue Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foul-Tongue+Invocation) is the second best, I think.
