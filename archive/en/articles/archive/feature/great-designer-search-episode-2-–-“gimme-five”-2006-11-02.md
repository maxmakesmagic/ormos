 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






Welcome to our second episode where we get to see our applicants tackle their first design challenge and get to see all the judges (save myself) review their work. I will give my two cents on each finalist's work at the beginning of next week's episode when I eliminate three of them. 

Before we get to today's challenge, I want to tell you about a few new resources to follow *The Great Designer Search*. For starters we now have a home page explaining what's going on and listing all the articles so far. ([Click here.](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/designersearch/home)) In addition, all fifteen applicants now have their own pages complete with all ten essay questions and their multiple choice test scores, complete with which questions they got wrong. You can get to those pages by clicking on any of the avatars at the top of the [Great Designer Search home page](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/designersearch/home). Feel free to check them out, there's a *lot* to read!

 One last note before we get going: starting next week we'll be running these articles on Fridays instead of Thursdays. There's so much work that goes into these that we all could use the extra day to get everything right, so remember to check back a day later starting next week. 

### Design Challenge #1 – “Gimme Five”

So what exactly were the finalists asked to do? Here's the letter I sent them:


> 
> Applicants,
> 
> 
> Welcome to the first Design Challenge – “Gimme Five”. This week we'll be exploring a design staple, the five-card cycle. Your assignment is to create three five-card cycles. Nice and simple. Okay, it's not quite that simple. For starters, I have a few rules for you about the cycles:
> 
> 
> 1. **Each of the cycles has to be designed for a different rarity (common, uncommon and rare).** Each cycle must meet the needs of its rarity. (I'll explain these below.)
> 2. **At least one of the cycles has to be a tight cycle. At least one has to be a loose cycle.** (I'll also define these terms below.)
> 3. **Each cycle has to be all the same card type.** No mixing and matching. Not even instants and sorceries.
> 4. **The card types for each cycle will be randomly assigned to you.** This is listed below. Note that every player gets to make a cycle of creatures and enchantments. No one was given a cycle of lands.
> 5. **No effect may be repeated.** If, for example, you use a discard effect on a common black card, you may not use a discard effect on either the uncommon or rare black cards. You can't even use it on cards of another color. Each of the fifteen cards has to use a different type of effect.
> 6. **Each cycle must be accompanied by a paragraph of no more than fifty words explaining what you were up to.** This means you will be writing three paragraphs.
> 
> I will now define my terms. Here is what each rarity demands of its cycle:
> 
> 
> **Common**: First and foremost this cycle must be simple. This means that it doesn't require too much text and is easily graspable when you first see it. The cards must also be relevant for Limited without being too swingy.
> 
> 
> **Uncommon**: These cards can be slightly more complicated than the common cards, but still not that much more complex. The cards should be meaningful for limited. Unlike commons, it is fine if they are a little more on the swingy side. These cards should be desirable for budget players who treat them much as other players would treat rares.
> 
> 
> **Rare**: Rare cycles exist to sell sets. We don't waste five rare slots unless we feel it's worth it. This means that the rare cycle should be splashy and exciting. They are allowed to be irrelevant to Limited so it's okay if they're bombs.
> 
> 
> Here is what tight and loose means:
> 
> 
> **Tight Cycle**: For purposes of this test, a tight cycle is a cycle that matches in mana cost (with the exception of the swap of what colored mana is used) as well as at least one other quality of the card (activation cost, power/toughness, keyword, repeated template, etc.) Card type does not count as this second quality.
> 
> 
> **Loose Cycle**: For purposes of this test, a loose cycle is a cycle in which the mana costs are not the same between the cards (aka they do not all have the same mana cost minus the color switch) and match no more than one quality (see above). Once again, matching in card type does not count as a matching quality.
> 
> 
> Finally, here are your assignments. They were assigned at random:
> 
> 
> Conrad Corbett - **Common**: Instant **Uncommon**: Enchantment **Rare**: Creature  
>  Andrew Emmott - **Common**: Creature **Uncommon**: Enchantment **Rare**: Instant  
>  Mark Globus - **Common**: Sorcery **Uncommon**: Enchantment **Rare**: Creature  
>  Graeme Hopkins - **Common**: Creature **Uncommon**: Instant **Rare**: Enchantment  
>  Christopher Jablonski - **Common**: Creature **Uncommon**: Artifact **Rare**: Enchantment  
>  Alexis Janson - **Common**: Creature **Uncommon**: Enchantment **Rare**: Artifact  
>  Greg Krajenta - **Common**: Instant **Uncommon**: Creature **Rare**: Enchantment  
>  Chris Luhrs - **Common**: Enchantment **Uncommon**: Creature **Rare**: Artifact  
>  Kenneth Nagle - **Common**: Sorcery **Uncommon**: Creature **Rare**: Enchantment  
>  Andrew Probasco - **Common**: Enchantment **Uncommon**: Sorcery **Rare**: Creature  
>  Ryan Sutherland - **Common**: Enchantment **Uncommon**: Artifact **Rare**: Creature  
>  Scott Van Essen - **Common**: Enchantment **Uncommon**: Creature **Rare**: Instant  
>  Noah Weil - **Common**: Creature **Uncommon**: Enchantment **Rare**: Sorcery  
>  Aaron Weiner - **Common**: Creature **Uncommon**: Sorcery **Rare**: Enchantment  
>  Landon Winkler - **Common**: Enchantment **Uncommon**: Creature **Rare**: Sorcery
> 
> 
> Lastly, let me stress what we are looking for: (note that these qualities are not listed in any order of preference)
> 
> 
> * **Craftsmanship** – This is the ability to figure out how to execute and combine mechanics.
> * **Innovation / Originality** – This is the ability to reach into areas that have not been fully explored before. Do not submit cards that already exist in **Magic** unless you have a really good reason.
> * **Elegance / Aesthetics** – This is the ability to find ways to make the mechanics as simple, direct and easy to grasp as possible.
> * **Presentation** – This is the ability to maximize how cards will be perceived by the players.
> * **Flavor** – This is the ability to add layers to the card through making the mechanics convey a whole larger than the parts.
> * **Synergy** – This is the ability to find ways to have the different parts of a card be relevant with one another. This also applies to finding ways to make cards work well together.
> * **Understanding of the Color Pie** – This is the ability to show that you understand where mechanics fall in the color pie. (Hint: Don't rely a lot on *Time Spiral*.)
> * **Understanding of Rarity** – This is the ability to make cards appropriate for each rarity.
> * **Understanding of Power Level** – While designers are not the ones responsible for setting power level, a certain amount of understanding is important to keep from wasting design time.
> * **Overall Design Quality** – This is the ability to take all the abilities listed above and find ways to work them together in the card designs.
> 
> In short, we are looking at everything that makes a design good. Please take all criticisms to heart as the judges are the people who are grading you. Technically, I am making the final decision but I very much listen to what Aaron, Devin and Gleemax (yes even Gleemax) have to say.

For this challenge, each designer had to create three cycles, one for each rarity. Let's see how they did. Each entry will be followed by comments by Aaron (in red), Devin (in blue) and Gleemax (in lovely plum). Remember that you won't see my comments until next week when I eliminate the first three candidates.

### CONRAD CORBETT


> 
> Canto of Setia (common)  
>  1W  
>  Instant  
>  Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to each creature you control this turn.  
>  Draw a card
> 
> 
> Canto of Seayor (common)  
>  1U  
>  Instant  
>  Look at the top three cards of your library, then put them back in any order.  
>  Draw a card.
> 
> 
> Canto of Cremlor (common)  
>  1B  
>  Instant  
>  Target land becomes a swamp until end of turn.  
>  Draw a card.
> 
> 
> Canto of Ryxar (common)  
>  1R  
>  Instant  
>  Creatures you control get +1/+0 until end of turn  
>  Draw a card.
> 
> 
> Canto of Llanwa (common)  
>  1G  
>  Instant  
>  Gain 1 life for each creature you control.  
>  Draw a card.
> 
> 
> 

I wanted to show that I could build worlds too. The commons are all designed to put tension between "burn early for card" and "cast late for effect". The black one is the exception; it wants swampwalk. It can be potent later (finisher), or early, locking out a splash color.


> 
> Hall of Hope (uncommon)x 2WW  
>  Enchantment  
>  As Hall of Hope comes into play, choose a color.  
>  Creatures you control gain protection from the chosen color.
> 
> 
> Library of Lore (uncommon)  
>  2UU  
>  Enchantment  
>  Remove 2 creature cards in your graveyard from the game: Return target instant from your graveyard to your hand.
> 
> 
> Chapel of Corruption (uncommon)  
>  2BB  
>  Enchantment  
>  1B, Sacrifice a creature: Return target creature from your graveyard to play. Play this ability only when you can play a sorcery.
> 
> 
> Parapet of Power (uncommon)  
>  4R  
>  Enchantment  
>  Whenever you play a creature spell, do 2 damage to target creature or player.
> 
> 
> Thicket of Thews (uncommon)  
>  2G  
>  Enchantment  
>  Whenever a creature comes into play under your control, you may put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.
> 
> 
> 

The gods gain their power from believers. The cards echo this. I tried to emphasize "White Protect, Blue Learn, Black Corrupt, Red Hurt, Green Cooperate" here, helping set the tone for the set. I also tried to make these solid budget cards, while still relevant in limited.


> 
> Setia, Defender of Hope (rare)  
>  9W  
>  Legendary Creature – Avatar Angel  
>  4/10  
>  If your life total is less than 10, Setia, Defender of Hope costs 1 less for each point below ten your life total is.

> 
> 
> Seayor, Lord of Lore (rare)  
>  6UU  
>  Legendary Creature – Avatar Wizard  
>  5/5  
>  Seayor, Lord of Learning costs 1 less for each card you have drawn this turn.

>  6/6  
>  Ryxar, Dragon of Power costs 1 less to play for each damage that has been dealt to an opponent this turn.

These are the gods of this world, around which all societies are built. I hate expensive creatures, so I made them as Timmy/Spike cards by making them cheaper in decks that support them. The gods answer the call of those who do their will. Correct costs depend on environment.

Aaron: Hrm. Conrad's commons don't feel like a cycle to me, they feel like “some cantrips.” Granted, I imagine we have or will cycle cantrips at common, but what is trying to show me here? Uncommon… “some enchantments.” No one I know would ever be able to identify them as a cycle. The rares were pretty cool, although not without problems. I wouldn't call out “affinity” on one of them unless you wanted to do it on them all, like “affinity for damage dealt to opponents.” It's probably better to leave the word affinity off of them all and just spell out the ability long. And if they all had identical mana costs, they'd hang together better.

Devin: Last week I praised Conrad's work, but in retrospect I made a mistake by doing so. Looking back on my words, I'm not sure I why I rated him so highly at the time, but I now feel that Decree of Proper Form and Neka's Portal from that submission are definite misses, while Channel Hate is clearly almost identical to Devour in Shadow, also making it a miss. Valley of Shiv is probably too powerful to do, and is only interesting because of its overpoweredness. Lands that produce two mana and cards that turn cards into mana are both things that have burned us many times before and we're much more careful about those things now. I still like Little Spider and Really Focus from that submission a lot, but the other 4 were misses for me, and I'm really not sure why I praised the submission so much. I looked back at my old comments on all the other applicants, and they still ring true to me. I stand by them.

On to this week. The common cycles are just cantrips. Magic already has cantrips. I see that he is trying to emphasize a tension between “burn this early” or “cast for effect and card later”, but tons of Magic cantrips (Bandage, etc.) do that already too. You have to design something new. Submitting a ‘cycle' of cantrips that don't have anything to do with each other except being cantrips is a definite miss for me. The uncommon enchantments also do not seem like a true cycle. They have nothing to do with each other at all. Also a miss. 

The rares are a loose cycle in that they all reduce their costs, but I feel like the individual cards have all been done before better. The whole cycle is very similar to the Prophecy Avatars, except that those are much cleaner. Setia is really similar to Avatar of Hope. Cremlor borrows from Avatar of Woe, while Ryxar is a clunkier Rorix or Akroma. I found them to be a miss. On the whole, I feel like this submission conveyed less of an understanding of what a Magic cycle is, tight or loose, than almost any of the other submissions. That is not good. Our standards go up every week as the bar gets higher. In earlier rounds, with hundreds of people left, I might have given this a 3, but at this week's standard, I have to give this one a 1 out of 10 this week.

Gleemax:

Common – Dream job on the line and the best you can do is a cycle of weak cantrips?   
 Uncommon – Which is a step up from uncommon where you didn't even bother making a cycle.  
 Rare – Leaving your best cycle of the bunch (and best is a relative term) a poor riff on affinity.  
 You might not need to keep next weekend clear.

### ANDREW EMMOTT

Wow, this was hard!


> 
> Tjilpari Scout (common)  
>  WW  
>  Creature - Cat Soldier Scout  
>  2/1  
>  Whenever Tjilpari Scout attacks, untap all attacking creatures.
> 
> 
> Kitefoot Scout (common)  
>  UU  
>  Creature - Human Wizard Scout  
>  2/1  
>  Whenever Kitefoot Scout attacks, all other attacking creatures gain flying until end of turn.
> 
> 
> Scandaltooth Scout (common)  
>  BB  
>  Creature - Rat Rogue Scout  
>  2/1  
>  Whenever Scandaltooth Scout attacks, target tapped creature gets +1/-1 until end of turn.
> 
> 
> Bloodrunner Scout (common)  
>  RR  
>  Creature - Orc Warrior Scout  
>  2/1  
>  Whenever Bloodrunner Scout attacks, creatures you control gain first strike until end of turn.
> 
> 
> Lurin's Scout (common)  
>  GG  
>  Creature - Dryad Shaman Scout  
>  2/1  
>  Whenever Lurin's Scout attacks, you may put a land card from your hand into play.
> 
> 
> 

I had several goals here:  
 1. Introduce the major races of the block.  
 2. Flavorfully explore the idea of scouting in each color.  
 3. Avoid redundant effects.  
 4. Encourage players to attack.  
 5. Ensure that each effect was worth risking your 1-toughness creature for, but wasn't overpowered in repetition.


> 
> Altjira's Oath (uncommon)  
>  1WW  
>  Enchantment

>  GG  
>  Enchantment

> 
> 
> 

Again, my goals:  
 1. Enable multi-color play without forcing combinations, (Can be nice in limited).  
 2. Again, use the cycle to unify block flavors.  
 3. Again, Avoid redundant effects.  
 4. Again, encourage players to play and move forward.  
 5. Discourage simple splashes with double colored mana.

I felt getting Instant at Rare was a difficult assignment. I wanted to make a cycle whose pieces could combine with each other, and I wanted to explore the idea of cards having some function while they are still in your library. I would have rather done this with enchantments.

Aaron: Andrew's commons are okay, similar to Smogsteed Rider from Guildpact. I don't like having “CC” creatures at common in great number, as their power is difficult to realize in sealed and draft. But the cards work fine. The uncommon Oaths do a cool thing, enabling open-ended multicolored play, but the double-mana costs bug me here as well. But that's easy to fix. The Rift rares are far too parasitic for me to like them—they tell me exactly one kind of deck to build, and that deck doesn't seem all that fun. They sure wouldn't be a sales-driver. A passing grade overall for Andrew, although I'm generally surprised at how much trouble people are having with rares. I thought rares were the *easiest* things to make…

Devin: Last week I called Andrew's submission okay but not great. This week, I find this one improved to pretty decent, neither among the best nor worst. On the common cycle, I liked and admired the simplicity of the scouts. I liked the goals listed on the commons, especially encouraging players to attack. These scouts seemed flavorfully scouting to me too. This much CC in the casting cost at common is a mistake. On the whole, one of the best common cycles. The uncommon cycle was good too. I liked the open-endededness. CC “to discourage simple splashes” is a mistake here too – they already force you to multicolor – they shouldn't also break your back to build a manabase or cast your spells. That is not a good place to emphasize turbo-tension. It would also be better instead of saying “Whenever you play a non-white, non-artifact spell” to say “Whenever you play a blue,black,red, or green spell.” It's the same length, and it becomes a combo with multicolored cards instead of a nombo. Recall Quirion Dryad. The execution was also good on these individual cards.

The rares fell down a lot in quality from the other two cycles. Many applicants went to the area of RFG'ing a lot of cards from your library as a cost. Listen to me: Players hate self-milling, and they will hate this. As one of many examples, look how little Arc-Slogger is worth compared to how powerful he is. And I guarantee that the judges hate it too. Just stop submitting it - everyone. The execution on these rares was not awesome either. All in all, 2 good cycles with some minor flaws, and a bad cycle makes this pretty decent. A 6 out of 10 for me.

Gleemax:

Common – Solid design but painfully unoriginal.  
 Uncommon – Again solid design but still not very exciting.  
 Rare – Finally you get original and the design stops being solid.   
 If you last another week, try something crazy like putting the solid design work on the same cards that are innovative.

The revenge cycle is inherently tempo based and benefits from the fact that these are sorceries in that you have a turn to use the effect before it can be used by your opponent. Additionally, it introduces interesting sideboarding decisions. This cycle could easily expand into a larger mechanic.

What would it look like if Goblins overran a world? This flavorful cycle looks at how different groups would survive the onslaught, as well as uses the Legendary rule to give a feeling of these groups having been decimated, with only the strongest still alive.

The Changelings are a race of creatures that change emotions (or aspects) when defeated. This cycle suggests building larger decks since you always want to have another Changeling to search out, but you do not want them clogging up your hand.

Aaron: Mark's commons are based, alas, around a drawback. While reasonably interesting for Limited, I doubt anyone with access to any amount of cards would ever decide that revenge cards were right for their casual Constructed decks. Doable but not impressive. Mark's uncommon are, again, saddled with a drawback but at least the upside is something everyone would like. I don't think most players would ever choose The Last of the Elves over Elvish Champion for their decks, however, and I really don't like that the red one is different just to try to evoke something external. The rares at least are all upside, but the upside is parasitic. Why not let them search up any non-[color] creature? Open-endedness would benefit this cycle greatly. To me, Mark took a small step backwards this week.

Devin: Last week, I said “I liked Mark's submission pretty well overall, and there's a lot of creativity, but there were also a couple of holes.” This week, the submission was much worse. Argh, I hated the revenge cycle at common. Players won't like a mechanic that says my opponent gets to cast my own spells on me. It is not fun. Even worse, when the opponent doesn't have the right color, giving players G rampant growth and 1B discard 2 seems terrible. These badly designed. 

On the uncommons, this was a weird “cycle” in that the fifth one is different for flavor reasons. The flavor reasons would have to be compelling to make that make sense as a cycle, and this flavor was not compelling for me. Without the flavor justification, the drawbacks don't fly here, and I did not like this cycle. I also dislike mechanics (which have often been submitted in this search) that say “Don't play 4-ofs in your deck” like these enchantments do. Occasional Bazaar of Wonders are awesome one-ofs to do, but in general, players like playing 4-ofs! Don't tell them they shouldn't. 

The rare cycle mechanic does not work in Limited because they are all rare and you won't have two. In Constructed, even in a 2-color deck, the guys just never ever die if you have 8 of them in your deck. There's no way it's fun to have to kill 8 of these things in a row. He does get a point here for having “You may pay o1” to make it more interactive. 0-mana sac effects on powerful monsters is often a mistake. Kagemaro and Ghost Council play much better with a one mana activation cost than with none. With three missed cycles this week, this was a very weak submission. I have to give it a 1 out of 10.

Gleemax:  
 Common – You'll find most players like spells that are better for them than their opponent.  
 Uncommon – The fun of tribal without any of the fun of tribal.  
 Rare – Interesting concept, horrible execution.  
 Be glad this contest is graded based on the conglomerate work. If your fate rested on this week's challenge, I wouldn't like your chances.

I emulated built-in mini-auras by borrowing [Sensei Golden-Tail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei+Golden-Tail)'s "memory" counters. Making sure each effect had the possibility of being relevant on either your creatures or your opponent's added depth to their play options. This quality, plus the tight cycle, allowed me to explore each color's take on drawback-related abilities.

My take on "equipping" creatures with a spell. The effect meeting 3 criteria was critical; 1) simple and in-color yet interesting, 2) relevant as a post-combat effect, 3) not horribly abusive as a recurring effect once/turn. I love the flavor of "imbuing" creatures to make their touch have cool abilities.

As all colors have precedent for token-producing enchantments, I wanted to see how far a rare cycle could push the tokens produced. I tried to make each token "chase" enough on its own, yet tempting enough to warrant the risk and effort to go for multiples.

Aaron: I can't tell if Graeme's commons were supposed to grant their abilities to *all* creatures with charm counters, or if each was supposed to remember who it gave the ability to. I have a feeling it's the latter, which seems like a bad idea. [Sensei Golden-Tail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei+Golden-Tail) worked okay because he was one rare card, but a whole bunch of commons marking up stuff wouldn't be received well here. The flavor of his uncommon “imbue” cards was cool, combining haunt with traditional Auras. I like his rares—all upside—but I wonder how much simpler they could get and still be cool and have all the decisions remain. Two out of three cycles work for me.

Devin: Last week I said “A combination of innovative new areas, cool individual cards, and many cards that I could see actually putting into a set made this a winning submission for me.” Let's see how he did this week.

The Charm counter commons would play well in a computer game, but not in paper **Magic**. It's too confusing when I have Green and Red charm counter guy out, and my opponent has black charm counter guy out, and three other guys each have a penny on them, and none of the players can keep track of which guys have which stats and abilities. [Sensei Golden-Tail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei+Golden-Tail), who he says inspired these, could do this because it was a single rare. He was likely the only source of random pennies on the board. But doing 5 common creatures that do this is a big mistake.

The uncommon Imbue cycle is a pretty good idea for a keyword, but the execution has some notable flaws here. A lot of the point of cards that can be played in two ways is that sometimes you do one, and sometimes you do the other. The G and W and U ones would almost never be hardcast.

I liked the rare Eyes. They would be better if tightened in focus. There doesn't need to be a sacrifice option, and it draws focus from what the card is trying to do, so it should not be there. Since the counters take some work, once the sacrifice is gone you can take the mana cost off of the activation, in some cases compensating with a higher hard cost. With no activation cost, they are cleaner and read much better. Overall, I thought this was significantly worse than his good work last week. This week I give this a 4 out of 10. I'd love to see Graeme get back to his previous higher level of quality work.

Gleemax:  
 Common – Perhaps you missed last week's memo: worry about memory issues (especially at common).  
 Uncommon – Interesting concept, poor execution.   
 Rare – There's something interesting buried deep inside this cycle.  
 Stop burying your interesting ideas in cumbersome and needless complexity. And mind your memory issues!

This cycle of 2/2s represents the most basic execution of how each color reacts to a block mechanic. Players will hopefully read the cards and not think that becoming corrupted is much of a drawback. But, of course, that's how we get you. Mua ha ha.

I toyed with costs of 3 and 3 here, but ironically I think they're 'sexier' this way, as it makes the color costs that much more appealing. Maybe my instincts are wrong on that. Note how the abilities don't affect power and toughness directly, but the cards remain 'red-zone.'

This cycle, somewhat inspired by B.F.M. (right half), features extremely strong crazy abilities, but which don't automatically win you the game.

Here are some names that didn't make it to print: Half Truth; Half Dead; Half Breed; Half Moon; Half Pint; Half Hearted; Half Time; Half the Battle; Half Nelson. 

Aaron: Chris's “corrupt” mechanic explores some interesting space by limiting the number of times you can use a subset of cards based on some other factor, in this case the number of permanents you control. Pretty neat, although I question whether having random counters on all my lands every game I play is worth it, especially because most of these cards wouldn't feel overpowered were they not to have the corrupt restriction at all. His uncommons are a good use of color, and he's right that the cards feel better costing 4 instead of 3. I like the idea behind the rares, although I wouldn't make the “first half” of each card do absolutely nothing. Good ideas, less that ideal execution—sounds like someone we could work with.

Devin: Last week I wrote “I thought that Chris had very interesting ideas here, but that this submission was horribly hurt by needlessly excessive complication on over half the cards. Not among my favorites.” Let's see how he's done this time. The common corrupt cycle seems really complicated for common. Putting pennies on all my creatures? That don't affect the creatures themselves? And all my lands? That's a big bookkeeping cost that does not seem like it's paid off here by what the design contributes, which is resource management. Spike likes resource management, and this had some interesting resource management decisions, but there are much cleaner ways to give it to him. The mechanic also says “The fewer cards with this mechanic you put in your deck, the better.” I really hate that trait in a design. I really hope people stop submitting mechanics with that trait.

The uncommon cycle of equipments boil down to being able to pay a lower colored mana cost instead of a larger colorless mana cost. I feel like [Granite Shard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Shard) and [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) between them did this in a cleaner, more effective way. As for these individual cards, the blue has the problem where players don't know what happens when a hill giant equipped with this deals damage to a blocking grizzly bear. The answer may surprise you… These cards were not bad, but I feel like we've already printed a better version, and these did not offer enough new.

I really disliked the rares here. In Limited you almost certainly have just one, which means it's literally a blank that can't possibly ever do anything. Blanks in **Magic** are not fun! These are rare, so you probably won't have 4 to play in constructed either, which means there' a high chance this is a blank whenever you draw it. And the only thing worse than printing 1 blank in a set, is printing a cycle of 5 blanks. This is a bad design for a cycle. Overall, I was disappointed in this submission compared to last week, and I have to give it a 2 out of 10.

Gleemax:   
 Common – I'm not sure a mechanic that requires you to mark every permanent you have in play is a good idea. I do know common is a horrible place for it.  
 Uncommon – So-so execution with a mechanic that we've already done (in the artifact set no less).  
 Rare – Best of the bunch. Too bad you didn't follow through. (Hint: BFM was cool *because* it was two cards.)  
 You're being too clever for your own good. If you make it to next week, stop trying to impress the judges with your “out of the box” skills and start making good cards.

I wanted a mechanic that scaled in limited without being broken, or useless early. It feeds off an environment with tokens, flickering, and playable one drops. An alternate, "each other creature", could also be explored. Note that Locust Legionnaire becomes exponential in multiples and Apprentice Unsummoner is deceptively versatile.

Residue, unlike flashback, works on permanents and has separate effects- I kept uncommon effects tightly related for comprehension and simplicity. Restless Reminder differs, avoiding reanimation playable from the graveyard. Twisted Tenure purposely targets your creatures to keep it blue. I'm especially proud of Muzzled Memory's tweak on a staple ability.

Power bonuses were avoided to focus on mechanics. Sacrifice effects require equipping for flavor and balance. Bleeding due to block expectations (ex: [Sword of Fire and Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice)) could be "fixed" with colored equip costs if desired. I don't believe "loses all abilities" restricts future design any more than copy effects.

Aaron: Alexis's commons are fine—something we'd print that has good application in both Limited and casual Constructed. Her uncommons are pretty neat as well, turning the inherent disadvantage of creature Auras into a nice little benefit. As a rule, though, cards that make your opponent need to keep an eye on your graveyard make me nervous. They're kind of like on-board tricks that make you feel dumb when you forget about them, except they're not actually on-board. Granted, we do those kinds of effects anyway—like [Thrill of the Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrill+of+the+Hunt) and [Momentary Blink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink)—so I won't hold it against the designer, I'm just interjecting a bit of how I look at things as a developer. Her rares are a good way to use color on artifacts—by still giving functionality to decks not using that color—but they fail to “wow” me in the way I'd like rare cycles to do. All-in-all very solid.

Devin: Last week I wrote “Overall, a strong submission with good set-wide ideas.” This week, I was disappointed with the commons. They are Stormish, but they suffer some big problem over Storm. First, at 3 mana it's very hard to put a lot of creatures into play on the same turn as these. Sorcery storm also says this, but if you storm for 3 copies total, you've tripled the effect, making it really worth it to make the storm triple. On these, you'd only triple the CIP effect, which is not close to tripling the value of the card. If you put a 2/1 vigilance into play and gain 2 life, or put a 2/1 vigilance into play and gain 6 life, the latter case is worth nowhere near triple the first case. This is not a good cycle.

The Uncommon residue cycle is a very good idea executed very well. A nice twist on the “How do you make auras that aren't card disadvantage?” question. Good work. The rares were ok but not great. They sort of did the same thing as the uncommons, which hurt them. They all had their sac ability affect everything on the board except the green one randomly didn't. Cycles shouldn't have one card that works really differently from all the rest. Overall, I give this a 7 out of 10, which is very good in a weak week.

 Common – Wow, a common mechanic that actually might be printed at common.  
 Uncommon – The detail work is good even if the overall idea isn't too original  
 Rare – The idea has some merit but some of the individual cards are a bit blah.  
 Good attempt, but far from great. Push the envelope a little more.

The concept here is enchantments that have an effect while on the stack and are very powerful if you can respond to it with additional spells and abilities. The effect while in play should also be good enough to play even if you can't take advantage of the stack ability.

For my uncommon creatures I wanted something simple but with some depth, so I created a keyworded drawback that makes creatures very fragile and then used that to push the creatures' power and create tension in various ways.

For the common cycle I wanted something specifically for Limited and I felt combat tricks were a natural choice. I came up with evasion as a common effect all colors get, but simply granting evasion normally after blockers have been declared wouldn't work. So I made it work.

Aaron: I don't like many—if any—of Greg's cards. The rares all talk about the stack, even though Mark said time and again last week to stop talking about the stack (I don't mind it once in a while on rares, but they had better be worth it). They feel like they could be done in a very similar way with comes-into-play triggers that last for the rest of the turn. The uncommons all feature a keyword that no one would want to see on their creatures, and very little hint as to why they all have all this toughness they can't really use. But the ones that bugged me the most were the commons, which he claimed were “for Limited.” Check out the card [Infiltrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltrate) from *Nemesis* then look at Greg's cards. Maybe there's a reason why you'd want to make something unblockable after the fact as opposed to *just unblockable*, but that doesn't make them good, or even playable, in Limited.

Devin: Last week I said “A very solid array of cards that do some cool things and seem like they would play well. I marked almost all of them as good. A lack of new, innovative sparkle keeps this from being among the very best submissions, but this is solidly at the top of the second tier for me.” Disappointingly, this week's submission was much worse. The rare cycle forces players explicitly to use the stack, which all the judges said again and again last week should not be done. Many players don't know what the stack is, seriously, and we shouldn't force them to or tell them “This game isn't for you.” Everyone – please stop doing this! Doing things in response to a CCC card is really hard too. And build-around Johnny pieces should definitely not be CCC (e.g. RRR, BBB, GGG), because that makes it really hard to combo with anything. A big miss.

Uncommon featured “Ethereal (If damage is dealt to this creature, destroy it.)” **Magic** already has this mechanic: It's called “Having 1 Toughness.” 1GG Ethereal 5/5 plays almost exactly like 1GG 5/1. –X/-X effects are not enough to make this different. **Magic** players won't like a new keyword that is just a drawback and offers nothing new. A big miss.

On the commons, 5 different commons in a set that are all a variant of [Touch of Invisibility](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Touch+of+Invisibility) is something we would never do – they are all way too similar to do 5. They differ from [Touch of Invisibility](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Touch+of+Invisibility) by being hard to read and comprehend. A big miss. Three big misses means I have to give this a 1 out of 10.

Gleemax:  
 Common – You managed to find the overlap between confusing and unexciting.  
 Uncommon – Not worth a keyword, probably not worth a cycle, definitely not worth my time.  
 Rare – What part of “don't mention the stack” do you not understand?  
 One of the worst submissions this week.

Auras generally have to be very strong to get played because of potential card disadvantage. I tried to make more situational abilities see play by creating enchantments that could be good for you or bad for your opponent. The abilities are supposed to be two sides of the same coin.

These cards are a cycle of spirits that can infuse another creature with their essence, granting the infused creature their powers. I think there's design space for more than just a cycle of cards within "Inspire." The white muse mechanic acts like a super regenerate.

Affinity is a great mechanic that got a bad reputation because of its environment (i.e. artifact lands). I'm rehabilitating it. Most artifact cycles are about mana, so I wanted something different. My goal was artifacts that make you want to commit to one color with big rewards if you do.

Aaron: If you want to take something that can be done simply and do it in a more complicated way, you'd better have good reason. I can't tell if Chris's reasons are good or not. His commons are pretty neat, but could be worded more like existing templates (probably using “otherwise”)… but would they seem as cool then? And his uncommons feel like some kind of one-shot Licids, creatures that double as channeled-out Auras. The rares try to do too much, justifying their artifact-ness by potentially costing 0 under the right circumstances and doing two other things. I know we haven't done many cycles of rare artifacts, and maybe Chris's cards hint at why. Not a terrible submission, but not great.

Devin: Last week I said “Chris's cards are well thought-out and seemed like they would play well. His execution often had a few mistakes, and there were not enough interesting new concepts to bring this submission above being just decent.” The commons are a good idea, something that works one way on your guys and one way on the opponent's. [Phyrexian Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Boon) and [Clutch of Undeath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+Undeath) already did this, but we could do more. It should have said “If you control it, do this. Otherwise, do this.” Pretty good.

The uncommon Inspires are a good idea, but the execution was clunky. Is it really necessary to graft a “Sacrifice Muse of Sacrifice: Do something” ability onto another creature named [Grizzly Bears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears)? Do players think that works? Inspire is complex enough that the abilities should have been simpler. Pretty good idea though.

The rares were so crazy-color-oriented that it seemed like too much. I don't think they needed all 3 abilities. They were just ok. Overall, a 6 out of 10; good in a weak week.

Gleemax:  
 Common – Been there, done that.   
 Uncommon – Interesting idea, horrible execution.   
 Rare – If you trying to impress us, I'd try harder than this.  
 I sense deep down there's something there. Please try to show it to us before you're cut.

### KENNETH NAGLE

Web Challenge #1: Gimme Five

I was assigned these 3 cycles:

**Common**: Sorcery  
**Uncommon**: Creature  
**Rare**: Enchantment 

**Common Cycle - Sorcery  
 Dispersion**


> 
> Dispersive Silence (Common)  
>  W   
>  Sorcery  
>  Destroy target enchantment.  
>  Dispersion 4W (When you play this card, if you also paid the dispersion cost, target all enchantments.)
> 
> 
> Dispersive Mold (Common)  
>  G  
>  Sorcery  
>  Destroy target artifact.   
>  Dispersion 4G (When you play this card, if you also paid the dispersion cost, target all artifacts.) 
> 
> 
> Dispersive Blast (Common)  
>  R  
>  Sorcery  
>  Dispersive Blast deals 2 damage to target creature or player.   
>  Dispersion 4R (When you play this card, if you also paid the dispersion cost, target all creatures and players.) 
> 
> 
> Dispersive Path (Common)  
>  U  
>  Sorcery  
>  Target creature is unblockable this turn.   
>  Dispersion 5U (When you play this card, if you also paid the dispersion cost, target all creatures.)
> 
> 
> Dispersive Revival (Common)  
>  B  
>  Sorcery  
>  Return target creature card in your graveyard to your hand.  
>  Dispersion 6B (When you play this card, if you also paid the dispersion cost, target all creature cards in your graveyard.) 
> 
> 
> 

The Dispersion (alternatives - Radiate, Splay) mechanic allows single targeted spells to change from aimed missiles to cluster bombs. Since sorceries make poor combat tricks, I dispersed Limited staples. I went simple. Simpler. Then...simplest. The flashy fanciness is left for higher rarities ([Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth), [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon), and ... of course ... [Stone Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain)).

**Uncommon Cycle - Creature  
 Mana Invokers**


> 
> Lifebeam Invoker (Uncommon)  
>  2GG  
>  Creature - Insect Shade Shaman  
>  2/2  
>  1G: Regenerate Lifebeam Invoker.  
>  Whenever you add a {G} to your mana pool, Lifebeam Invoker gets +1/+1 until end of turn.
> 
> 
> Moonbeam Invoker (Uncommon)  
>  2UU  
>  Creature - Kor Wizard  
>  2/2  
>  2U: Moonbeam Invoker gains flying until end of turn.   
>  Whenever you add a {U} to your mana pool, target creature gets -1/-0 until end of turn. 
> 
> 
> Skullbeam Invoker (Uncommon)  
>  2BB  
>  Creature - Zombie Assassin  
>  3/2  
>  1B: Skullbeam Invoker gains fear until end of turn.  
>  Whenever you add a {B} to your mana pool, Skullbeam Invoker and target creature an opponent controls both get -1/-1 until end of turn. 
> 
> 
> Ragebeam Invoker (Uncommon)  
>  2RR  
>  Creature - Dwarf Shaman  
>  3/2  
>  3R: Ragebeam Invoker gains first strike until end of turn.  
>  Whenever you add a {R} to your mana pool, Ragebeam Invoker gets +1/+0 until end of turn. 
> 
> 
> Sunbeam Invoker (Uncommon)  
>  2WW  
>  Creature - Unicorn Cleric  
>  2/2  
>  W: Sunbeam Invoker gains vigilance until end of turn.   
>  Whenever you add a {W} to your mana pool, you may have a creature of your choice get +0/+1 until end of turn. 
> 
> 
> 

Mana Invokers give you combat tricks just for tapping your mana, complete with a manasink. I like the red one being prone to manaburn and the white one being immune to it. Sunbeam Invoker's untargetted templating allows good players to remember and bad players to forget IRL, which rewards skill. 

**Rare Cycle - Enchantment  
 Pacts**


> 
> Autumn-Tail's Pact (Rare)  
>  2WW  
>  Enchantment  
>  You can't play enchantment spells. Other enchantments you control are indestructible.
> 
> 
> Azusa's Pact (Rare)  
>  3GG  
>  Enchantment  
>  You can't play lands.  
>  Whenever you tap a land for mana, add one mana to your mana pool of any type that land produced. 
> 
> 
> Iizuka's Pact (Rare)  
>  2RRR  
>  Enchantment  
>  You can't play creature spells.  
>  Creatures you control have double strike.
> 
> 
> Arcanis's Pact (Rare)  
>  2U  
>  Enchantment  
>  You can't untap permanents.   
>  U: Draw a card. 
> 
> 
> Yawgmoth's Pact (Rare)  
>  BB  
>  Enchantment  
>  As Yawgmoth's Pact comes into play, empty your mana pool.  
>  You can't add mana to your mana pool.  
>  You may pay 1 life instead of paying {1}.  
>  You may sacrifice a Swamp instead of paying {B}. 
> 
> 
> 

The Pacts (risky "Hunted" cycle inspired) thematically conveys a story character that accepts a crippling deal for immediate power. Like the Hunted creatures, there's danger! The Donate problem is OBVIOUS – try retemplating the drawbacks to the clunkier "Azusa's Pact's \_owner\_ can't play lands." I hope Forsythe likes balancing potential brokeness. 

Aaron: Kenneth's cards are good enough to survive this round, in my opinion, but he'll need to step it up if he wants to win. His commons bury effects that aren't common in reminder text—innocuous-looking cards are actually [Tranquility](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tranquility) (ok, sometimes common), [Shatterstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatterstorm) (uncommon at best), [Falter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falter) (common), [Steam Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Blast) (uncommon), and some kind of one-sided [Empty the Catacombs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Catacombs) (rare). His uncommons are the highlight of the submission, triggering off of something we haven't really messed with before, which also happens to be something that players want to do during a game. My only complaint is that they're probably way too easy—the green one is a giant [Looming Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Shade) that regenerates as is gets bigger! Kenneth's rares made me feel sad, as most players won't want to make such a devil's deal. If you aren't willing to put a ton of effort into solving the cards, they seem to self-contradict, and are the kinds of cards the majority of our players would have little interest in using.

Devin: Last week: “Kenneth's had a couple of good hits that I enjoyed, and the whole thing did not have a lot of flaws. But it did not have a lot of awesomely inspiring newness either. He played it pretty safe, and a lot of the cards said to me "We really could make this card….But which players are looking for this or will be excited to get it?"” This week, the commons are a good idea, but some effects are not well chosen Common [Steam Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Blast), raise dead all are excessive. The uncommons were an ok idea, but I disliked putting mana sinks on the same card – it takes all the fun out of the mana sink combo. The untargeted template, which he calls out as a benefit, is a bad idea. **Magic** targets. I did not like the rares. Five huge drawbacks is too much. **Magic** players will hate “You can't play creatures.” for example. I give this one a 4 out of 10, losing a point for execution.

Gleemax:  
 Common – Good keyword, so-so execution.  
 Uncommon – Another interesting idea whose execution didn't live up.  
 Rare – Some good individual cards but would need a lot of creative support to feel like a cycle.   
 Your cards are not living up to your ideas which are quite good.

This cycle is intended to make Timmy happy, while providing interesting cards in the common slot for limited. One or two mana isn't useful after your sixth land, but at four or more the cards would be unplayable.

The search mechanic means different things for limited and contructed play, like a backwards ripple. While not gamebreaking in and of themselves, they colors more reach without bleeding, particularly the red and green cards.

Creatures that are much better in the first few turns lead to complex deckbuilding decisions. Seeing one early will generate lots of tempo, but drawing too many late will have you stall out. This cycle is supposed to be skill testing in that regard, providing exciting cards to experiment with.

Aaron: Andrew's commons encourage big, fat creatures, which is cool, but they could be more exciting. Perhaps they could be played for free and have flash if they target an expensive guy. Workable in any event. The “howling” uncommons are perfectly functional as well, and would probably be liked, but they don't “impress” me as far as contest entries go. Andrew's rare cycle seem pretty absurd, using power as the selling point more than interesting design. A 3/1 first striker for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)? Come on. I'm not thrilled with the batch as a whole.

Devin: Last week I though Andrew was pretty good, if not super inventive. This week I did not like his common cycle. They are very similar to the [Dragon Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Wings) cycle, but worse designs. If you really want to give your creature [Curiosity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curiosity), why do you need to have the creature appear with it, instead of just untapping the turn after you play the creature and playing it then? A miss. The uncommons are a fine idea, like howling wolf, but the B,R, and G effects are not well-chosen – with [Call of the Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd) already good, it would be really annoying to fight through 4 four-mana 3/3's in a row. The rares were not good. Letting your opponent turn off your cards is bad. 3 out of 10.

Gleemax:  
 Common – I like what you're trying to do but didn't like how you did it.  
 Uncommon – This idea would have seemed a whole lot cooler if **Magic** hadn't done it already.  
 Rare – These cards neither seem cool nor appear fun to play.  
 You'll probably make it for another week, but you need to notch your game up fast.

These auras fill different roles in limited in a new flavorful way. The green grants a huge bonus, black was meant as creature removal that will ping you each turn, etc. The Aura destruction effect was added to avoid confusion about a creature with a pair of these on them.

I'd probably recommend this cycle for a set with a mild token or tribal theme so that the costs could be easily reduced. I wanted each ability to be useful for a lot of mana in limited while playable in Constructed if the deck was tribal based.

Originally this was a cycle of split creature spells, but then I realized how much fun it would be to have the creatures have the abilities to switch over to their alter-egos and back. While they can still be played as just one half, this solution seemed more unqiue.

Aaron: Cool cards alert! Ryan impressed me with all three. He had good ideas that I'd actually want to play with, stuff that felt new and interesting, and just enough rough spots to keep development on our toes. The commons looked like fun cards (especially the [Afterlife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afterlife) variant cleverly disguised as [Plague Beetle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Beetle)), although those kinds of “overwriting” effects tend not to be common… and I'm not a fan of the hacky “destroy all other” clause. Just make them uncommon and make people learn the rules. The uncommons were very cool, using “affinity” in a fun way that guides you as you build your decks. The flip card cycle seemed really awesome, although it turns out that I'm only really a fan of the first card. It feels like he had a winning recipe and deviated from it, putting things like “: Sacrifice two Plains” when he probably should have stuck with “Whenever you play a white spell.” But the good idea is there!

Devin: Ryan had the best submission last week. He is very good again this week. Clearly the leader so far. The commons this week are a hit for me – the guy becomes usually better or usually worse, but occasionally you'll play it on the other guy. I don't think these are complicated. They would be better without the “destroy auras” clause – it is too much of a hack. The uncommons were a very good idea, though not enough of a payoff for having 3 soldiers, etc. in my mind. I mean [Glorious Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem) just always costs 3 to cast and affects everything and is always on. On the rares, we explored this kind of flip trigger in CHK and decided not to do it for a variety of reasons. This whole cycle is a pretty good idea but the best is the WB with the rest sort of along for the ride. 7 out of 10.

Gleemax:  
 Common – Not common, but very interesting.  
 Uncommon – A nice extension of where we've been.   
 Rare – Got a little too fancy for your own good. One neat rare does not a cycle make.  
 You're clearly one of the frontrunners for this internship.

Modeled on the seals from *Nemesis*, this cycle offers repeated small effects rather than one larger effect. Interestingly, cards in this design space trade surprise for the ability to affect the game without even being used. Also several act like auras without the associated card disadvantage.

The scout cycle is designed to promote attacking, but with some tension in keeping the scout alive. With the exception of the Vanguard Charger, each creature has an ability that makes it hard to kill in combat, except the Provoking Behemoth, which gets that benefit naturally from its primary ability.

Rather than tie together through a specific mechanic, the “Lucky” spells are tied together through the number seven. Each one aims to be a splashy game changing effect to get that rare cycle appeal.

Aaron: The common enchantment cycle is pretty neat, although I'd (a) try to get a mana on the activation so your opponent could breathe easier from time to time, and (b) figure out what to do with them when they're “empty” so that they don't sit around clogging up the board. His uncommons are take #2 on [Smogsteed Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smogsteed+Rider), a card that got no love during *Guildpact*. The tension of having them die during the attack doesn't resonate with most people. The “lucky seven” cycle is pretty cute, and may actually work, but, man, does the white one suck. Decent stuff, but middle-of-the-pack at best.

Devin: Last week there was too much complication from Scott and too many worse versions of things we'd already done. The commons are a very good idea, with a mediocre execution – too many are off in power level. The uncommons are an ok idea, but executed much worse than the other scouts submitted this weak. These feel less Scouty – 2 mana scouts feel much more like advance spies and look-aheads. And common is better for attack trigger cycles. The rares are too similar to existing cards, [Choice of Damnations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations), [Doomsday](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomsday), [One Dozen Eyes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+Dozen+Eyes). I'm worried about ongoing lack of innovation here. Overall 5 out of 10.

Gleemax:  
 Common – Been there, done that, but nice execution.  
 Uncommon – Yawn. Doesn't **Magic** already do this?  
 Rare – An inventive cycle connection but the cards don't live up.  
 There's something here but you're not designing on all cylinders yet.

### NOAH WEIL

The common "Release" cycle:

Release: "*Remove this creature from the game when you play its release cost. This ability may only be used when a creature is in the graveyard.*" 


> 
> Devotee of Djet (common)  
>  B  
>  Creature-Human Cleric  
>  1/1  
>  Release-B: Target creature gets -1/-1 until the end of turn. 
> 
> 
> Devotee of Ferron (common)  
>  R  
>  Creature-Human Shaman  
>  1/1  
>  Release-R: Target creature gains haste until the end of turn.
> 
> 
> Devotee of Tourm (common)  
>  G  
>  Creature-Elf Druid  
>  1/1  
>  Release-G: Add two mana of any one color to your mana pool. 
> 
> 
> Devotee of Mara'Bar (common)  
>  W  
>  Creature-Human Cleric  
>  1/1  
>  Release-W: Prevent the next two damage that would be dealt to target creature or player this turn.
> 
> 
> Devotee of Lazûl (common)  
>  U  
>  Creature- Vedalken Sage   
>  1/1  
>  Release-U: Tap target land, artifact, or creature.
> 
> 
> 

Release creates tension as opponents decide whether they'll avoid killing these creatures, or afford not to. This cycle is the smallest version; higher costs and rarities provide bigger effects. Release would go into a set with graveyard themes and/or discard costs ([Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)/[Medicine Bag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Medicine+Bag)). Could play alongside Pyre. 

The uncommon "Seal" cycle:


> 
> Shackled Ocelot (uncommon)  
>  W  
>  Enchantment  
>  Shackled Ocelot comes into play with two seal counters on it. Whenever an opponent plays a Black or Red spell, you may remove a seal counter from Shackled Ocelot.  
>  When there are no seal counters on Shackled Ocelot, it becomes a 2/1 Cat creature with "Protection from Black and Red".
> 
> 
> Petrified Viper (uncommon)  
>  G1  
>  Enchantment  
>  Petrified Viper comes into play with two seal counters on it. Whenever an opponent plays a Black or Blue spell, you may remove a seal counter from Petrified Viper.  
>  When there are no seal counters on Petrified Viper, it becomes a 3/3 Snake creature with "Islandwalk" and "Swampwalk".
> 
> 
> Accursed Crone (uncommon)  
>  BB1  
>  Enchantment  
>  Accursed Crone comes into play with two seal counters on it. Whenever an opponent plays a Green or White spell, you may remove a seal counter from Accursed Crone.  
>  When there are no seal counters on Accursed Crone, it becomes a 3/2 Witch creature with "Whenever a Green or White creature comes into play under an opponent's control, Accursed Crone deals one damage to that creature".
> 
> 
> Frozen Matriarch (uncommon)  
>  R3  
>  Enchantment  
>  Frozen Matriarch comes into play with two seal counters on it. Whenever an opponent plays a Blue or White spell, you may remove a seal counter from Frozen Matriarch.  
>  When there are no seal counters on Frozen Matriarch, it becomes a 4/3 Goblin creature with "Whenever an opponent plays a Blue or White spell, put a 1/1 Red Goblin token into play".
> 
> 
> Wyvern Remnant (uncommon)  
>  UU3  
>  Enchantment  
>  Wyvern Remnant comes into play with two seal counters on it. Whenever an opponent plays a Green or Red spell, you may remove a seal counter from Wyvern Remnant.  
>  When there are no seal counters on Wyvern Remnant, it becomes a 4/4 Drake creature with "Flying" and "All Green creatures and Red creatures opponents control get -1/-0".
> 
> 
> \*Aegis Xenophobe (uncommon)  
>  2  
>  Enchantment  
>  Aegis Xenophobe comes into play with two seal counters on it. Whenever an opponent plays a colored spell, you may remove a seal counter from Aegis Xenophobe.  
>  When there are no seal counters on Aegis Xenophobe, it becomes a 1/3 Construct artifact creature with "All colored spells cost 1 more to play".
> 
> 
> 

Color hosers have historically been absurd ([Perish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perish)) or laughable ([Starlight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starlight)). These block-neutral enchantments remain engaging as they transform into creatures with strong color-affecting abilities. Creature colors get combat abilities, while the rest get creatures that "feel" like enchantments. Plus a bonus card that's anti-every color, and the first colorless enchantment!

The rare "Pyre" cycle.

Pyre X: (*When you play a spell with Pyre X, you may remove any multiple of X cards from your graveyard from the game. For each instance of X you remove, reduce this card's casting cost by 1*) [In these cards' case, if you remove 18 cards from your graveyard as you play it, its casting cost is CCC]


> 
> Agony Strike (rare)  
>  6BBB  
>  Sorcery  
>  Pyre: 3  
>  Target player discards four cards. For each card discarded in this way, that player sacrifices a creature.
> 
> 
> Envy Swell (rare)  
>  6UUU  
>  Sorcery  
>  Pyre: 3  
>  If you control less enchantments than target opponent, you may gain control of an enchantment that player controls. Repeat this process for lands, artifacts, and creatures.
> 
> 
> Combustion Storm (rare)  
>  6RRR  
>  Sorcery  
>  Pyre: 3  
>  Combustion Storm deals X damage to target player and all creatures that player controls, where X is the number of Red instants and sorceries in your graveyard.
> 
> 
> Scion Sweep(rare)  
>  6GGG  
>  Sorcery  
>  Pyre: 3  
>  Any number of target players may search their library for X basic lands and put them into play tapped, where X is the number of lands that player controls.
> 
> 
> Seraphim Surge (rare)  
>  6WWW  
>  Sorcery  
>  Pyre: 3  
>  Put all creature cards with flying from all graveyards into play under your control.
> 
> 
> 

These splashy spells are the flagships for the Pyre mechanic. Pyre is strong, but gives developers a lot of control via Pyre costs and the generic mana in cc. Every player type gets a big spell here. Johnny (Red/White), Spike (Black/Blue), and Timmy loves Green's effect in solo, two-headed, or multiplayer.

Aaron: I like Noah's commons—simple, functional, and different. His uncommons buried my brain under tons and tons of text, and the result was the unimpressive, “I get a [River Bear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Bear) if my opponent lets me.” The rare “pyre” mechanic is neat—they get better as the game goes on normally, or you can build around trying to get them as cheap as possible as quickly as possible. I'm not a huge fan of the tension the white and red ones create, but that can be addressed easily enough. Decent stuff this time.

Devin: Last week solid but too safe, not exploratory enough. This week the commons are a good idea, executed well. Good job. The uncommons are not very good. Two counters is tons more text for very little play difference from the [Hidden Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Spider) etc. that we have already printed. Text vs. Payoff is a constant design struggle. The rare Pyre is a good idea with some interesting cards. Good job this week. 7 out of 10.

Gleemax:  
 Common – Solid design as usual, but still boring.  
 Uncommon – What I just said.   
 Rare – Finally, an actual interesting and innovative mechanic.  
 Whatever part of you that did your rare cycle, let it do next week's design.

These creatures have two parts: their [Gray Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Ogre) fleshly shell and their immortal essence. This is a tight cycle, repeating mana costs, power, toughness, and the “persistence” effect. 

Uncommon cycle:


> 
> Impale on the Peak (uncommon)  
>  1G  
>  Sorcery  
>  Search your library for a basic Mountain card and put it into play. If you do, destroy target creature with flying.  
>  Shuffle your library.
> 
> 
> Crash Summon (uncommon)  
>  3R  
>   
>  Sorcery Search your library for a Goblin card and put it into play.   
>  If you do, Crash Summon deals 3 damage to target creature or player and 3 damage to the Goblin.  
>  Shuffle your library.
> 
> 
> Craft From Flesh (uncommon)  
>  2B  
>  Sorcery  
>  Search your library for an artifact card with the same converted mana cost as target nonblack, nonartifact creature and put it into play. If you do, remove that creature from the game.  
>  Shuffle your library.
> 
> 
> Convert By Blessing (uncommon)  
>  3W  
>  Sorcery  
>  Search your library for an aura card and put it into play enchanting target creature you don't control. If you do, gain control of that creature at the beginning of your next upkeep.  
>  Shuffle your library.
> 
> 
> Inspire Imitation (uncommon)  
>  4U  
>  Sorcery  
>  Search your library for a permanent card with converted mana cost 1 or less and put it into play. If you do, the next permanent that comes into play under an opponent's control comes into play as a copy of that card.  
>  Shuffle your library.
> 
> 
> 

This loose, top-down cycle of in-your-face tutors allows you to not just play permanents, but throw them at your opponent's forces. Note the mapping of colors to permanents: green-land, white-enchantment, black-artifact, red-creature, blue-any.

Rare cycle:


> 
> Weakness: Permanent (rare)  
>  U  
>  Enchantment—Aura  
>  Enchant permanent  
>  When ~ comes into play, draw 2 cards.  
>  When ~ leaves play, you lose the game.  
>  ~ is indestructible.
> 
> 
> Weakness: Enchantment （rare)  
>  W  
>  Enchantment—Aura  
>  Enchant enchantment  
>  When ~ comes into play, gain 10 life.  
>  When ~ leaves play, you lose the game.  
>  ~ is indestructible.
> 
> 
> Weakness: Artifact （rare）  
>  B  
>  Enchantment—Aura  
>  Enchant artifact  
>  When ~ comes into play, each opponent discards a card, then discards a card at random.  
>  When ~ leaves play, you lose the game.  
>  ~ is indestructible.
> 
> 
> Weakness: Creature (rare)  
>  R  
>  Enchantment—Aura  
>  Enchant creature  
>  When ~ comes into play, destroy target land.  
>  When ~ leaves play, you lose the game.  
>  ~ is indestructible.
> 
> 
> Weakness: Land (rare)  
>  G  
>  Enchantment—Aura  
>  Enchant land  
>  When ~ comes into play, put a 3/3 green Spirit creature token into play.  
>  When ~ leaves play, you lose the game.  
>  ~ is indestructible.

This cycle embodies a classic fantasy archetype. As a subtheme, I repeat the (color-&gt;permanent type) cycle structure I used with the uncommons. These cards are similar to the Circles of Protection in more than name; sideboard in Weakness: Enchantment against black/red.

Aaron: I really like Aaron's commons. They do something neat that would absolutely lead to interesting play decisions. His uncommons are also really neat and would lead to cool deckbuilding decisions, and they have interesting flavor as well. As for his rares… yuck. Mark's instructions basically said that rare cycles exist to sell sets, and these cards wouldn't do that at all. Too many of this week's batch—not just Aaron's—try to “sell” cards with gigantic negatives—and not fun negatives, either. Stuff like “your creature dies” or “you lose the game” barely make up for whatever upside the cards have. Yes, if you're *really* into the game and love solving puzzles and balancing risk and reward, cards like Aaron's rares might interest you. But most people want all upside in their rare cycles. Anyway, two out of three good cycles puts Aaron in good standing with me.

Devin: Last week, Aaron was too subtle and too complicated. This week was much better. Common was a fantastic idea, executed well. 1-mana activation might be better. Great job. The uncommons had awesome flavor and since the cycle is so loose, each card has the freedom to be what it wants to be. Another awesome hit. The rares were bad – making 5 cards with lose the game is a bad idea. And they're so swingy when they work “![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)[Stupor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stupor)??” “![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)[Stone Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain)??” that when they get cast the game isn't fun at all, and when their drawback kicks in, that's not fun at all either. Still among the best this week on the strength of the first 2. 7 out of 10.

Gleemax:  
 Common – Interesting. Not common, but interesting.  
 Uncommon – I like it but it's all over the board.  
 Rare – You win for making the mechanic most likely to be hated by the public.  
 Good arm, bad control.

**Auratide Enchantments – Common**  
 I created this cycle to actively reward the “build your own monster” impulse, instead of hiding its disadvantages. In addition to creating Akroma-esque monstrosities at the dinner table, Auratide could create a fun Limited archtype. Templating came last, allowing Auratide's printing on non-Auras and adding the number for easy tweaks.


> 
> Angelic Presence (Common)  
>  1W  
>  Enchantment – Aura  
>  Enchant creature  
>  Whenever enchanted creature deals damage, you gain that much life.

**Five Heralds – Uncommon**  
 Enemy color design space is largely untapped, so I focused this cycle on it. First came flavor, then color-appropriate abilities that “warp the battlefield with their presence.” They're balanced on the bomb side for Limited, to create interesting deckbuilding opportunities in an environment without enemy color support.


> 
> Herald of Chaos (Uncommon)  
>  2UR  
>  Creature – Spirit Knight  
>  2/2  
>  As long as CARDNAME is attacking, whenever an opponent plays an instant spell, you may copy that spell. If you do, you may choose new targets for the copy.

>  2GB  
>  Creature – Spirit Knight  
>  2/2  
>  As long as CARDNAME is attacking, whenever a nontoken creature is put into a graveyard from play, you may put a 1/1 green Saproling token into play.
> 
> 
> Herald of Storms (Uncommon)  
>  2UG  
>  Creature – Spirit Knight  
>  2/2  
>  As long as CARDNAME is attacking, whenever a land is tapped for mana, return it to its owner's hand.
>

>  2/2

**Astral Sorceries – Rare**  
 These cards represent the rare, linear end of an astral theme and are written assuming that reminder text isn't essential. I wanted to explore players' willingness to rearrange cards removed from the game (unlike those in graveyards). Also, Whisper's once per turn limit should encourage interesting play and deck choices.


> 
> Beyond the Gate (Rare)  
>  2G  
>  Astral Sorcery  
>  Search your library for any number of astral land cards and remove them from the game. Then shuffle your library. Remove CARDNAME from the game.  
>  Whisper – 1GG: Put target astral land card you own that's removed from the game into play. (During your upkeep you may activate one Whisper ability from a card you own that is removed from the game.)
> 
> 
> Call of the Gatekeeper (Rare)  
>  3WW  
>  Astral Sorcery  
>  Remove all astral creatures and CARDNAME from the game.  
>  Whisper - 4WWW: Put a legendary X/X white Angel creature token with flying named The Gatekeeper into play, where X is the number of astral cards you own removed from the game. (During your upkeep you may activate one Whisper ability from a card you own that is removed from the game.)
> 
> 
> Gatekeeper's Wisdom (Rare)  
>  XUU

Aaron: Landon's cards didn't quite do it for me. His common enchantments might work fine in Limited, but they feel a lot like the “dragon parts” from Scourge. That said, they may be fun and do leave the door open for deckbuilders. Landon's uncommons failed to deliver on the “Limited bomb” status he trumpeted; with several of them, your opponent has complete control on whether the ability ever goes off, and they can simply be blocked and killed like any other four-mana 2/2. His rares hinted strongly at a set that used a tone of cards with a new supertype, and all the cards are incredibly parasitic, which means that you can't use them in decks that aren't awash in the theme. We tried a similar thing with Arcane in Kamigawa, and those cards never gained much popularity.

Devin: Last week: “This submission suffered from having too many unfocused cards that did multiple things that had nothing to do which each other.” This week the commons were just okay; really similar to [Dragon Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Wings) and Soulshift. The heralds are bad designs. The UR and UG ones will never ever trigger. And he says he costed them as Limited bombs, but many are actually unplayable. The WB and WR ones were ok. The rares were a miss for me. I don't like cards that are best when you have only one card with that mechanic in your deck. A miss. 2 out of 10.

Gleemax:  
 Common – You like soulshift, I see.  
 Uncommon – These are painfully bad.   
 Rare – Design tip: Removing player interaction almost never works out.  
 Stop making cards that aren't fun to play.

And there we have our fifteen designers' first challenge. Join me next week (Friday!) when I review them and give three of the applicants the boot. Then you'll get a chance to see how the remaining twelve do on our second challenge (which will also result, a week later, in three more eliminations.)
