During the holiday rerun weeks, we are presenting some of the year's most popular Arcana articles. It was a challenge to narrow down to just ten, so we hope you enjoy this look back into 2013!

Let's talk about [Thespian's Stage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thespian%27s+Stage). As you may already know, "thespian" is a highfalutin' word for "actor," and the card shows two actors, well, acting:

Now, because this is Arcana, you may have already guessed that the actors are significant. In fact, they're acting out an important moment from the history of Ravnica. Let's look closer!

Agrus Kos, Wojek Veteran

It's [Szadek, Lord of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=89092) and [Agrus Kos, Wojek Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agrus+Kos%2C+Wojek+Veteran), from the original *Ravnica* block! And they're fighting, which means this is probably the moment when Agrus Kos arrests Szadek, breaking the Guildpact!


You can see what it's like to watch this play in [the Uncharted Realms article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/230) that previewed [Thespian's Stage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thespian%27s+Stage). And you can read the whole story of the original *Ravnica* Cycle in eBook form. More information is [right here](/en/articles/archive/magic-gathering-ebooks-2012-09-13).
