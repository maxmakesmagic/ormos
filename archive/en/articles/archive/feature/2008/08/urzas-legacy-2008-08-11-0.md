In this follow-up to the *Urza's Saga* set, the obsessed planeswalker continues his quest across Dominaria for artifacts capable of holding off the Phyrexian invasion. The Yavimaya forest reluctantly provides the seed to grow a flying ship which, along with the artifacts, are to become *Urza's Legacy*.


**Urza's Legacy. The resistance is building.**
