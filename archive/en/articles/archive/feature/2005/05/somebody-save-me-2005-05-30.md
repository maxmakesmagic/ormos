### [Release Tournament](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=events/magic/release)


Every competitive **Magic: the Gathering®** player has their weaknesses... their “kryptonite,” so to speak. And just like the famous meteor rock, all players’ vulnerabilities come in various shapes, sizes, and colors.\* It might be that some players are in great shape as a Constructed hero, smashing with the power of 20 normal players, but look more like a first-year sidekick when it comes to the Limited crime scene. Perhaps some may size up what cards are better than others in all formats far before anyone else has. Yet, at the same time, when a new card set arrives in town they can never resist the urge to play with many of the “bad” cards. Those cards almost seem to villain-monologue them; quoting out loud to them how they will single-handedly defeat any hopes of being utilized in a playable deck. Maybe there is a particular color or color combination that a dynamic duelist slings better than others. In return, the avenger seems to always meet his doom at the hands of certain diabolical spells or decks bent on causing death and failure to their chosen weapon of justice. 


No matter what crops up as the radioactive stone that affects one player or the other, ALL competitive **Magic: the Gathering** players eventually acquire their arch-nemesis. This villain mastermind or maniac continues to reappear time and time again to stop the glory of victory after victory. Now granted, for most players, this rival will be another local player. Heck, it could even be a small group in your area, say The League of Rising Younger **Magic** Players, or something similar. Ladies and gentlemen, at long last I have found my nemesis:


![Okiba-Gang Shinobi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Okiba-Gang+Shinobi)
> [Okiba-Gang Shinobi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Okiba-Gang+Shinobi)


Sure, he’s not the most powerful atrocity to ever plague someone, but O-G-wan-Shinobi has now officially knocked my block off one too many times. Somehow, he always seems to hit me upside the head when I only have two cards in my hand. If not, then it is when I have my best three cards in my entire deck in my hand. If that doesn’t happen, then he hits me on turns three and four instead… when I’m on the draw nonetheless. Or, if he’s feeling extra saucy, he will bounce my only two blockers back to my hand when it is currently empty from his earlier beatings. This is immediately followed by him doing a little rat dance on my head. I hatez that stupid rat dance of his dangnabit! 


For this reason, and this reason alone… I couldn’t be happier about the *Saviors of Kamigawa*™ Release tournaments. These gloriously much-anticipated tournaments are going to be Sealed events held by your local game store/tournament location the weekend *Saviors of Kamigawa* is available for sale. (That would be Friday, June 3; Saturday, June 4; or Sunday, June 5 for those of us in “the know.”) 


Cross your fingers and check out this [link](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=events/magic/release) to see if your local store/tournament location will be participating. And if they’re not, then ask them why and ask them to make sure they get involved in the next Release event! Stores need to know that their players want things after all. 


Entry fees will vary from location to location, so check with your local tournament organizer for those details. Regardless of the cost, all entry fees include one *Champions of Kamigawa*™ tournament pack and two *Saviors of Kamigawa* boosters. That’s right… no [Okiba-Gang Shinobi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Okiba-Gang+Shinobi) at these events! Now you understand why I am so excited. Well, that and the fact I get to play some great **Magic: the Gathering** Limited games with my friends, and with new cards to boot! 


The *Saviors of Kamigawa* Release tournament will be a modified Swiss-style Sealed, 40 card minimum deck event. It will be sanctioned by DCI®, so you can build up your rating and have fun! Again, no Ninjas will be present to take points away from my… I mean your rating.


What’s more is that there will also be prizes. Lots to be exact! For starters, the first 32 players each receive a *Saviors of Kamigawa* Release foil promo card. And you know it won't be a discarding venomous Rat Ninja! So what’s not to like?


The top three finishers also each receive one of the following life counters:



On top of that, additional booster packs of *Saviors of Kamigawa* will be given to the top four finishers in the Release tournament. That’s right! You get to go play a local sanctioned event with new cards, get a free foil promo card, have a chance to win a cool life counter, and can walk away with some free *Saviors of Kamigawa* booster packs! 


So, go and get some practice with the new mechanics in *Saviors*! Go and have fun! Go see what the hype is about “Epic,” “Kirins,” and “Sweep”! Most of all, go and enjoy the fact that there will be no Rat Ninjas stalking in dark alleys waiting to spring upon you and wreck any chance you have at winning a game. 


Please… somebody save me from the rats! 


\* In **Magic** terms, the color blue obviously fills the role of your everyday standard occurrence of green kryptonite. At least if you were to ask most players. If you were to ask me, green kryptonite is replaced every block by some ridiculous combination of cards in Limited games that reoccur on the other side of the board against me in far more games than they ever should. For instance, I lost count of the number of times in *Onslaught™* block that I stared down a [Butcher Orgg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+Orgg) with [Mythic Proportions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mythic+Proportions) on it. Currently, *Kamigawa™* block seems to continue to grant my opponents with the foresight to draft blue-red knowing they are going to open both [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror) and [Kumano, Master Yamabushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%2C+Master+Yamabushi). 


*John started playing **Magic** back when Antiquities came out. He is a frequent top 8 finisher at PTQs and States using non-archetype decks and is a Regional Coordinator for the Delegate program. He also wants to say he has the most amazing girlfriend a gamer like him can ever hope for and he would like add that it’s not wise to upset a Rat Ninja.*
