![Selenia, Dark Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Selenia%2C+Dark+Angel)**[Selenia, Dark Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selenia%2C+Dark+Angel)** – *Tempest* rare. The tragic story of Crovax, from the *Weatherlight* saga, includes his unrequited love for Selenia, the angel set to guard over him. After injuring Mirri, Selenia allows Crovax to kill her... and in doing so she finalizes the Phyrexian curse that turns him into a vampire. 
 


![Deathpact Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Deathpact+Angel)**[Deathpact Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathpact+Angel)** – *Gatecrash* mythic rare. The Deathpact inexorably links these powerful Orzhovian angels with the clerics of a secretive and legendary order within the Syndicate. Read more about them, their bound clerics, and the Deathpact in Adam Lee's short story, "[Behind the Black Sun](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/240)." 
 


![Pillory of the Sleepless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pillory+of+the+Sleepless)**[Pillory of the Sleepless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillory+of+the+Sleepless)** – *Guildpact* common. A pillory is a punishment device that secures the prisoner's head and hands within a wood, metal, or (in this case) magical frame, for the purpose of public humiliation. Pilloried prisoners were often pelted by an assortment of unpleasant things. It's no wonder a person held within couldn't sleep! 
 


![Orzhov Pontiff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Orzhov+Pontiff)**[Orzhov Pontiff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orzhov+Pontiff)** – *Guildpact* rare. Service to the Orzhov Syndicate doesn't end with something as insignificant as death, as haunt, the original Orzhov mechanic, expresses. And, clearly, as the pontiff shows, dying while in the service of Orzhov can actually give you some additional powers. 
 


![Obzedat, Ghost Council](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Obzedat%2C+Ghost+Council)**[Obzedat, Ghost Council](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%2C+Ghost+Council)** – *Gatecrash* mythic rare. The Orzhov guild is ruled by the Obzedat, a council of ghostly autocrats who have maintained their wealth and power even as they've shed their mortal forms. Members of the Obzedat are called the Deathless, as they have managed to cheat mortality, maintaining their consciousness (and their greed) beyond the threshold of death. The Obzedat rarely speak directly with those outside the guild; instead, they communicate through the official Grand Envoy, [Teysa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teysa) Karlov. 
 


![Breathstealer's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Breathstealer%27s+Crypt)**[Breathstealer's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breathstealer%27s+Crypt)** – *Visions* rare. Long before we first arrived on Ravnica and learned of the guilds, [Breathstealer’s Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breathstealer%E2%80%99s+Crypt) was doing exactly what Dimir’s current guildmaster wants. If you play Commander with [Lazav](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lazav), definitely look to include this card as a tool to help your opponents make the right decision about every creature they draw. 
 


![Circu, Dimir Lobotomist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Circu%2C+Dimir+Lobotomist)**[Circu, Dimir Lobotomist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circu%2C+Dimir+Lobotomist)** – *Ravnica* rare. Circu was the Dimir Champion during the original *Ravnica* block. What happened to him since [Szadek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Szadek) fell and Dimir reorganized? Is he still around? If so where is he in the Dimir? He'd have aged some but I imagine he can still lobotomize with the best of them. 
 


![Dimir Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dimir+Charm)**[Dimir Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Charm)** – *Gatecrash* uncommon. Of all of the Charms from *Return to Ravnica* and *Gatecrash*, the Dimir charm is the only one that is not a physical charm and is instead done by perspective and negative space. 
 


![Soul Ransom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soul+Ransom)**[Soul Ransom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Ransom)** – *Gatecrash* rare. When you list off valuable things, your soul has to be up there right near the top. I mean sure some might trade it for a golden fiddle, but with this card you’re just asking your opponent to trade two cards from their hand. Is that so much to ask? 
 


![Lazav, Dimir Mastermind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lazav%2C+Dimir+Mastermind)**[Lazav, Dimir Mastermind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lazav%2C+Dimir+Mastermind)** – *Gatecrash* mythic rare. The Dimir needed someone to lead them after [Szadek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Szadek) was defeated. Who better to lead the once secret guild than a shapeshifter perfectly suited for infiltrating Ravnica? 
 


![Millennial Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Millennial+Gargoyle)**[Millennial Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millennial+Gargoyle)** – *Gatecrash* common. All of the [Gargoyles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&block=%7C%5B%22Ravnica%20Block%22%5D&subtype=+%5B%22Gargoyle%22%5D) in the original Ravnica Block had abilities in addition to the flying that comes with being a gargoyle. But none of them are still around, are they? Maybe if you want to last a thousand years, you want to keep it simple. 
 


![Thousand-Year Elixir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thousand-Year+Elixir)**[Thousand-Year Elixir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thousand-Year+Elixir)** – *Lorwyn* rare. [Thousand-Year Elixir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thousand-Year+Elixir) does not actually grant haste, which means that it won't let creatures attack on the same turn they entered the battlefield. But that's not really a problem, because what it's usually doing is enabling some sort of crazy combo. 
 


![Thousand-Legged Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thousand-Legged+Kami)**[Thousand-Legged Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thousand-Legged+Kami)** – *Champions of Kamigawa* uncommon. In Kamigawa block, there was a war between the material world and the spiritual world. Originally, each of the kami was a divinity, and the way to happiness was to honor them and live by their ways. But when they started to take material form and ravage everything, things had to change. 
 


![One Thousand Lashes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=One+Thousand+Lashes)**[One Thousand Lashes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+Thousand+Lashes)** – *Gatecrash* uncommon. The art in [One Thousand Lashes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+Thousand+Lashes) shows the magic of foreshortening. The tip of the whip is visible in the foreground, but once it's out of the frame, it goes all the way back to the hand of the Orzhov in the background. 
 


![Death of a Thousand Stings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings)**[Death of a Thousand Stings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* common. [Death of a Thousand Stings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings) is unlikely to be used a thousand times in a single match, both because it would seem to require a thousand turns to go off, and because the opponent would have died after about twenty stings. 
 


![1689](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1689)**[The Lady of the Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1689)** – *Legends* uncommon. Many of the cards in *Legends* were based on the **D&D** game of *Legends* designer Steve Conard. Back in 2002, he provided stats for [The Lady of the Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Lady+of+the+Mountain). [Enjoy](/en/articles/archive/magic-meets-dd-2002-03-08)! 
 


![Giant Solifuge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Giant+Solifuge)**[Giant Solifuge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Solifuge)** – *Guildpact* rare. A "solifuge" is an actual thing. It's also called a camel spider, a wind scorpion, or a sun spider. Even in the real world, they're kind of giant and scary. 
 


![Borborygmos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Borborygmos)**[Borborygmos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borborygmos)** – *Guildpact* rare. According to the flavor text on [Borborygmos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borborygmos), the only orders the guild leader gives are "Crush them!" and "We eat!" He says the first one on [Wreak Havoc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wreak+Havoc) and the second one on [Protean Hulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk). 
 


![Zhur-Taa Swine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zhur-Taa+Swine)**[Zhur-Taa Swine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zhur-Taa+Swine)** – *Gatecrash* common. The Zhur-Taa clan, also known as the "skull bleachers," is the only Gruul clan that claims to follow "the old ways." The Zhur-Taa are very close to their beasts; their shamans are adept at summoning and training beasts for war-companions and mounts. 
 


![Borborygmos Enraged](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Borborygmos+Enraged)**[Borborygmos Enraged](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borborygmos+Enraged)** – *Gatecrash* mythic rare. There are always some Gruul Clans that don't follow the guild leader. But Borborygmos has unified most of the clans and held his position as the Gruul's mightiest clan leader for several decades now and has killed many upstarts. 
 


![Enter the Dungeon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Enter+the+Dungeon)**[Enter the Dungeon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enter+the+Dungeon)** – *Unhinged* rare. [Enter the Dungeon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enter+the+Dungeon) has players start a new subgame under the table. But what if someone plays [Enter the Dungeon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enter+the+Dungeon) during that one? Well, according to  [the *Unhinged* FAQTIWDAWCC](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/faq/unhinged) , players should start the new subgame under *another* table. Just keep finding new tables!
