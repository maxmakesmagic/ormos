**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Spanish National Top 8, played five Pro Tours.



**What deck did you play and why? How did Fate Reforged influence your choice?**


The one my friends were able to lend me on Friday evening, which was White/Blue Heroic. Not sure how the set influenced that …



**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**


I prefer three [Erase](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erase)s and I'd remove the [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise)s from the sideboard. The main deck is fine.



**What is the most important card in your deck?**


[Favored Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite).

**Age**: 27

**Hometown:** Plzen, Czech Republic


**Clan:** Jeskai



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


With this Top 8 I just got over 400 Pro Points lifetime.



**What deck did you play and why? How did Fate Reforged influence your choice?**


Jeskai Aggro. I only had two days to prepare so I asked friends for help. Dave Shields gave me a great Jeskai list and I tuned it a little to fit my style. [Wild Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Slash), [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance), and [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege) are some great additions from Fate Reforged!



**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**


For now, none. It depends on how the metagame evolves during the next week.



**What is the most important card in your deck?**


It's really a combination of cheap removal and card advantage which makes the deck good, no specific card.

**Clan:** Abzan



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Day 2 at Pro Tour Journey into Nyx, Top 64 at Grand Prix Bilbao 2013.



**What deck did you play and why? How did Fate Reforged influence your choice?**


Red/Green Devotion/Monsters, which was the deck I knew the best and which performed the best.



**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**


I would play the third copy of [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws). It's too powerful!



**What is the most important card in your deck?**


[Genesis Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Hydra) and [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws).

### **Name**: Alexandre Habert


**Age**: 23 very soon


**Occupation:** Delivery man


**Hometown:** Toulouse, France


**Clan:** Sultai



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Some money finishes, in each of the possible Top X categories except for Top 8.



**What deck did you play and why? How did Fate Reforged influence your choice?**


Sidisi-Whip. I tested a lot with my team and it seemed the best deck to play in a metagame which we expected toi be very red-dominated.



**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**


Take [Stain the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stain+the+Mind) out of the sideboard to make room for two copies of [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker). [Stain the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stain+the+Mind) was not as good as expected. Not at all!



**What is the most important card in your deck?**


[Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant) tied with [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) of course.

**Age**: 26


**Occupation:** Engineer R&D


**Hometown:** Achères, France


**Clan:** Abzan



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Champion Grand Prix Amsterdam 2011, Grand Prix Rimini 2013 Top 8.



**What deck did you play and why? How did Fate Reforged influence your choice?**


Abzan Aggro because I wanted to play [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and I think the deck has the highest raw power. I actually didn't test with Fate Reforged.



**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**


Don't know yet. I need to practice Standard a bit more …



**What is the most important card in your deck?**


[Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino).
