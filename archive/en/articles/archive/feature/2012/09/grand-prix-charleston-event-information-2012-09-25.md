**Tournament Format**
  


* [Standard](/en/node/704561)
* Deck lists are required (download [blank deck list sheet here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/CONSTRUCTED_DECKLIST.pdf)).
* Players must use the same deck on Day 2 that they used on Day 1.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

**Staff**
  
 The Head Judge for this event is Jeff Morrow. The official staff application window has closed, if you still wish to volunteer for this event, want to discuss testing, or have other questions, please contact judge manager Bryan Prillaman at [bprill.MTG@gmail.com](mailto:bprill.MTG@gmail.com).
