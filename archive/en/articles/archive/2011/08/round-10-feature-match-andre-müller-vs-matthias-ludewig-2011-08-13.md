For this round, we wanted to see Andre Müller's mill deck in action. Or rather in inaction, because that's what it's all about: preventing action, especially combat action.



### Game One



Müller went off to a fast start with [Gideon's Lawkeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Lawkeeper) and [Jace's Erasure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure). Ludewig had [Duskhunter Bat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskhunter+Bat) and then no more play until turn five, when [Peregrine Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Griffin) joined the Bat. Müller himself had no further plays either, but his [Jace's Erasure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure) started working on Ludewig's library. [Duskhunter Bat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskhunter+Bat) got through for 1 point of damage. "Always the beginning of the end, especially in this format," Müller commented and was proved right by Ludewig's [Vampire Outcasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Outcasts).


Müller grimaced when he forgot the ability of [Jace's Erasure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure). Still, he wasn't too unhappy because now he wiped the board with [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment). Ludewig restocked with [Armored Warhorse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Warhorse), Müller cast [Mesa Enchantress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress) and [Ice Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage). But Ludewig had more: [Throne of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Empires) and [Griffin Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel) on the next turn. Müller had [Stonehorn Dignitary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonehorn+Dignitary), then [Merfolk Mesmerist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Mesmerist). The Mesmerist went into [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), but Müller had another.


Meanwhile [Throne of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Empires) had created four tokens. So far, however, [Griffin Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel) was the only creature that could attack profitably. Ludewig returned a milled [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) via [Auramancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer), but chose to wait for a better target.


"Well, if you want to enchant a *good* creature, you'll have to choose one of yours," Müller quipped. Despite [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) waiting in his opponent's hand, Müller decided to summon [Siege Mastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Mastodon) on his turn, which was prompty pacified on Ludewig's. Ludewig attacked with [Griffin Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel), five 1/1 tokens, and [Auramancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer). [Mesa Enchantress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress), [Stonehorn Dignitary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonehorn+Dignitary), and [Merfolk Mesmerist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Mesmerist) each blocked a token, killing two. Müller took 5 damage down to 12.


Müller cast [Æther Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) and re-cast his [Siege Mastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Mastodon). Again, Ludewig could only attack with his Griffin. [Jace's Erasure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure) and [Merfolk Mesmerist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Mesmerist) raced that clock comfortably.

### Game Two



The game started with [Blood Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Seeker) for Ludewig, [Merfolk Mesmerist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Mesmerist). Ludewig forgot [Blood Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Seeker)'s triggered ability, evening the score of forgotten triggers.


However, this time, Ludewig curved out nicely, with [Benalish Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Veteran) followed by [Bloodrage Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrage+Vampire). On turn four, Müller put a stop to those advances via [Æther Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept), simulataneously removing [Benalish Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Veteran) from immediate consideration and providing a fine blocker for [Bloodrage Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrage+Vampire).


Ludewig replayed [Benalish Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Veteran), Müller made [Stonehorn Dignitary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonehorn+Dignitary). Again, Ludewig forgot the [Blood Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Seeker) trigger to the general amusement of the watching crowd.


Ludewig still had no fourth land, to Müller's five, and simply played [Griffin Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel). Müller had no play on his turn, Ludewig had [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) for [Æther Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept), which allowed him to get through with [Bloodrage Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrage+Vampire) and [Griffin Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel), while [Benalish Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Veteran) ran into [Stonehorn Dignitary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonehorn+Dignitary).


Müller cast [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) on [Bloodrage Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrage+Vampire) and [Jace's Erasure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure). But Ludewig had [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) for Müller's 1/4 and got in for more damage. Müller had no play once again. Ludewig got in for yet more damage, and summoned [Stormfront Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus).


Müller had no [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) and that evened the more important (game) score.

### Game Three



Müller had to mulligan and went without turn-two play, while Ludewig made [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night). The Child was returned to its master's hand via [Æther Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) and Ludewig replaced it with [Bloodrage Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrage+Vampire). Müller summoned [Jace's Archivist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Archivist). [Bloodrage Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrage+Vampire) and [Æther Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) traded, then Ludewig cast [Griffin Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel). Müller cast [Crown of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Empires) and, during Ludewig's draw step, used [Jace's Archivist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Archivist) to trade in his three cards in hand for a new grip of six.


Unfortunately for Ludewig, those six included [Jace's Erasure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure). When Müller used [Jace's Archivist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Archivist) the next time to make both players draw another six cards, Ludewig lost an additional six to [Jace's Erasure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure), [Sorin's Thirst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%27s+Thirst) among them. This left Ludewig with but one out: [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) to remove [Jace's Archivist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Archivist). His next draw step didn't provide, and in the face of losing another 14 cards to the combination of [Archivist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archivist) and Erasure, he shrugged and picked up his cards.
