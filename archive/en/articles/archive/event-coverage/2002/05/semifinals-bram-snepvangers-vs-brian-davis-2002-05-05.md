Now he wants to see just how far he can take it. Davis is hoping to match or outdo his performance at Pro Tour-Chicago 1999 where he lost to Bob Maher in the final match.

### Game 1

Both players had some early creatures to cast, with Davis summoning a [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog) and Snepvangers matching wit [Soulcatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulcatcher). Neither played a creature on their third turn. "Nice," commented Davis when he saw Snepvangers play a third land type in that many turns. [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) was up next on American's side of the table, spelling certain doom for the [Soulcatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulcatcher). Snepvangers cast [Aven Cloudchaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser) and traded it in combat for the Dog, leaving nothing but [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) in play.

Snepvangers summoned a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), and Davis matched with [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot), leaving enough mana untapped to activate his [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger). Getting through for any damage on the ground may be difficult with [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) in the equation, so Snepvangers could concentrate on the offense – he tapped out to play [Soul Scourge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Scourge).

Davis tapped out for a monster of his own – casting a [Crazed Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crazed+Firecat). Much coin flipping ensued, as the judge tried hard to let the coin fall on the actual tabletop. When smoke cleared, Firecat was 7/7, and Snepvangers was at least somewhat scared.

Snepvangers cast nothing next turn, with five mana untapped and five cards in hand – clearly representing [Second Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts) – but did he have it, or was he bluffing, hoping to convince Davis not to attack for a turn? Davis chose to attack with both of his creatures. Snepvangers did in fact have [Second Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts). He used it on the Firecat but took two points of damage from the Zealot rather than risking his [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Davis summoned [Militant Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Militant+Monk) and [Stern Judge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stern+Judge) and played another land, able to activate his [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger).

Snepvangers played a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp). He now had two [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s, two [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s, and two [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) in play! He cast [Morbid Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger) on the [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) and attacked. It was looking very grim for Davis, but he managed to top-deck [Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter). He attacked with two creatures, cycled [Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter) on [Militant Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Militant+Monk), forcing Snepvangers to remove two cards in his graveyard from the game in the bargain, and draw [Aven Flock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock) off the [Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter)! All of a sudden, not only was Davis back in this game, but it was looking suddenly grim for the Dutch player.

Snepvangers took a five-minute turn deciding how and when to use his cards. He ended up casting [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and then thinking some more. He attacked. Davis, at nine life, chose not to block. With no cards in hand, he could not bluff anything at all. Snepvangers discarded five cards to the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and removed his graveyard from the game to make it 10/11.

"I am awful," was all Davis could say before scooping up his cards.

### Game 2

Davis drew a one-land hand and was forced to take a mulligan. He had nothing to play before a turn 4 [Petravark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petravark). In the mean time, Snepvangers summoned [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and Skywind Aven, and was swinging with both while his [Angelic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall) was holding down the fort. Davis drew nothing but land. He cast his only other spell in hand – a [Reckless Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge), and attacked for five unblocked.

Snepvangers summoned [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), but Davis slowed down the beating with [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot). Snepvangers kept attacking in the air with [Skywing Aven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywing+Aven) and a freshly summoned [Aven Cloudchaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser) – while Davis drew yet another land. Davis was forced to chump-block the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) next turn. He drew another land and conceded. Davis drew a total of three spells and ten lands that game.

"I am America's last hope," Davis commented about the fact that all other players in the top 4 were from Europe. "Poor them."

### Game 3

Snepvangers took a restroom break, so Jeff Donais took this opportunity to come over and give Davis a combination of a pep talk and a tongue lashing for his bad play in game 1. His back to the wall, Davis would now need to win three games straight in order to advance to the finals.

[Mystic Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Visionary) and [Militant Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Militant+Monk) gave Davis an early advantage, but Snepvangers' [Hypochondria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypochondria) made the late game prospects less than spectacular. Snepvangers threw away a land to prevent the damage on turn 3 and then cast [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) to regain card economy. Davis summoned [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer). He then enchanted [Militant Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Militant+Monk) with [Crackling Club](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Club), bringing Snepvangers down to eleven life points. 

Snepvangers played a fifth land but cast nothing, once again representing [Second Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts). Davis was under no pressure to test him this time around. He summoned [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) and passed the turn. He could also have attacked with his one toughness creatures and used [Crackling Club](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Club) on one of them in case Snepvangers did indeed have [Second Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts), but decided to play conservatively. At the end of his turn, Snepvangers used [Waste Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waste+Away) to kill [Militant Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Militant+Monk) – either he still had [Second Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts) in hand, or his bluff worked quite well.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptnice02/a672.jpg)[Morbid Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger) on the [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer) came next. Davis took advantage of his opponent being tapped out to cast [Reckless Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge) twice, bringing Snepvangers down to four life points.

Snepvangers sacrificed [Hypochondria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypochondria) to prevent combat damage next turn. He did so because the only creature in his hand was [Aven Cloudchaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser), which he cast on the following turn. Davis removed it with [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) and attacked for the win.

### Game 4

Once again, Davis drew a one-land hand and took a mulligan. The new hand was very reasonable, allowing Davis to summon [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot) on turn 2 and [Militant Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Militant+Monk) on turn 3 – but Snepvangers took no early damage as he summoned [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and then cast [Think Tank](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Tank).

Davis cast [Reckless Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge) on the Visionary and attacked with both creatures. Snepvangers blocked a Monk and Davis tapped it to prevent a point, resulting in Snepvangers going five life points down. Snepvangers cast [Hypochondria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypochondria) on his next turn. Davis attacked with both creatures again, repeating the same process to sneak in two damage, and summoned [Pardic Lancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Lancer). 

Snepvangers spent a turn casting [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), with one mana up. Davis attacked and Snepvangers did what he probably should have done two turns ago – blocked [Militant Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Militant+Monk), discarded a card to make [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) 3/1, put damage on the stack, and flipped it back over to 1/3 again. He was now at eight life. Before ending the turn, Davis summoned a [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot).

Snepvangers passed the turn back to Davis, so Davis cast [Reckless Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge) on the Zealot and attacked. Snepvangers tapped out for [Second Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts), and Davis finally got to use his [Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter), saving it. Forced to chump block the Zealot with [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba), Snepvangers went down to five life points. Snepvangers did not draw any creatures that could deal damage – he played out a couple of [Angelic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall)s and was quickly losing cards to [Hypochondria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypochondria). He could not keep it up for long. Down to one life point, he sacrificed [Hypochondria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypochondria) and cast [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise) to take out a [Pardic Lancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Lancer), finally stabilizing the game.   
 Although Snepvangers had [Think Tank](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Tank) in play, he was down at a very low life total. [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) or [Volcanic Spray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Spray) would likely finish the game. Davis cast [Mystic Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Visionary) and [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog) on the following turn. He could attack with all of his creatures and one would get through, assuming Snepvangers did not cast another blocker or have a trick. An opportunity would have passed a turn later because [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog) would be forced to attack anyway. 

Snepvangers cast nothing, so Davis attacked with a pair of Visionaries, a Zealot (all flying) and the [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog), holding back the Healer. Snepvangers pumped [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), used [Gallantry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gallantry) on one of the Walls and finally used [Embolden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embolden). The end result of all this was [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog) heading to the graveyard and status quo being resumed. Snepvangers cast [Psionic Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift) on the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and killed off the Healer. He also used the [Embolden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embolden) out of the graveyard to stave off death for a turn. Davis cast a [Savage Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Firecat) and won a pair of coin flips, making it 6/6 – but Snepvangers was in control of the board far as creatures were concerned now. However, Davis drawing any burn spell could immediately end the game. 

After several more exhausting turns, Davis finally drew [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger), cast it, and put Snepvangers out of his misery.

### Game 5

Snepvangers made sure he would not be taking any combat damage early by playing out a pair of [Angelic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall)s. Davis cast [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger); ready to chip slowly at the Dutch player's life total as he was building up his army of creatures. The game was promising to be a long one, as [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer) entered play on the opposite sides of the table and Davis cast [Hypochondria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypochondria) to go along with it. 

Snepvangers enchanted one of his Walls with [Psionic Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift), taking out the Healer. The two Tims could now race against each other. This went on for many turns, with occasional extra creatures entering play to muddy up the waters even further. Finally, Snepvangers made his move, casting [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise) on the [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger). 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptnice02/a674.jpg)"There goes the game, boys" commented Davis, who did not have a [Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter) in hand. [Aven Flock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock) was very helpful at holding off Snepvanger's flyers, but [Psionic Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift) was doing its job, one point at the time. Davis cast another "Tim" of sorts – [Stern Judge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stern+Judge). Snepvangers had one [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) in play, so the Judge could match [Psionic Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift) damage for damage. Snepvangers had many more creatures in play at this point but Davis could buy time with [Hypochondria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypochondria), so the game remained as complicated as ever. 

After a few more turns, Snepvangers cast [Aven Cloudchaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser). Both players realized that both of their annoying enchantments would be going away – Davis would sacrifice [Hypochondria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypochondria) in response and force the Cloudchaser ability to destroy the only enchantment remaining in play – [Psionic Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift). Snepvangers's numerous creatures were far more of a threat now that the super Healing Salve generator was out of the equation.  
 Snepvangers attacked with four flyers and a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), leaving back just a pair of Walls. Davis blocked a Cloudchaser with [Aven Flock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock) and threw several creatures in front of [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Snepvangers discarded several cards and removed almost his entire graveyard from the game to kill the blockers, and used [Embolden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embolden) to make sure he'd lose no creatures. Suddenly, the game was swinging heavily in his favor.

Two more attacks in the air, and Davis offered his hand in concession.

**Final Result:** Snepvangers 3 – Davis 2
