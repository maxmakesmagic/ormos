Revised Reprint Policy
======================

By Wizards of the Coast











Wizards of the Coast recently previewed [Phyrexian Negator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Negator) and [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) as premium cards that will appear in 2010 **Magic**® products. Although our reprint policy allows for these premium versions, concern from the community about future reprints has prompted us to alter the policy.

Below are all premium versions of reserved-list cards that will be released in 2010: 

***Duel Decks: Phyrexia vs. the Coalition* (March 19)**  
[Phyrexian Negator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Negator)

***From the Vault: Relics* (August 27)**  
[Karn, Silver Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn%2C+Silver+Golem)  
[Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore)  
[Memory Jar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Jar)  
[Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond)

**Judge Promos (various)**  
[Phyrexian Dreadnought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought)  
[Morphling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morphling)  
[Thawing Glaciers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thawing+Glaciers)  
[Wheel of Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+of+Fortune)

These premium cards will be produced and distributed as specified. Thereafter, Wizards of the Coast will not print any physical, reserved-list card in a tournament-legal version, either in premium or non-premium form.
