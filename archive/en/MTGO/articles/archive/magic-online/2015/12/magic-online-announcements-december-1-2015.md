**Announcing the Modern Mayhem Event**

**Season 12 *Magic Online* Championship Series Preliminaries Begin Tomorrow**


The Season 12 *Magic Online* Championship Series (MOCS) Preliminaries begin tomorrow, December 2, and run through December 4. Five or six wins in a MOCS Preliminary earns players 35 Qualifier Points (QPs), which earns you entry into the MOCS Season 12 Finals on November 5!


Whether you've been saving QPs up all season long, or you turned 15 into 35 via one of this week's MOCS Season Preliminaries, you'll want to be sure to compete in the MOCS Season Finals. Big Prizes are up for grabs, including an invitation to the Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*!


And remember! This is the last season of the 2015 MOCS. There are still 2015 Last Chance Qualifiers to come, but if you want to get in on the 2016 MOCS, then start planning now and read up on some of the changes to the MOCS [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/autocard-test-2015-11-12).

**Upcoming *Battle for Zendikar* Sealed PTQ on Sunday, December 6**


Attention all Pro Tour hopefuls, a Pro Tour Qualifier (PTQ) is approaching! The *Battle for Zendikar* Sealed Pro Tour Qualifier Preliminaries begin tomorrow, December 3, and run through Sunday, December 6. We hope to see you in the PTQ Finals on Sunday, December 6!


Remember, you are no longer required to enter into the PTQ Finals immediately following the Preliminary that you qualified through thanks to the new PTQ system that Lee Sharpe announced in his latest [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-qualifier-changes-2015-11-16).

**Prerelease Object and Warmark Removal**


We've received a lot of player feedback about untradeable objects adding clutter to player collections. We will be removing entry objects for past set prereleases as well as Mirran and Phyrexian Warmarks from collections during the Wednesday, December 2 downtime as we have no plans to use these objects for future events.

***Legendary Cube* and *Commander (2015 Edition)* Known Issues**


**Gameplay**


* Cardset | [Caged Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caged+Sun)’s mana ability incorrectly doesn't trigger when a land is tapped for an ability that produces more than one mana.
* Cardset | Abilities that generate replacement effects preventing specific cards from being put into graveyards (such as those found on [Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) or [Blightsteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus)) do not function properly while resolving [Grenzo, Dungeon Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grenzo%2C+Dungeon+Warden)'s activated ability.
* Cardset | All legendary creature cards in all zones owned by a player who controls a [Heroes' Podium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroes%27+Podium) incorrectly receive the power/toughness bonus from its first ability.
* Cardset | [Kumano, Master Yamabushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%2C+Master+Yamabushi)'s ability does not cause creature cards to be exiled instead of being put into the graveyard.
* Cardset | [Myriad Landscape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myriad+Landscape)’s activated ability incorrectly allows a player to put two basic lands that do not share a land type onto the battlefield.
* Cardset | [Kurkesh, Onakke Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kurkesh%2C+Onakke+Ancient) does not copy activated abilities of artifacts that sacrifice as part of their activation cost.
* Cardset | Cards cast with conspire that require a player to sacrifice a creature as an additional cost to cast, such as [Life's Legacy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life%27s+Legacy) and [Momentous Fall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentous+Fall), incorrectly look at the power and toughness of the last creature clicked for conspire.
* Cardset | [Villainous Wealth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth)'s prompt box text incorrectly suggests that the caster must cast all appropriate exiled spells. This is a display issue only. The Cancel button allows the player to continue without casting remaining spells.
* Cardset | Copying [All Suns' Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Suns%27+Dawn) sometimes causes a crash.
* Cardset | Casting [Ray of Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Command) without paying its mana cost, via a spell or ability such as cascade or [Mizzix's Mastery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzix%27s+Mastery), incorrectly requires the player to pay the mana cost.

* General | Several bugs not listed elsewhere that caused crashes have been resolved.

**Gameplay**


* Duel scene | Images associated with certain triggers no longer appear to untap when put onto the stack.
* Cardset | Casting “pitch” cards—cards that involve an alternative casting cost that involves a player exiling a number of cards from his or her hand, such as [Soul Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Spike) or [Fury of the Horde](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+of+the+Horde)—once again require the correct number of cards to be exiled to pay those costs.

* Cardset | [Illusory Ambusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusory+Ambusher) and numerous other cards with abilities that trigger upon being dealt damage now correctly display blue text indicating the amount of damage dealt.
* Duel Scene | Players can no longer right-click on the commander of an opponent and be presented with a non-functional context menu with zone change options.
* Cardset | Colorless mana in a player’s mana pool is no longer automatically applied to a converge spell’s mana cost.
* Cardset | Using [Jace, Telepath Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Telepath+Unbound)’s second loyalty ability on a split card in the graveyard now correctly causes that card to be exiled after being cast.

**Look and Feel**


* Duel Scene | Manifested premium cards no longer obscure the artist name in zoom view.
