Welcome back to "On the Mirrodin Site," where we show off some of the recent highlights from the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/).


This week, the most important addition is the **Orb of Insight** for *Mirrodin Besieged*. Here's how the Orb works: You enter any word, and the Orb will tell you how many times that word appears in the set. It counts all text on the cards with the exception of flavor text.


For *Mirrodin Besieged*, we've thrown in a twist. The Phyrexians get to look at the Mirran cards, and the Mirrans get to look at the Phyrexian cards. This means that there are *two* Orbs of Insight, each with its own set of data. Also, any card that has neither a Phyrexian nor a Mirran watermark won't show up in either one.


The orbs are tucked away in the Mirrodin Site, where they're kind of hard to link to. But [this should work](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#mountains,hotspots;R2;0;) for the Mirrans' Orb (which looks at the Phyrexians), and clicking "Change Faction" should flip it to the Phyrexians' Orb (which looks at the Mirrans).


Enjoy!
