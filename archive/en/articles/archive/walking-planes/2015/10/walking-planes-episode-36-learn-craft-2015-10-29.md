This week's Walking the Planes features the acting chops of the last two Pro Tour winners: Joel Larsson and Martin Dang. If that doesn't excite you, there's also a dramatic moment at the annual Hall of Fame dinner, the brave story of Pro Tour player Brandon Burton, and the wise teachings of "Coach Luis." And whatever you do, keep watching to the end of the credits!
