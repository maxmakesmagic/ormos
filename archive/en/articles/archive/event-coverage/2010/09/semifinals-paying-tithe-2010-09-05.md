Michael Jacob vs. Paul Rietzl
-----------------------------


The all-American Semifinals had Michael Jacob pitted against Paul Rietzl. It was the second Pro Tour Top 8 for Rietzl and the first for former U.S. National Champ Jacob.


### Game 1


Rietzl got off to a blisteringly fast start. He summoned [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx) on turn one, cracked [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa) on turn two to put Jacob at 16, cast [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny), and made that a 2/2. Jacob shot [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx) with [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire). Rietzl made his Figure 4/4 and attacked. Jacob cast [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and [Terminate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate); gone was the Figure, but Rietzl had a new one as well as a [Student of Warfare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Student+of+Warfare). Jacob made [Coalition Relic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Relic) and hit the second Figure with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt).

[Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) was up next for Rietzl, who then levelled [Student of Warfare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Student+of+Warfare) twice and attacked for 3 damage to put Jacob at 9. Rietzl passed his turn with one card left in hand and one [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) untapped. He sat back in his chair and put the one card face-down on the table.


Jacob charged his [Coalition Relic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Relic) at end of turn, which allowed him to cast the infamous turn-five [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum). Rietzl smiled and slowly turned over the face-down card ... [Mana Tithe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Tithe)!


Rietzl 1, Jacob 0


### Game 2


Rietzl started with [Burrenton Forge-Tender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Forge-Tender) on turn one, then got his [Student of Warfare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Student+of+Warfare)[Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed, but resolved a [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny). [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) tried to remove the Figure, but the Forge-Tender heroically sacrificed itself to prevent that.


On his next turn, Rietzl cast [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) before playing a land, and followed it up with [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure). Jacob used [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) to find [Grove of the Burnwillows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows) and proceeded to shoot the same [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) with the same [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) again, this time to death.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptams10/sf2_jacob.jpg)*The hat conceals hall.*
Rietzl just cast a second [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) and attacked with his now 4/4 Knight to put Jacob at 12. Jacob drew a card and passed the turn right back to Rietzl who made [Ranger of Eos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos), searching up one Student and one Figure.


Jacob had [Consume the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek) in hand, but no good answer to a 5/4 Ranger. He tried to kill it with the combined powers of [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) and his [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit), but [Brave the Elements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brave+the+Elements) thwarted that plan. Meanwhile the [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) had taken Jacob down to just 4 life. Rietzl kept up the pressure with [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession) so that only [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) could save Jacob. He went looking with [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). . . and a second [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). . . and picked up his cards for the third game.


Rietzl 2, Jacob 0


### Game 3


Jacob played first but—not unexpectedly—Rietzl had the first actual play, once again starting out on [Burrenton Forge-Tender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Forge-Tender). He made [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) on his second turn, while Jacob only played a second [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit).


Rietzl summoned a [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) and [Student of Warfare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Student+of+Warfare) on his third turn; Jacob shot the Knight with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). Jacob tried [Volcanic Fallout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout) but [Burrenton Forge-Tender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Forge-Tender) saved the Student.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptams10/sf2_rietzl.jpg)*You can never have too many cards.*
A second [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) made it onto the battlefield and the Student itself made it to level two. Rietzl also summoned [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx), just in case. Unless, of course, that case was [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation). The black sorcery killed everything, but Rietzl came back with [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession) and a third [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), to which Jacob responded with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) targeting one of the tokens.


"Oh, that was bad," Rietzl scolded himself. If he had cast the spells the other way round, 3 damage would not have been enough to kill any of his tokens. It didn't matter, though, as the 4/4 Spirits quickly took the game and match.


**Paul Rietzl bests Michael Jacob 3-0 and advances to the Finals of Pro Tour–Amsterdam 2010!**
