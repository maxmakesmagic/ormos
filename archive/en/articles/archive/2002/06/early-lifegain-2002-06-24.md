Sometimes it's fun to look back at Richard Garfield's original playtest cards; they have a great amount of mystique and lore about them. Must be the silly clipart.


Keeping with the theme, here are four Alpha cards that deal with gaining life. My favorite is [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) -- "One creature takes up farming"! You can click on each card to see the real Beta version.
