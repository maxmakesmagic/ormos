In Ravnica, owning an umbrella isn’t nearly enough. Today we take a flavorful look at the atmospheric conditions of weather-torn Ravnica.Several cards show us how tumultuous Ravnica’s climate can be. What conditions might a nervous [skyrider trainee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=skyrider+trainee) want to watch out for?

|  *There’s plenty to talk about in the marketplaces of Ravnica, be it the latest feud between guilds or the terrible weather.**- [Rain of Embers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rain+of+Embers)* |

Centuries of Ravnican business—powered in many cases by [Izzet boilerworks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+boilerworks) and other guilds’ foundries—have saturated Ravnica’s atmosphere with all manner of industrial pollution. [Smogsteed Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smogsteed+Riders) may take advantage of this fact, but the **[Caustic Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caustic+Rain)** is a grim result that eats away not just umbrellas but entire districts.

Izzet ingenuity is responsible for another type of weird weather—and we mean that literally. In the card **[Thunderheads](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderheads)**, we see some of the sentries used to protect the entrances to Izzet steam tunnels and laboratories. These floating weirds (hybrid elementals originally invented by [Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niv-Mizzet%2C+the+Firemind)) emerge out of nowhere as animated thunderclouds—a sight the weather forecasters would be hard-pressed to predict.

Hearing thunder doesn’t necessarily mean Izzet shenanigans, however—it could also mean horsefeathers. Long banished from their wildnerness homes, the herd of wild pegasus depicted in **[Storm Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Herd)** now roams Ravnica forever, searching for sky untainted by civilization. They won’t find that, but when they show up, a Ravnican citizen might close up his shop at the first drop of pegasus feathers.

![Culling Sun](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1001_cullingsun.jpg)Ravnica’s weather isn’t even necessarily pleasant when it’s *sunny*. Make sure you have on your SPF-45 when the midday sun rises on an Orzhov holiday: **[Culling Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Culling+Sun)**. In their religion, the meek shall certainly not inherit *anything*. 

With all that terrible weather, it’s unsurprising that the plane is covered in buildings. Who in their right mind ([Skarrgan Skybreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Skarrgan%2BSkybreaker) don’t count) would want to be caught *outside?*
