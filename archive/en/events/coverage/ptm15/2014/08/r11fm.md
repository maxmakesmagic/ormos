*Magic* is a game with both an always-new feature and a little history that comes with it. Players all over the world learn what's new together, and continually explore the every-growing game. Some have been doing that for longer than you might think.




**The Players**




 Richard – better known by Neil – Reeves was once considered one of the best Limited players in the world. Jumping to the world's attention with two Pro Tour Top 8 finishes in 2002, Reeves fell into the background thereafter. With his solid performance this weekend, after winning his way back to the Pro Tour through a Pro Tour Qualifier this year, it was on him to find a way into the Top 25 for an invite to the next.




 Across from him sat another longtime player that had just qualified again through a PTQ: Neil Rigby. While his record isn't as flashy as Reeves's, Rigby was similarly carrying well over a decade of *Magic* experience. Fighting his way to at least Top 25 would ensure he'd have another chance to prove he still compete with the best.






*Both Neil Reeves and Neil Rigby have a long history with *Magic*, as the battle of the Neils quickly got underway.*
