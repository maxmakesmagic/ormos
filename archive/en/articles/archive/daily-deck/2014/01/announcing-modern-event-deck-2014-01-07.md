**Your power is here. Your time is now.**

*Get started with the deep-strategy Modern format in style! Draw on rare, high-powered **Magic** cards from past sets with this tightly constructed 60-card deck. Also includes a 15-card sideboard, strategy guide, Spindown life counter, 80 exclusive card sleeves, 5 double-sided tokens, and a deck box.* 

We are excited to introduce a new deck product to support the Modern format. This is meant to be in-line with the Event Decks we have released for specific sets except this is not set-specific and is for Modern rather than for Standard.
