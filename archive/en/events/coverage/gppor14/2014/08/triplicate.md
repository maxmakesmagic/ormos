 Grand Prix Portland marks the start of a new Premier Play season, and it does so with a bang. *Magic*'s first four-day Grand Prix is also one of just four Team Limited events in the next 12 months, and coming a week after Pro Tour *Magic 2015* and in the same city it has attracted some of the game's biggest names to the unique challenge of sharing a sealed pool with two other people.



Here's how it works: each team is made up of three players who are designated "A," "B" or "C," which determine the order players sit at the table when competing. The team then receives 12 booster packs from which they build three decks each with their own distinct sideboard. Teams are then matched up against opposing teams and the side that takes two of the three matches wins the round.


Simple enough to understand, right? As you might expect, the devil is in the details. With so many packs it's easy to make one extremely powerful deck. Sometimes you can even make two, if the good cards are spaced out between colors. But the goal is to make the three best possible decks to maximize your chances of winning the round, and that's when things get tricky. It's a format that leaves a lot of choices and room for error, and one that few teams have mastered.


One group who has come close is the super-team of Dave Williams, Matt Sperling and 2014 Hall of Fame class member Paul Rietzl. The trio won a Team Limited event at Grand Prix San Jose in 2012, and they're hoping to add another title here in Portland.





*Sperling looks over Williams' shoulder as he considers his next play.*
