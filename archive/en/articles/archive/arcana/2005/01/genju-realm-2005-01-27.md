![Genju of the Realm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Genju+of+the+Realm)The *Betrayers* 
[Genju](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=genju&fields=%7Cname&format=BetrayersofKamigawa&color=All&output=summary&sort=name&first=1) are a cycle-plus-one of Enchant Lands that represent the spirits of the lands. You can read Paul Sottosanti's history of their development [here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/af49). 

  
  
[Genju of the Realm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genju+of+the+Realm), the five-color "plus-one" of the cycle, represents the spirit of the entire Kamigawa world coming to life. Its art showcases this abstractly by showing an enormous kami with aspects of plains, islands, swamps, mountains and forests. Check it out below.

The kami has plains spread across his right elbow, a boggy swamp on his left, mountains on his shoulders, a forest glade growing out of his head and a waterfall (representative of the Great Waterfall pictured on [Island1](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Island1)) flowing out of his mouth.

(The floating masks near him are the [energy objects](/en/articles/archive/kami-energy-objects-2004-09-07) that indicate his kami nature.)

[Genju of the Realm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genju+of+the+Realm) is the only one of the genju that doesn't have to enchant a particular land type. It's also the only legendary one. It's *also* the first multicolor "gold" card printed in **Magic**'s new card frame. So be sure to point out those factoids to your opponent, as you beat him down with an 8/12 trampling [Crosis's Catacombs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crosis%27s+Catacombs) during a game of [Prismatic](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=prismatic)!
