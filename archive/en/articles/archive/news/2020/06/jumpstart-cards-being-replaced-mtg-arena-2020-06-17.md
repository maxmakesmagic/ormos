Twenty cards from the upcoming release of *Jumpstart* will be a bit different for the set when it releases on *Magic: The Gathering Arena*. These cards will be replaced with other cards, some of which will also be new to *MTG Arena*! We'll share the details of what cards are going to replace them, as well as more on playing *Jumpstart* digitally, with the July State of the Game. In the meantime, we'll update this page with cards from the paper version that will not be appearing digitally.
