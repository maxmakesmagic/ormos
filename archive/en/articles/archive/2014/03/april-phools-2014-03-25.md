Beginning Monday, March 31, at 12:30 PM PDT and continuing until downtime on April 2, we're planning eight—count 'em: 8!—eight-booster Phantom Sealed formats to play. These are not your everyday formats, either:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| * Heavy Metal
* The Erik Lauer Experience
* The *Weatherlight* Saga
* Cycling Time!
 | * Core Crazy!
* Tribes
* Sliver Farm
* Woooo Berg!
 |

I bet you're asking yourself questions like, "Pray, what constitutes an Erik Lauer Experience?" To which I would enthusiastically reply, "Ahh! Such delights await you in the Erik Lauer Experience! You can experience this Experience—and more—for just 10 Event Tickets, or 16 Phantom Points!"


Then you might say something like, "Dude, you're weird," and I would just nod in the affirmative. But therein dwells the fun—nay! The PHUN!—behind April Phool's: Join an event to discover which of those special 8-booster April Phool's Phantom Sealed formats you'll be playing, and then what booster packs make up that format!


SQUUEEEEE!
