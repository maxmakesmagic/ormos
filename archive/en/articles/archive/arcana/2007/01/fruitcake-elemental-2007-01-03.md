Happy New Year! You may have seen a foily holiday surprise mentioned in the coverage of [The Finish Line](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/thefinishline), Wizards of the Coast’s holiday party to celebrate the winner of the Great Designer Search (congratulations to Alexis Janson).


That foily surprise was Fruitcake Elemental, a special gift to all the Finish Line attendees and to Wizards’ internal teams and business partners. Check it out:




Illustrated by Darrell Riche and designed by a hand-selected committee of R&D elves, Fruitcake Elemental is one of the rarer promotional cards in recent memory and an indestructible acknowledgement of the importance of regifting.
