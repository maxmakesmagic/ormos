The Community Cup is here! This weekend, September 19–20, a [team of awesome community members, content creators, and *Magic* aficionados](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/2015-community-cup-2015-08-12) will descend on Wizards of the Coast headquarters to do battle with the infamous Wizards Team! In this annual showdown, the Community Team is battling not just for fame and bragging rights—[they're battling for sweet prizes for all MTGO players](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-announcements-september-8-2015-2015-09-08#item5)!


But what kinds of events will they be playing, you wonder? Well, hypothetical reader, I'm glad you hypothetically asked!


MTGO *Legacy Cube* Stipulation Draft
====================================


*(Editor's Note: This was originally published with* Battle For Zendikar *as the Stipulation Draft format. That was incorrect.)*


The first arena of battle is the *Legacy Cube*Stipulation Draft! That's right: The Community Team will be drafting *Legacy Cube* a week before Prerelease—but it's no ordinary draft. Stipulation Draft places all sorts of wacky rules and restrictions on the players. Examples from past years include everything from having to draft the "least threatening" cards in any pack, to cards with the names that are most like "arcade game names," to drafting a deck with NO creatures! What challenges will be cooked up for our teams to deal with this year? You'll have to tune in to see!


*Battle for Zendikar* Paper Sealed
==================================


The Community Cup then continues with a good old-fashioned *BFZ* paper Sealed. And by "old-fashioned," we mean brand spanking new—the Community Team will be the first to play the set in paper, all as part of the *BFZ* launch!


MTGO Ironroot Chef
==================

The Ironroot Chef event is a long-standing tradition and fan favorite. Each team will be given an assortment of ingredients to include in their deckbuilding. The teams will then battle each other with their Ironroot decks, winning points as they accumulate victories. However, they will also earn points at the end based on how flavorfully they embraced and utilized their secret surprise ingredients. Check out how the teams balance flavor and power as they cook up some spicy homebrews!


MTGO *Battle for Zendikar* Draft
================================


Finally, the event will close out with one more *Battle for Zendikar* draft on MTGO. No stipulations, no shenanigans. (Unless you count Worth Wollpert viciously hate-drafting as "shenanigans.")


After the four events, the points will be tallied and the victor determined! Will the community triumph? Or will the Wizards Team finally buck their losing streak and take home the bacon?


The Community Cup stream will start at 10 a.m. PST both days. [Tune in to watch!](http://www.twitch.tv/magic)
