What’s wrong with this picture?

  
*Twinstrike art by Christopher Rush*Twinstrike depicts an Azorius mage and her soldier escort getting skewered by the bladelike arc of a Rakdos spell. The form of the figures looked great in the sketch, but when Chris Rush went with a green cast to the magic of the spell, it was clear there needed to be a color touch-up for the final art of the card.

![Twinstrike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Twinstrike)In the production step, the green magic was changed to fiery red magic with digital art techniques, and the card’s “Rakdosification” was complete.

Other cards have undergone color switches like this in the past; check out [Goblin Charbelcher](/en/articles/archive/sketches-goblin-charbelcher-2003-12-08) or [Granulate](/en/articles/archive/greenulate-2004-05-25) from back in the *Mirrodin* block.
