Downtime: December 1, 7–11 a.m. PT
==================================


There is a downtime this morning, December 1, scheduled from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. PT (15:00–19:00 UTC).


Release Redeployment
====================


On Monday, we redeployed the release that was reverted on Friday, November 19. This also included fixes for issues that occurred after that initial deployment. Unfortunately, another issue occurred that impacted Wedding Crashers, *Jump In!*, and Midweek *Magic*, requiring us to disable these events. That issue will be resolved during the December 1 downtime, after which all three events will be turned back on. Players who joined the events during the affected period will be automatically reimbursed.


Arena Open Draft This Weekend
=============================


Arena Open returns this weekend, December 4–5, featuring both Best-of-One and Traditional Best-of-Three Draft matches on Day 1 (Saturday, December 4). Earn an invitation token during Day 1 to enter Day 2's high-stakes Traditional (Best-of-Three) Player Draft (December 5).
