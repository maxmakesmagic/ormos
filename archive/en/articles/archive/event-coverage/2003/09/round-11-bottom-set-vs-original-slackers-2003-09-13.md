Last year, Maher and Reeves made Top 4 with Gary Wise. This year, they're one match away from repeating, this time with good friend Dave Williams. On the other side of the spectrum, Original Slackers is a team from Norway without any major Pro Tour accomplishments, although they have been around competitive **Magic** for a while and Osterberg has three GP Top 8s with one win. A win here would put all three players on the map.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptbos03/a818.jpg)Maher's creatures were held back by Crnobori's Beast team, which included [Needleshot Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needleshot+Gourna). [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf) was out and active as well, making life difficult as always. Maher did have the [Wall of Deceit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Deceit) - [Aphetto Runecaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Runecaster) combo going, but needed to find an answer to the Timberwatch. Eventually he had to start chump blocking, until he unmorphed [Titanic Bulvox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Bulvox) on end step, untapped, and summoned [Spitting Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Gourna), *and* put [Alpha Status](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Status) on his Bulvox to make it a deadly trampling machine. Crnobori was able to absorb the attack and take down the Bulvox, then summoned [Dragon Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mage) to push through the rest. 

Reeves won the first game easily by putting on quick pressure and gaining tempo advantage. This involved playing a 4/4 [Embalmed Brawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embalmed+Brawler) and flipping over a [Zombie Cutthroat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Cutthroat) in response to [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). Game 2 was more of the same, as Reeves got out a solid Zombie team of [Skinthinner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinthinner), [Embalmed Brawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embalmed+Brawler) and [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk). Smith played a much bigger threat in [Anurid Murkdiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Murkdiver), and had [Carrion Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) as well. Still, Reeves had strength in numbers, and sent all of his creatures into the Red Zone to try to force through enough damage before Smith could stabilize. A hard-cast [Zombie Cutthroat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Cutthroat) provided some much-needed defense, and Smith blocked Reeves's attacks, which were able to force through a few more points of damage. [Rush of Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rush+of+Knowledge) let Smith draw six cards, and it seemed he had the edge. However, Reeves attacked with his team, brought Smith down to one, and finished him off with [Spark Spray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spark+Spray).

In the other match, Osterberg's [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) would have been trouble, if not for Williams's [Daru Sanctifier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Sanctifier). Still, Osterberg gained the advantage in the air with [Swooping Talon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swooping+Talon) and an [Aven Farseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Farseer) that became 3/3. [Dragon Scales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Scales) enchanted the Talon and made it a removal machine, taking down Williams's creatures one at a time until he conceded.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptbos03/a819.jpg)In game 2, Williams could only muster a 2/2 [Daru Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Stinger), but he had a Warchief to make it a little more threatening. Not helping matters was the fact that Osterberg drew his [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift), although while the Warchief was out, Williams's creatures would at least be a little harder to kill. It wouldn't take much to handle the problem, as Osterberg put his [Catapult Squad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catapult+Squad) in front of the Stinger and used [Pinpoint Avalanche](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pinpoint+Avalanche) to destroy the [Daru Warchief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Warchief). He improved his position a little more with [Gempalm Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Avenger), but Williams handled the threat with [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism). Osterberg couldn't get the threats he needed, although he did draw plenty of land to power his [Flamewave Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamewave+Invoker). Over the course of the next turns, Williams played a second [Whipgrass Entangler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipgrass+Entangler) along with [Ascending Aven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascending+Aven) and [Zombie Cutthroat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Cutthroat), while Osterberg got to eight lands. Williams went for an all out attack to bring Osterberg to 1 life point, but there was an out left. Osterberg played [Decree of Annihilation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Annihilation) to reset the game, leaving him with a [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift). Both players rebuilt, with Williams playing a morph, and Osterberg having the right answer in [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) to stay alive. Williams had a [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism), however, played it, and forced through the last points of damage to win the game.

A pair of [Scattershot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scattershot)s helped Crnobori deal with some of Maher's creatures, leaving Bob with only a [Needleshot Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needleshot+Gourna) to a [Goblin Sledder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder) and morph creature. Still, Maher was able to force through significant damage before that point, bringing Crnobori down to seven life points. Crnobori had only a [Wirewood Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Elf) and a morph, which was taken care of thanks to [Frozen Solid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frozen+Solid). The Gourna attacked twice more to bring Crnobori down to one, and on the next attack Crnobori blocked with two Wirewood Elves and a morph, then used [Carbonize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carbonize) to take the 3/6 down. He started to stabilize with a Needleshot of his own, but Maher had [Threaten](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten) to take it and get through the last points of damage.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptbos03/a820.jpg)Crnobori mulliganed down to five, and Maher went to six. Maher summoned a morph, and Crnobori missed his fourth land drop, but kept pace thanks to [Wirewood Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Elf). [Battering Craghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battering+Craghorn), [Skirk Outrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Outrider) and [Needleshot Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needleshot+Gourna) kept the pressure on, while Maher's draw offered little resistance. [Accelerated Mutation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accelerated+Mutation) finished him off, leaving the Top 4 berth to be decided between Williams and Osterberg.

Williams started off with [Whipgrass Entangler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipgrass+Entangler), and Osterberg had [Deftblade Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deftblade+Elite) and [Catapult Squad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catapult+Squad). [Akroma's Devoted](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Devoted) made Williams' defense look better, but Osterberg put [Dragon Scales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Scales) on his Elite to not only give him a 2/3 provoke creature, but the ability to activate the [Catapult Squad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catapult+Squad) on an attack as well. With the help of [Piety Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piety+Charm) the Devoted was taken out, and Williams seemed to be in trouble. [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) followed, and [Whipgrass Entangler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipgrass+Entangler) was the next to die. Warped Researched slowed things down, however, and Williams played a 3/3 Stinger. Just when it seemed that Williams was back in the game, Osterberg brought out [Dawn Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Elemental). Williams summoned a [Dragonstalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstalker), giving him a flying threat to crack back with. He kept playing threats, which left Osterberg lacking options and with time running out. He had to go for the win soon and cast [Decree of Annihilation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Annihilation). He was prepared and came out strong with [Aven Farseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Farseer) and [Flamewave Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamewave+Invoker), but Williams was ready to put up a fight with [Starlight Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starlight+Invoker) and [Zealous Inquisitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zealous+Inquisitor). With Williams tapped out, Osterberg cycled [Eternal Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Dragon) to Rift away the Inquisitor, and then summoned [Aven Soulgazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Soulgazer) to make his flying clock 4 damage a turn. With the help of [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift), this was enough to defeat Williams and send Original Slackers to the Top 4.

**Final Result:** Original Slackers defeats Bottom Set 2-1
