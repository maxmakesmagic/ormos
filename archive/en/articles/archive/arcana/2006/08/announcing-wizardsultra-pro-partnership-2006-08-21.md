Right now, millions of microbial breakdancers are moonwalking their way between your fingertips and that trackball of yours. The trackball doesn’t mind, but what about your [Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool)s and draft rares? Frankly, they’re a little grossed out.

Your Magic cards called. They asked us to help get you some good card sleeves to protect their valuable little faces.

Wouldn’t it be nice if there were some way that Wizards could get together with some awesome sleeve company to make some high-quality, durable **Magic** sleeves?

(NYSE: HAS) and Ultra Pro, the leading manufacturer and marketer of innovative archival safe-storage products in North America, today announced their strategic partnership. Together, they will produce Magic: The Gathering-branded card and game play accessories for players of the world’s first and premier trading card game (TCG). The partnership will include the production of exclusive card sleeves, deck boxes, collector binders and much more including the first Magic: The Gathering-branded exclusive card sleeves suitable for Magic: The Gathering tournament play. These new card and game play accessories are slated to arrive in-stores worldwide later this year. |

| “Magic: The Gathering established the TCG category with its launch in 1993 and we continue to be the pioneer in this industry,” said Elaine Chase, Senior Brand Manager for Magic: The Gathering at Wizards of the Coast. “We’re committed to providing our players with the most complete and comprehensive lifestyle experience possible and entering into this partnership with Ultra Pro was simply a logical choice for us to continue that effort for our millions of loyal fans.” 
Until this partnership, players of Magic: The Gathering had a variety of choices in card and game play accessories, none of which had a specific connection to the game itself above and beyond functionality. Ultra Pro’s expertise and manufacturing coupled with Wizards of the Coast’s vast creativity will allow these same players to house, store and transport their cards and game play accessories in a more meaningful and branded way.
“When we first sat down with Wizards of the Coast to discuss creating Magic: The Gathering card and game play accessories, it quickly became apparent this would be both a logical and productive partnership,” said Mary Sarandon, Senior Vice President with Ultra Pro. “Wizards of the Coast’s long-standing reputation as the leader in the TCG category combined with their on-going commitment to providing their players the best possible game experience made this an easy decision for both companies.”
