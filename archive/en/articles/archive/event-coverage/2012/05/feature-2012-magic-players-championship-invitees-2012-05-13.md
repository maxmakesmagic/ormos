 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 






 With the conclusion of Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored*, the final spots for the Players Championship, taking place in Seattle during the last week of August, have been decided. Six slots had been decided before this event began, leaving ten slots left to be divided up. Here are the sixteen players invited to the Players Championship, the best of the best. 


First are the invites for the winners of various awards during the previous season:


 2011 Player of the Year Owen Turtenwald  
 2011 World Champion Jun'ya Iyanaga  
 2011 **Magic Online** Champion Reid Duke  
 Pro Tour Philadelphia Champion Samuele Esratti  
 Pro Tour *Dark Ascension* Champion Brian Kibler  
 Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* Champion Alexander Hayne 


Next come the players with the highest number of Pro Points from each of the geographic regions:


 Top North American Player: Josh Utter-Leyton  
 Top Latin American Player: Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa  
 Top European Player: Martin Juza  
 Top Japanese Player: Yuuya Watanabe  
 Top Asia-Pacific Player: Tzu Ching Kuo 


Finally, the remaining five slots go to the five players with the highest number of Pro Points that didn't win an invitation through other means:


 At-Large Bid: Jon Finkel  
 At-Large Bid: Luis Scott-Vargas  
 At-Large Bid: Shouta Yasooka  
 At-Large Bid: David Ochoa

 This incredible collection of players will be competing in late August for over $100,000 in one of the toughest competitions they will have faced, fought over three days and three formats. The event is truly skill testing and the culmination of a year of excellent play. Only the best get to play, and only the best of the best can win.
