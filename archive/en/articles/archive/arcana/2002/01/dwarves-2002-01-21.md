If you've been paying attention, you should have noticed that dwarves have replaced goblins as the red race of choice in the *Odyssey* block, evident in cards like [Dwarven Strike Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Strike+Force) and [Whipkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipkeeper).
