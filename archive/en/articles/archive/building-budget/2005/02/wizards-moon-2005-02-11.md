![Coastal Wizard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Coastal+Wizard)As many of you know, many of the **magicthegathering.com** writers do not work at Wizards of the Coast. This has been the case for me as well, until now. That's right…Building on a Budget is now coming to you live from Wizards of the Coast in Washington. I recently accepted the general gaming R&D internship position, which means I get to run around testing all sorts of games, helping to improve on them before release. What does this mean for you? Why, better Building on a Budget, of course! Now, while Mark Rosewater is off fighting Ninjas and Aaron is fighting the good fight, I can bring you a little more of the flavor of what actually goes on here from time to time (like that time when Turian fought Place in the dojo for a cookie).At any rate, to stay on theme with my arrival at Wizards, I decided to make a Wizard-based budget deck for today. Now, in the past this deck would have been composed of slim pickings…but luckily, since the printing of [Patron Wizard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+Wizard), the tribe has been steadily getting better bit by bit. The latest incarnation of this tribe is the Soratami Moonfolk.

There is one Wizard in particular that I have been very impressed with: [Azami, Lady of Scrolls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azami%2C+Lady+of+Scrolls). This wizard can allow you to draw a lot of cards and get ahead in the game from the very first turn it comes into play. The reason for this is the way the ability is worded: summoning sickness won't stop you from using it right away, meaning that you will at least get X cards for your troubles, where X is the number of untapped Wizards you have at the time.

Other great Wizards are [Puppeteer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppeteer), [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage), [Daring Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daring+Apprentice), and the all-powerful [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror). That, combined with the small amount of reasonable countermagic that has crept back into Standard in the form of [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and [Hinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinder), makes for a pretty spicy looking Wizard deck. Let's take a look at it close up:

This deck plays out by controlling threatening attackers with [Puppeteer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppeteer) and various artifacts fetched by [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) ([Steel Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Wall), [Viridian Longbow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow), [Leonin Bola](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Bola), [Aether Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb)). It compliments these with countermagic so things don't get out of hand. Then it starts to move to the endgame plan. This could be one of the following:

1. Draw lots of cards via Azami and overwhelm your opponent.
2. Fly overhead with [Soratami Savant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soratami+Savant) and [Soratami Rainshaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soratami+Rainshaper)
3. Play Meloku. Win the game.

Out of those options, #1 and #3 are the strongest, but with lots of control elements in the deck #2 can work from time to time as well. Note that the Savant and the Rainshaper have built-in protection abilities, so it really helps them go the distance. Depending on your situation, sometimes [Leonin Bola](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Bola) can help you force some extra damage through on the ground, but don't expect it to be easy.

### Tips on Playing the Deck

![Aether Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aether+Spellbomb)* Having trouble with a creature? [Aether Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb) it back to your opponents' hand and counter it on the way back down for some tried and true Blue methodology!
* Be careful about returning too many lands to your hand via the Soratami…you really want to build up a strong mana base for when you play Meloku.
* Don't play Meloku out early, as you need to be able to protect her, or at least make a bunch of guys if she's going to die right away.
* Passing the [Viridian Longbow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) around is your only way to actually kill creatures. If you don't know how to do this, see below.

Passing the Longbow: First, start with an equipped creature. Tap that creature to shoot something. Then, equip the longbow to a different untapped creature that doesn't have summoning sickness. Now that creature can also shoot something. This translates into 3 mana = +1 damage for pinging. This will allow you to take down 2/2 creatures (or sometimes bigger) very easily.

### Adding Money to the Deck

[Vedalken Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles) is likely the best thing to add to the deck. Be warned; they are getting pricy now that everyone is recognizing their power level. [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) will help add more kill cards to the deck. Also, more Melokus would really help the cause. If you want to take a slightly different route, you could add green for [Azusa, Lost but Seeking](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azusa%2C+Lost+but+Seeking) with Birds and other mana-goodies in order to make the Moonfolk better. Once *Betrayers* is legal online, however, I would just go with the Patron of the Soratami, since the ability is rather similar and it is an awesome finisher that can be cast instantaneously. I would also consider adding [Ninja of the Deep Hours](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours) from *Betrayers*, just because I have found it to be the best Blue creature since [Thieving Magpie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Magpie), and with the fliers it isn't too hard to Ninjustu out there.

Overall, this deck is decent and has a lot of room for personal preference changes, since the Wizard fodder could easily be replaced with other equally cool and useful Wizards, as long as they can deal with a weenie strategy. It is great for a player who wants to explore blue a little more as a color option, or even to just understand strategies that can beat it.
