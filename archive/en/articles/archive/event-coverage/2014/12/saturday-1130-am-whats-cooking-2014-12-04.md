Most of the players are off for a quick lunch and Beijing is certainly not lacking in local delicacies. Here are some of the good eats I have had to experience during the course of this weekend.

Perhaps the most famous dish of Beijing is the ubiquitous Peking Duck. Prepared since the Imperial Era for the rich and famous, it is now considered to be one of China's national food. Roasted to crispy perfection, it is a treat not to be missed while in China.

Another popular dish among the locals and foreigners alike, the Gung Bao Chicken is a dish prepared by wok-frying diced chicken with an assortment of cashew nuts and greens and topped off with sweet and spicy gravy. Absolutely divine!

You cannot miss the steamboat restaurants when you traverse the streets of China. It is almost customary that reunions and gatherings should be enjoyed over a steaming pot of soup and assorted sliced meats, accompanied with unique in-house peanut sauces and garnish. Being somewhat silly, I actually ordered enough to feed a small family and all for less than US$15.
