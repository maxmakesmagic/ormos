 When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he dreamt of a job making Magic cards—and now as a Magic designer, he's living his dream! Gavin has been writing about Magic since 2005. 





*Fate.*

It has been described as many things. Fixed. Fickle. Fatal. As both a blessing and a curse of the human nature. And, most commonly, unchangeable. 

Well, I like to think about it a little differently.

 There are things in life that happen to you that you can't completely control—that is certainly true. You can't really control how traffic is going to be, or what the weather is going to end up as. But what you *can*control is how you react and plan. If traffic is awful, you can audible and take another route. If it's raining, you could dress appropriately—or you could have checked the weather report the night before and prepared for it. 

It works the other way, too.

Maybe you met your significant other by total coincidence at a party—but it was you who chose to go that party in the first place instead of staying at home that day. And maybe, just maybe, you topdecked the right card to win a PTQ... but remember: you made all of the plays to get into the finals so you could put yourself into a situation where you would be able to topdeck that card. In another universe, maybe you never got that far.

 It's all action and reaction. You don't just have to let life happen to you—you can let *yourself* happen to life.

But enough existentialism. Where is all of this philosophy going? Well, it ties in with this week's ReConstructed article, of course! For Fated Week, I'm going to choose the deck I work on completely randomly out of all the decks submitted to me this week. This is the fate part. This is life throwing me something.

Then, I'm going to react to what I'm thrown. I'm going to get tossed a deck and make it the best I can while keeping it the same colors it started as.

Action. Reaction. Deck building. Ready?
