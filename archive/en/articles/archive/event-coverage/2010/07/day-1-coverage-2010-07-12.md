* **Saturday, June 12: 10:13a.m. – Grand Prix Trial Decklists**
*by Ray "blisterguy" Walkinshaw*

Nobody can deny that there is an element of luck in **Magic**, and while most can appreciate that the best players know how to minimize the potential for upsets, there's always an outside chance it could all go horribly wrong. That's why even the best players will battle through a Grand Prix Trial to try to earn three byes in the big event, because there's only thing that's a sure thing, and that's a guaranteed win. Six Grand Prix Trials were run here yesterday, and for once, none of the spots were taken by Jund! Here are the winning decks.

* **Feature Match Round 4: James Porter vs Hao-Shan Huang** 
*by Ray "blisterguy" Walkinshaw*

While it may feel like a life time ago for James Porter, it was only four years ago he emerged from this very tournament holding high the trophy. For Hao-Shan Huang, his victory was more recent, winning the fourth Grand Prix Trial yesterday.


Huang got off to a fast start with his Next Level Bant deck, powering out a quick [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine), but Porter, playing the same deck, had an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) to keep him honest. Both players then moved on to their back-up plan, trading blows with [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade)s, until Porter tutored up a [Scute Mob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scute+Mob) with his [Ranger of Eos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos). Huang requested assistance from [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), digging for either an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) or a [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) to deal with the Mob. Instead, he rounded out his turn with an Elspeth, making a Soldier Token to hold off the Insect. Porter sent his Colonnade to kill Jace, and his [Scute Mob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scute+Mob) at Elspeth, Huang sacrificed a [Wall of Omens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens) to protect the White Planeswalker, but had to bid adieu to the Blue one. Eying up Porters measly five life, Huang dropped an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) on Porter's remaining untapped creature - a [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) - and sent his Solider token to the air with Elspeth. Porter swatted it aside with [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), only to lose his [Scute Mob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scute+Mob) to a [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) from Huang. Porter doubled down the Elspeth with one of his own, but couldn't stop the Gideon from trundling across to take game one.


Huang 1 – Porter 0


 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpman10/fm4huang.jpg)
 

Game two started out on a much better note for Porter, summoning a turn three [Master of the Wild Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt) in the face of Huang's mulligan. Huang wasted no time throwing it through an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), but Porter merely summoned another. Jace came down for Huang, and bounced the second Master, a [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) throwing itself in front of Porter's 1/1 [Scute Mob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scute+Mob) to protect [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). Jace dropped to one loyalty to bounce the Master a second time, while Elspeth joined the team. With the help of a [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch), Porter again sent the Mob in to tousle with Jace, Huang this time throwing a soldier in front, while Porter yet again summoned his Master. Huang wound his Jace back up to three, while digging for an answer to Porter's men with a [Sea Gate Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle). Porter went for an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), but Huang [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)d it, chump-blocking the incoming Master with yet another Soldier. Huang found a [Journey to Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) to send away the [Master of the Wild Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt), and started drawing cards with his Jace. Porter was still looking for the fifth land he needed to start businessing his [Scute Mob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scute+Mob). Huang summoned a [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine), but Porter had a [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) for that, and a second one to clear the way for his Wolf to kill Jace, before removing Elspeth with an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring). Huang attacked back with a [Stirring Wildwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood), while Porter summoned a Sphinx of the Lost Truths, ditching a [Ranger of Eos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos), another Sphinx and a [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine), keeping and playing a crucial fifth land. Huang had nothing, and the [Scute Mob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scute+Mob) came over and ate the Oracle. Porter followed up with another [Master of the Wild Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt). Huang tried to attack back in the air with his [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade), but was swiftly out-gunned by Porter's [Scute Mob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scute+Mob).


Huang 1 – Porter 1


 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpman10/fm4porter.jpg)
 

Huang agonized over his hand in game three, eventually electing to keep it and lead with a pair of [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade)s. Neither player played anything but lands, until Huang broke the peace with a [Linvala, Keeper of Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+Keeper+of+Silence) on turn four. Porter replied by summoning a [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine) and serving it for four. Huang had an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) for it, and a [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) to swing back equally. [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) came down for Porter, promptly killing Linvala, and Huang finished it off with one of his Colonnades. Porter rallied with a [Sphinx of Jwar Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Jwar+Isle). Thanks to his Hierarch and a freshly summoned [Qasali Pridemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage), Huang was able to attack into the Sphinx with his Colonnade, dropping Porter to 13. The Sphinx attacked back, and Huang played a [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura). Porter recruited Jace to bounce the Pridemage, before using an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) of his own to get back his [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine). He sent them both at Gideon. Huang threw his Hierarch in front of the [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine), then attacked Porter down to four with Gideon and a Colonnade. Porter bounced Huang's remaining blocker and sent his team in for exactly enough damage. Huang thought he was on one more life, but as they tallied up the life totals, it turned out Huang had failed to note the cost of one of his [Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest).

* **Feature Match: Round 6 – Cheyenne Batnag vs Shouta Yasooka**
*by Ray "blisterguy" Walkinshaw*

Bear with me on this one. You probably know who Shouta Yasooka is, but Cheyenne Batnag may require a little more explanation. Before this round, I was up at the stage, typing away, surrounded by pro players swapping war stories, when Mat Marr came up and loudly proclaimed he'd seen the coolest deck ever. "This guy is 5-0 with no byes, and his name is like, Cheyenne Bant or something, and he's playing the coolest Black/Red deck! You should totally do a decktech with him." We found his name in the pairings for the round, and verified he wasn't actually named after the antithesis of his deck, and noted his name down as someone to look out for in the pairings for this round, should he get paired with a known player. You know, like Yasooka.


Yasooka won the roll, and kicked things off with a turn three [Sprouting Thrinax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax), but not before cocking an eyebrow at Batnag's turn one [Veinfire Borderpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veinfire+Borderpost). [Gatekeeper of Malakir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir) converted the Thrinax into Saprolings, but Yasooka [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)ed the Gatekeeper, and summoned another Thrinax. Batnag [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate)d an incoming [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine), but a [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) cascading into [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning) had him well and truly on the back foot. Another [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) couldn't save him from the growing horde of 1/1s, and he was quickly reaching for his sideboard.


Yasooka 1 – Batnag 0





|  |

| 
*Yasooka Duresses Batnag.* |


A [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) from Yasooka denied Batnag a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), while Batnag summoned a [Vampire Hexmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage). Yasooka had another Thrinax, and after Summoning a [Putrid Leech](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech), discarded a pair of excess lands to a [Bloodhusk Ritualist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodhusk+Ritualist) from Batnag. Batnag continued the rogue hits with a [Lord of Shatterskull Pass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Shatterskull+Pass), but it died to a [Maelstrom Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) after Yasooka [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed away an [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake). Yasooka attacked with his Thrinax and Leech, but then found himself faced with a second [Vampire Hexmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage), and a [Tuktuk the Explorer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tuktuk+the+Explorer). Seeing Yasooka had halted his attack, Batnag upgraded his Tuktuk by running it headfirst into the Thrinax, before summoning a second [Lord of Shatterskull Pass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Shatterskull+Pass). Yasooka summoned a [Siege-Gang Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander), but didn't have anything to stop the Lord leveling up to a 6/6. Batnag then attacked with it. Yasooka pumped his Leech before blockers to bait out any removal spells, and when the coast appeared clear, offered up either the Leech or his Thrinax for the Lord, while a Goblin token blocked the 5/5 Goblin Golem token. Yasooka again attacked with his Thrinax, the Siege-Gang preventing any favorable blocks for Batnag. Another [Maelstrom Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) took out the Goblin Golem while Batnag lost the rest of his hand to a [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning). The [Siege-Gang Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander) slowly mopped up the rest of Batnag's board, and Yasooka was soon attacking for the match.

* **Feature Match: Round 8 - Sam Black vs Ding Leong**
*by Ray "blisterguy" Walkinshaw*

"There's no way I'm winning this," Sam Black laughed as they shuffled their decks. "You can often tell the people who play red, because they always do." I ventured that maybe Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur 2010 Champion Ding Leong wasn't playing the Red deck he used to defeat three straight Jund decks in that top 8. "Well, we were also sitting a few tables away from each other earlier today too, so…"


"I probably shouldn't be doing this, but I'll keep him around," Black admitted, as he saved his [Putrid Leech](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech) from a [Searing Blaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze). Sure enough, on the following turn, a [Ball Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning) dropped him to single figures. Black summoned a [Sprouting Thrinax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax), but Leong already had enough burn to finish him, and they were on to game two in less time than they spent pre-match.


Ding Leong 1 – Crispy-fried Sam Black 0





|  |
| --- |
| 
*Leong and Black spent more time between games than in one.* |


Black started game two with a [Savage Lands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Lands), while Leong rushed in with a [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), revealing a [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Black fetched out a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) with a [Verdant Catacombs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs), falling to 17, and summoned a [Putrid Leech](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech). Leong again pointed a [Searing Blaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze) at the Leech, and again Black saved it, going to 12. Leong then offer to trade his guide for the Leech, and Black accepted, before summoning another one and playing a Lavaclaw reaches. The second Leech could only watch as a [Hell's Thunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Thunder) sailed over its head, dropping Black to 8. Black went fishing with his [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), seeing [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), [Goblin Ruinblaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Ruinblaster), [Lavaclaw Reaches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaclaw+Reaches) and [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), then [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning)'d away the Reaches and the Guide. Leong kicked the Ruinblaster, and Black traded his Leech for it, not wanting to pay any more life than he had to. He then untapped, played another land and summoned a [Sprouting Thrinax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax). Leong could only summon yet another [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) and pass the turn back without a fifth land. Black summoned [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), hitting [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning), and drawing out a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to drop him to 5. Black attacked with his Elf, which traded with the Guide. A second [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) found another [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning), luring a [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) out of Leong's hand and dropping Leong to 9. The [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) rebounded and put Black on 1. "Come ooon creature," Black joked, as either an untapped land or one of many spells would be the end of him, but Leong flipped over a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to finish the match.


Ding Leong incinerated Sam Black 2 – 0

* **Feature Match: Round 9 - Brian Kibler vs Shouta Yasooka**
*by Ray "blisterguy" Walkinshaw*

Both Brian Kibler and Shouta Yasooka have been on a bit of a tear lately, and are no strangers to the spotlight. Last week in Sendai they played each other at 8-0 to see who would go undefeated on day one, and then again in the semifinals. In both matches, Kibler emerged the victor, would Yasooka finally take his revenge?

*Kibler carefully manages his resources.* |


Yasooka won the roll, and played a pair of [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine)s to Kibler's [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and a [Sea Gate Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle). He then summoned a [Sprouting Thrinax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax), but Kibler sent it packing with his trusty [Bant Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm). Next up was [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), and the first two cards revealed were more Bloodbraid Elves, causing the audience to laugh appreciatively, eventually finding a [Putrid Leech](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech). Kibler cast Elspeth, and made a token solider. Yasooka woke up one of his Ravines and sent the team at Elspeth, but Kibler kept her alive with a [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) on the land, and his Oracle and Soldier tag-teaming the Bloodbraid. Kibler summoned a few more mana creatures, and made another soldier to hold off the Leech, before losing his hand (including a [Sphinx of Lost Truths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Lost+Truths) he would have been able to summon the next turn) and the Elspeth to a [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning). Yasooka summoned another Leech, and Kibler knocked on the top of his deck, calling for a replacement Sphinx. Instead he found a [Wall of Omens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens), which drew him into a Gideon, killing the tapped Leech. Yasooka animated his second Ravine and sent that alongside the Leech at Gideon. Kibler pushed a Birds and the Wall in front, but Yasooka had a [Maelstrom Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) anyway. Kibler again called for a Sphinx, "or a Colonnade, that'll do" the latter of which he found. The Colonnade flew in, and due to the incremental damage Kibler had been sneaking in throughout the game, Yasooka had a small window with which he could try and kill Kibler, but his many mana minions leapt valiantly in the way, and Kibler's [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) took game one.


Kibler 1 – Yasooka 0


"I drew Sphinx THAT turn, but then all I had to do was kill you," Kibler joked as they sideboarded. "Anything new for me since last week?" he asked, but Yasooka only replied with a smile.

*Yasooka checks the life totals.* |


Yasooka again started out with a Ravine, while this time Kibler had a [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch). Yasooka spent a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) on that, but had nothing on turn three, while Kibler smoothed out his mana with a [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger), or "land number 25" as he likes to call it. A [Goblin Ruinblaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Ruinblaster) set Kibler back, trading with both the Ranger and a Colonnade. Kibler continued to cantrip with a [Sea Gate Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) that took one for the team from the Ravine, and then a [Wall of Omens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens) into a [Scute Mob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scute+Mob). Another Ruinblaster kept the Mob away from meeting its potential, while Kibler summoned a [Ranger of Eos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos), collecting a pair of Hierarchs for his trouble. "I'm really glad I drew my [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger) this game," Kibler quipped as he barely managed to stay afloat. A fifth land for Kibler forced Yasooka to pull the trigger on a [Bituminous Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bituminous+Blast), dispatching the [Scute Mob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scute+Mob) before it could grow up to be a real boy. Kibler finally went on the offensive, sending in his [Ranger of Eos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos), with cheerleader support from the Hierarchs. He then kicked a [Sphinx of Lost Truths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Lost+Truths). Yasooka attacked back, trying to bury Kibler before his stream of cards overwhelmed him in turn, but it wasn't to be. A [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine) from Kibler had Yasooka playing defense, and a [Deprive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive) protected the Sphinx from a cascaded [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade). Yasooka looked for any way to get the rest of his damage through, but found nothing, and once again, the players finish day one as they did last week in Sendai.
