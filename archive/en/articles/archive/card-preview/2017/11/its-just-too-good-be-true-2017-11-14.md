Walking the dog. Drawing extra cards. Making the perfect chocolate mousse. Taking an extra turn. "Organizing" all the junk—I mean, important papers—on your desk. Reanimating creatures into 4/4 Zombies.


There are some tasks you just can't trust to someone else, things important enough that you have to take care of them yourself.


Now, with the release of *Unstable*, there's a handy creature for all the independently minded. For everyone who believes that to do a job well, you have to do it yourself. For all of those important do-it-yourself moments.


Now, there's Do-It-Yourself Seraph!


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ust/en_lU18pLgXLP.png)


That's right folks, it may look like a 4/4 flier (at the just-right price of six mana!), but what if I told you that, in addition to being an evasive threat, the Do-It-Yourself Seraph could single-handedly keep you from losing a game of *Magic* with one simple attack?


It may sound too good to believe, but with a copy of [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) in your deck, the Do-It-Yourself Seraph can get the job done.


Okay, okay, enough of the sales pitch, because I don't think I need to convince you of how awesome this card is. Instead, let's spend the rest of this article looking at some of the incredibly sweet possibilities that Do-It-Yourself Seraph unlocks.


To begin with, this card would love for us to draft around it. Picking this Angel up early means that we'll have the opportunity to draft artifacts to build our own artifact-Angel behemoth. Do-It-Yourself Seraph is also solid enough on its own that we'll want to play it in Draft even if we only have an artifact or two for its ability.


We don't know yet what kinds of neat text boxes Do-It-Yourself Seraph might be able to pick up in *Unstable* drafts, but we can certainly dream about the other places we might see this motivated and self-sufficient artifact impersonator. There might be a home for it in a neat cube, or perhaps your Commander group is open to using *Un*-set cards in your Commander decks. This means that the cards we might be searching out with its ability are countless. Okay, almost countless, since there are around 1,780 artifacts in *Magic*.


What's incredible about this card is that, to tell you about its full range of potential, I'd have to tell you about every single artifact in the history of *Magic*.


One of the things that I like most about Do-It-Yourself Seraph is that, because you'll already have cast a six-drop creature, a lot of the cheap mana artifacts that you want at the beginning of the game aren't going to be your first targets. [Sol Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring) is an incredible card, but it's less incredible once you're already attacking with a 4/4 flier, so there's a lot of room to get creative with the artifacts you're going to search up.


If you're looking for a place to start, why not start with whatever you love most about *Magic*? I love drawing cards, so of course my mind jumped to all the ways that I could use this creature to put some fresh spells in my hand. We might choose a simple [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) or [Font of Mythos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Font+of+Mythos) effect, letting our opponents get in on the fun.


But if we're doing all this work ourselves, we could also snag a [Staff of Nin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staff+of+Nin) or [Coercive Portal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coercive+Portal) instead and keep all the card-drawing fun for ourselves.

Or maybe you're more practical than me. You realize that, if this Angel is becoming more powerful with every attack, it's going to be a target for opponents' removal spells as soon as possible. In that case, perhaps it's best to copy any of the indestructible Darksteel artifacts like [Darksteel Ingot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) or [Darksteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus), or maybe [Darksteel Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Sentinel) if we also want the Seraph to pick up vigilance.


If we choose to pick up the text from [Stuffy Doll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy+Doll), then our opponent is really stuck when we—or they—enter combat. If they attack and we block, they'll take 4 from the Angel, and if we attack, they're faced with a choice between taking 4 from the unblocked Angel or taking however much damage their own blocker deals.


[Platinum Emperion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Emperion) and [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) are two more great targets, whose respective text boxes will help us close out a game while making sure we're not in any danger of losing. Sometimes, one 4/4 flier isn't enough to hold a board all on its own. If we were short on other ways to shore up the board when making our deck, we could always take the text from [Nevinyrral's Disk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nevinyrral%27s+Disk) and clear everything away when it gets out of hand.


Do-It-Yourself Seraph also seems like it would enjoy a solid multipurpose tool, like a Swiss army knife or one of those mixers that also makes pasta or ice cream, or maybe even a [Staff of Domination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staff+of+Domination).


Things, of course, will get really strange if we search out some of the artifacts that can make wild and weird combo wins possible, like [Aetherflux Reservoir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflux+Reservoir) or [Memory Jar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Jar).


This is only the smallest sample of what's possible with Do-It-Yourself Seraph. If you want to explore all of the myriad possibilities and find the best way to make this Angel work in your deck or cube, well, you're going to have to buckle down and do the work yourself.
