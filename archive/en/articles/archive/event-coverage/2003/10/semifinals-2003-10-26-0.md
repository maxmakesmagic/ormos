### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplyo03/a819.jpg)Jeroen started off rather quickly with a second turn [Iron Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr) and third turn [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica). The Grey Ogre was good enough to keep Yann's second turn [Slith Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Predator) at bay, but the Frenchman added a Tel-Jihad's Chosen to his forces. Jeroen played a [Fangren Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Hunter) on his fourth turn and it would be the first creature to actually attack in this game. The Dutchman cast another Myr and a [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) and Yann finished off the [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica) with an [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate) as he had two artifact lands out.

The Frenchman cast a [Woebearer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woebearer) one turn later but that too wouldn't stop Jeroen's [Fangren Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Hunter). Yann [Deconstruct](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deconstruct)ed the [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) and played a [Mirror Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Golem) with protection from artifacts and creatures. His [Slith Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Predator), Tel-Jihad's Chosen and [Woebearer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woebearer) proceeded to make their entry into the red zone, where the Predator traded with one of Jeroen's Myrs. The Dutchman's [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) finished off the [Mirror Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Golem) and he swung back for 5 damage, putting Yann at 7 life. 

Yann's [Woebearer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woebearer) returned his [Mirror Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Golem) back to his hand and he replayed it. [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) and [Dross Prowler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Prowler) made it into play next and Jeroen put an end to the threat of Yann's fear creatures by paying the full 7 mana for a [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer). That wouldn't stop the [Mirror Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Golem) though and it dropped Jeroen to 8 life. He didn't have a play on his turn, and Yann's all out attack was enough to finish the Dutchman off.

### Game 2

This time it was Yann who opened with a second turn Myr but Jeroen wouldn't have any of it and finished it off with an [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt). Yann wasn't too unhappy about that, as his [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) survived. He added a Tel-Jihad's Chosen to his side of the board as Jeroen was only playing lands, and no creatures. A [Battlegrowth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlegrowth) made sure Yann's Goblin was big enough to finish off 2/2's as well now.

[Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) fetched a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) as his fourth land. In the meanwhile Jeroen was just sitting there like a true goldfish for Yann – not even on turn seven did he play anything. [Woebearer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woebearer) joined forces and Yann looked at Jeroen with puzzlement. The Dutchman played his second spell on turn 8, a 7 mana [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) but it wasn't enough to stop Yann's creatures.

**Final Result:** Hamon 2 – Remie 0
