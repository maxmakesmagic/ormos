Grand Prix Santiago was well supported by the cosplay community. We had a chance to catch up with some of them to talk about their characters and their love of cosplay.

“I have been doing cosplay for four years. I taught myself photo editing with a friend, and then taught myself leatherworking, making custom costume for theatre. Then a friend told me about cosplay; I saw her pictures and I fell in love with the idea. So I started making my own costumes. I picked Liliana because I love strong women - I feel well represented by her. I also love graveyards!”

“I like impersonating, making the costumes, and hanging out with people. I was at an event and I liked the people doing cosplay, and wanted to do it myself. I taught myself how to make costumes. I chose Nissa because she’s a warrior, she’s bonded to nature, and I love the elvish traits that Nissa has.”

“I always wanted to cosplay; I like the geek world around Magic and the artistic feel of cosplaying. But I needed to find something that would match my physical appearance. I thought Jace was the perfect planeswalker to cosplay for me. I really like magic and magicians, so I thought Jace was just right for what I wanted to do.”

“My best friend from school, he’s a cosplayer too. He insisted to me so much that we had to cosplay together, and I loved it. That was three years ago. Now I’m doing it more professionally, getting paid for it. I picked Avacyn because I looked at her artwork and I was, like, woah! I’d never done something with wings and armour, it was a personal challenge. It was awesome, I hope I pulled it off.”
