MOCS Season 3 Starts Wednesday

Once Season 2's Qualifier Points expire on Wednesday morning Pacific time, all events and Leagues with QP prizes will provide Season 3 versions. Be sure to review the Season 3 Event Calendar at the bottom of the [MTGO Premier Play info page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2020#season3) to see when you can use them.


Expired Season 2 QPs will be removed from accounts during the next downtime on August 26.

Showcase Qualifier Weekend

Players who earned entry into the Showcase Qualifier will be squaring off for an invitation to the Champions Showcase.
