 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






So you've created some commons. The second Design Challenge is going to follow exactly what **Magic** design does when we finish designing commons—we design more commons! As Aaron likes to say, "You don't get to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel until you've finished putting in the floor."

The twist is that last time we let you choose what color to design. This week we're choosing the color for you. And yes, we're very deliberate in what color each of you got. (Hint: it wasn't the easy one to do.) Here are your assignments:

Ethan Fleisher – Blue  
 Jonathan Loucks – White  
 Shawn Main – Blue  
 Devon Rule – White  
 Scott Van Essen – Red  
 Daniel Williams – Green  
 Jonathan Woodward – Black

The assignment is the same as Design Challenge #1. You need to design eighteen cards of the color selected for you. Please lay out the cards in the same way as requested in Design Challenge #1. For your logline this time, I'd like you to think of the poster selling your set. Right below the logo is your logline. Don't just tell me about your set, sell me on it. (Think more active words and compelling imagery.)

Along with everything we were looking for in the first challenge, here are some additional things to keep in mind:

**Show Us the Big Picture:** This second set of commons isn't just about how your set fits into that color but how that color fits into your set. Make sure what you show us hints at your larger vision. (Remember this competition is, at its core, about your ability to execute your vision.)

**Listen to the Judges:** We made a lot of comments over the last two weeks. A big part of this challenge is showing us that you can incorporate our notes.

**Make It All Work Together:** The first GDS had no through-line from challenge to challenge. That's not the case for GDS2. Remember as you build your new cards what your old cards are doing.

**Details Matter:** This contest is getting heated. Take the time to make sure you dot your i's and cross your t's. In particular, don't let your submission leave out any relevant information.

The deadline for this submission is 11:59 EST (8:59 PST) on Sunday, November 28. Please submit them to both emails you have.

Good luck!
