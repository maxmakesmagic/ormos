Born in the ancient days of **Magic**'s *Alpha* set, [fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=fireball) has been scorching armies, finishing off blockers, and of course, directly roasting opponents for a decade.


Now, thanks to *[Darksteel](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/expansion/darksteel)*, Fireball is back.


### Change of mana cost


Back in 1993, Fireball cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif), with an additional cost specified in its text box to pay for any additional char-broil targets beyond the first. Since the *Beatdown Box Set*, Fireball's mana cost had been ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif)Y![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif): the only Y in **Magic** outside of *[The Ultimate Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=The%2BUltimate%2BNightmare)*. The Y indicated the number of additional targets among which to distribute the damage.



Once *Darksteel* becomes legal in tournaments on February 20, 2004, [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)'s official [Oracle](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=dci/oracle) mana cost will change back, and its rules text will change. It has returned to the traditional ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) mana cost, and the additional cost for targets is again specified in the card's rules text -- but it cooks, bakes and broils just the same as it always has.


### Change of rarity


In addition, [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) is uncommon in *Darksteel*, so that it doesn't ruin draft and sealed deck play for *Mirrodin* block. Remember, despite being an enormous rolling boulder of flame, Fireball is a remarkably efficient and flexible tool for its cost. R&D considered it wise if draft and sealed decks didn't contain too many of them!


### Change of art


Lastly, as you can see above (or maybe you've seen it already, if you were lucky enough to open it in your packs at the *Darksteel* prerelease), Fireball's art has changed for the first time in history. Check it out.



Have fun throwing balls of fire with the release of *Darksteel!*
