**U.S. Nationals 1999 Reports**

Round 10 Feature Match
----------------------


 **Brian Hacker vs John Yoo** 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/USNAT99/images/R10Hacker.JPG)Now 
 here's a feature match worth watching. Long time members of DKLA/Hitmen 
 Yoo and Hacker go back a long ways, but this is only the second time 
 they've played one another in a major event, and the first time they've 
 played in constructed. As the two friends sat down for their match, 
 it was apparent that this wouldn't be your usual set of duels, as trash 
 talk and laughter came in abundance.
 

After winning the die roll, John responded to Brian's first turn Pouncing 
 Jaguar with a second turn Peace of Mind, which immediately prompted 
 an 'uh oh' from Hacker. Despite dropping a rash of creatures and attacking 
 as aggressively as possible Brian could only watch as John Tutored and 
 Intuitioned for his Replenish-Yawgmoth's Bargain-Abundance-Seismic Assault 
 combo, and when he saw that John had four mana, he quickly conceded.
 

Game two saw Hacker get off to a faster start, dropping a first turn 
 Wild Dogs followed by two second turn creatures. After Tutoring for 
 an Intuition, John played a Propaganda in an attempt to slow Brian's 
 onslaught, but Hacker's Wastelands slowed down Yoo's mana development 
 too much, and he was unable to get the crucial fourth land he needed 
 to go off.
 

Game three looked bad for Hacker when he started with a mulligan, but 
 after casting a first turn Llanowar Elf, he was able to play Gaea's 
 Cradle and play two River Boas on the second turn. John played a Propaganda 
 on his turn, but Brian cast yet another Boa on his third turn and brought 
 John down to nine with a Giant Growth. As Brian drew his next card, 
 John seemed ready to go off, but Brian had top-decked a Giant Growth 
 which, when cast on one of the three attacking Boas, was just enough 
 to end the game.
