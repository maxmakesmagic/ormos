Go to the "Selecting *Eighth Edition*" promo page [here](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/vote8e/home).


There's just something about [Blood Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon). Maybe because it was the first card made to specifically thwart non-basic lands, it sticks in players' heads. It was popular in *The Dark*, it was popular when it was reprinted in *Chronicles*, now let's see if it's popular when it comes back again in *Eighth Edition*.


The art vote between the two versions of Phyrexian Colossus was about as close as a vote could get… and the Seventh Edition one wins by a nose! Well, I'm sure Mark Tedin would have been happy either way.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Which card should be in Eighth Edition? |  |  |
| Blood Moon | 5447 | 60.00% |
| Dwarven Miner | 3638 | 40.00% |
| Total | 9085 | 100% |

| Which Phyrexian Colossus art should be in Eighth Edition? |  |  |
| Seventh Edition | 4400 | 51.10% |
| Urza's Saga | 4211 | 48.90% |
| Total | 8611 | 100% |

This week will be the last week for submitting flavor text. We've done an artifact, a red card, ![Serra Angel](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/82_serra.jpg)a black card, a green card, a blue card… must be time for a white card. And what a white card it is, the iconic [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel). Serra will be appearing in *Eighth* wearing her designer outfit by Mark Zug that debuted in *Seventh Edition*. What should her new flavor text be? That's up to you. Submit your thoughts [here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=8e_submission_serraangel).


The card vote this week is between two green creatures with an appetite for enchantments: the *Legends* favorite [Rabid Wombat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rabid+Wombat), or the Urza-block beatdown machine [Yavimaya Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Enchantress). TheWombat can get bigger, but only when local enchantments are put directly on it. The Enchantress is a mana cheaper, but it's hard to compete with a wombat in the "cool" department. What do you think?


The art vote is also for a green creature, the 3/3 vanilla [Trained Armodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trained+Armodon). Hey, [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd) isn't going to be around forever! The choice is between the original *Tempest* art and the *Seventh Edition* art.


And that's that for this week… Remember that your vote counts! Be sure to cast it [here](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/vote8e/home), and tune in next week for the final set of card choices!
