2006 England National Championship
----------------------------------


A Final Champion Crowned
========================




July 29-30, 2006











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ennat06/fin.jpg)Craig Stevenson is the English National Champion!


After 12 rounds of swiss competition the 120 players in English nationals have been reduced to just one.


Craig Stevenson is the Leeds based editor of Magic website StarCityGames.com, whose previous pro level experience was a top 32 at the Pro Tour and one Grand Prix top eight. Now he can add to this already impressive list the title of English National Champion - a title that he will hold for the foreseeable future as the tournament is merged into being part of UK nationals from 2007.


The national team in full will feature Reading based student Calum Stephenson, who fought it out in a very tight final with Craig, and MoxRadio team member Andrew 'Boomer' Clayton of Manchester.


The latest tech from the UK seems to be all about controlling the board with Wrath of God, [Glare of Subdual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual), followed up by Elephants. Even the Zoo deck that made the finals had [Loxodon Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) and [Glare of Subdual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual) in the sideboard. Indeed it was three Hierarchs that won the final game of Nationals. The Elephants will now march on Paris, where Team England will do it's best to take the world crown!

Sunday, July 30: 9:17 a.m. - Maw Power!
---------------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ennat06/maw.jpg)*Maw ha ha ha!*
Going into day 2 of Nationals, Tom Harle is feeling pretty good. He's 6-1, and has one of the sillier *Coldsnap* draft decks in the room. Sporting 4 black rares, he has the opportunity to pull off a combo rarely seen in draft.


Tom has two copies of [Garza's Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garza%27s+Assassin), which is pretty nifty in and of itself. Where things get really fun though, is with [Void Maw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Maw). This big beater has great synergy with such cards as [Disciple of Tevesh Szat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Tevesh+Szat), but gets all the nuttier when the Assassin is thrown in - all of a sudden his recover trigger can be carefully controlled - he can sit in the Maw's mouth waiting to go to the graveyard until just the right moment to actually die. Opponents have a slightly trickier time dealing with Recover though, as the [Void Maw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Maw) spits monsters out at the appropriate moment.


Sometimes it tramples in for lots too!
