### Korey Age vs. Tom Martell

*Tom Martell* |

Both players spent their first turn doing a little searching, [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) for Age and [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) for Martell. When he got his head out of the clouds, Martell dropped a second-turn [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance). A blind activation on a [Lotus Petal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal) yielded a land, keeping Age at bay. Martell found a [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) soon there after to try and assemble the combo. Age was ready with a [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), but Martell had a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) to ensure it hit play.


A [Wipe Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wipe+Away) from Age threatened to clear the way by removing the [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance). Martel, who had just stacked his deck knew he didn't have a three drop on top for a [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) trigger, so he just picked the enchantment up. When Age tried to go for a [Show and Tell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) in the vacuum, Martel stopped him with a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell).


At this point, [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) began the beats. A 4/5 beater kept turning sideways under the watchful eye of a freshly recast [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). A couple of turns later, after having two of his spells stopped at the hands of [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) and Top, Age went for one more [Show and Tell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell). Martell revealed an Oblivion ring with his [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance), and Age conceded.

*Korey Age* |

On the second turn of the second game, Martell tried to drop a [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) into play. It met a [Red Elemental Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast), which met a [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), which met a [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze), which met a shrug from Martell. All four spells hit the graveyard. Martell followed that up with a [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), and the green monster began to eat away at Age's life. A turn later, during Age's draw step, Martell aimed a [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) at him. [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) kept some secrets, but dropped Age to two cards. One of them was [Sneak Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack), but Martell had a [Krosan Grip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Grip) ready for it. The next two turns were elementary for Martell, who just turned his 6/7 [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) sideways twice to kill Age and advance to the semifinals.

### Jason Ford vs. Chris Gosselin


Gosselin started his quarterfinals match with a mulligan. When Ford tried for a [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) on the second turn, Gosselin stopped it with a [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce). Unfortunately, this left him with no answer to the second one played on the following turn. Under the cover of a [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill), Ford's [Mishra's Factory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory) began to attack. Rather than simply take the beats, Gosselin brought an [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) to [Show and Tell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell). All Ford had was a lousy [Underground Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea). The massive monster wouldn't even see an untap, though. Ford quickly dispatched it with an [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood).


After hiding a card away under a [Shelldock Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelldock+Isle), Gosselin was forced to find an answer to a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). His [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) found him no help, and the mighty planeswalker hit play. It immediately went to work fatesealing Ford, keeping the cards on top. He was clearly going for a win via Jace's ultimate.

*Chris Gosselin* |

Gosselin tried to set things up with a [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), but a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) stopped it. [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) stopped a [Doomsday](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomsday), and it seemed Gosselin was running out of time, and fast. A fateseal stole a [Stifle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) from Gosselin, making sure that the ultimate would go off without a hitch.


In order to protect himself from whatever Gosselin had hidden under his [Shelldock Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelldock+Isle), Ford brought back a [Life from the Loam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) to get a couple of [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s out of his graveyard. With the Isle removed, he could ultimate with impunity. Rather than force Ford to go through the motions, Gosselin just conceded.


Jason Ford 1 – Chris Gosselin 0


Both players had staples for their decks in their opening draws. Gosselin had a [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), while Ford had a [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill). In response to the [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill), Gosselin cracked his [Marsh Flats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flats) and tried to fish for a new set of three cards.


"I just put these back," he exclaimed after receiving his deck back after a cut.


"It was that Asian Ninja Cut. You never stood a chance," Ford smiled.


After the [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) resolved, Ford went to work building his mana. A few turns of land-go prompted Gosselin to ask, "You really did this all day?" With a hand full of counters, Ford felt comfortable enough to start sending his [Mishra's Factory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory). Gosselin's life started decreasing slowly by twos. Gosselin, still bitter about losing his [Shelldock Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelldock+Isle) last game, broke the [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) with an [Extirpate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate) on [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland). Upon seeing Ford's hand, he sighed.


"I know; it's a little obnoxious."


Two [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s, two [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish)es, two [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood)s, two [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)s, a [Life from the Loam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam), and a [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) are a little more than what I'd call obnoxious. Still, over the next couple of turns, Gosselin began the arduous process of removing answers from Ford's hand. After fishing out a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) with a [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), he went for the [Doomsday](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomsday). Ford tried to stop it with a [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will). Gosselin had a Force of his own, and the powerful black sorcery resolved.

*Jason Ford* |

A library of [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), [Shelldock Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelldock+Isle), Emrakul, [Cloud of Faeries](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries), and [Solitary Confinement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solitary+Confinement) joined a hand of [Shared Fate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shared+Fate) and [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) as Gosselin's last seven cards. Ford dropped a [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) and sent the turn. As the next couple of turns passed, Ford saw his chance. At the end of one of Gosselin's turns, Ford cast a [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). This popped the [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill), forcing Gosselin to draw three cards, which would kill him. In response, Gosselin had a [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) to retrigger the [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill), sending the cards the other way. Ford was ready with a [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) to send the cards back at Gosselin. Gosselin had one last hope, a [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) of his own, to send keep himself from decking. Unfortunately, Ford had one more copy of [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) to send three cards Gosselin's way, killing him during his end step.
