![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds04/trophy_money.jpg)Pro Tour Philadelphia will experiment with a radically new payout schedule when it happens May 6-8. Instead of basing prize winnings on the final standings, players will be playing for a certain set amount of cash in each and every round. Loosely based off of the "skins" style payouts seen sometimes in sports like golf or bowling, this change should make for a very exciting event.

Here's how the experimental payout will work:

* The tournament will be "triple elimination." That is, once a player picks up loss #3, he or she will be automatically dropped from the field. (Swiss Pairings will continue to be used to pair the players still competing.)
* Draws are worth zero points (and count as a loss for elimination purposes) and the two players will split the money from that round.
* There will be 6 rounds of preliminary competition on Friday and 6 more on Saturday. The Top 8 people at the end of round 12 will advance to Sunday's single-elimination Top 8. (It is likely that someone who picks up their 3rd loss in round 12 will "back in" to the Top 8.)

Here's what players will be playing for:



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Round** | **$/Match** |
| 1 | 100 |
| 2 | 100 |
| 3 | 100 |
| 4 | 125 |
| 5 | 150 |
| 6 | 200 |
| 7 | 250 |
| 8 | 300 |
| 9 | 500 |
| 10 | 750 |
| 11 | 1000 |
| 12 | 1500 |
| QF | 2500 |
| SF | 5000 |
| F | 10000 |

Estimated Total Payout: **$203,675**.

DCI Program manager Scott Larabee said "There's no chance we'll switch to this payout permanently, but we think it will be fun to mix things up in this way every once in a while." [Qualifiers for Pro Tour Philadelphia begin this weekend](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=protour/philadelphia05/qualifiers). The qualifiers use the Extended constructed format, while the Pro Tour itself will be *Kamigawa* Block Constructed.
