2013 Hall of Famer William Jensen and Grand Prix Charlotte Champion Frank Skarren both had brutally powerful decks that propelled them through the first two rounds of the first draft with two wins each. While Skarren had a traditional blue-black deck with plenty of anti-aggro options and some potentially powerful curves involving [Disciple of Phenax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax) and [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), Jensen had a less traditional multi-color deck that is capable of hitting its necessary colors with multiple copies of [Nylea's Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Presence).


Would blue-black take down their first pod, or would [Nylea's Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Presence) guide the Hall of Fame member to victory instead?


### The Games


[Nylea's Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Presence) was Jensen's first play, giving him some mana fixing, while Skarren led with [Baleful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Eidolon), starting the game with only six cards. Jensen had a second Presence on the third turn, and revealed three colors when he played an Island to go with his Forests and Swamp when he cast [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) on the fourth turn.


[Disciple of Phenax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax) revealed what was going on when Jensen revealed three of his five cards: [Pharika's Cure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure), [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide), and [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). "Nothing much," Jensen said.

"Five-Color Green?" Skarren asked. "I was five-color green fourteen years ago," Jensen retorted with a smile. [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) hit the bin and play passed back to Jensen, who used [Pharika's Cure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure) on the [Baleful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Eidolon). The [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) attacked in and a [Reverent Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter) came after that, entering as a 5/5 creature. [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) gave Skarren a life swing, but [Keepsake Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keepsake+Gorgon) from Jensen put the Grand Prix Charlotte Champion on the back pedal. [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock) from Skarren cleared away the Gorgon and bought some time against Jensen's powerful deck.


A second [Disciple of Phenax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax) nabbed a [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) a turn later, but Jensen was racing. His [Reverent Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter) and [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) gave him a serious clock that Skarren had to contend with. The race tipped into Jensen's favor when he had a second [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) for the [Horizon Scholar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Scholar). A bestowed [Nylea's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary) on the [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) a turn later was enough for Skarren to pack it in.


Skarren had the first action of the second game with a second-turn [Returned Phalanx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Phalanx) and third-turn [Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn). This accelerated a fourth turn [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) into play, which drained Jensen for 3 when it came in. Jensen had some action of his own on the third turn however with [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr). A Mountain revealed that Jensen had four colors in his deck, and he passed back.


[Disciple of Phenax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax) revealed all but one card from Jensen's hand: Forest, Swamp, Swamp, [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock), and [Lash of the Whip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+of+the+Whip). He discarded the Lash, then sent in his team, losing [Returned Phalanx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Phalanx) to the [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr). However, Jensen's unrevealed card was [Pharika's Mender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Mender), bringing back his dead [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr).

*Frank Skarren*

The Mender halted attacks from Skarren, who deployed [Blood-Toll Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Toll+Harpy). Jensen now had the turn to go on the offensive, attacking for 4 before casting [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp). Skarren, however, was finding himself on the receiving end of some mana flood, as he was out of any spells to cast. Suddenly, the game reversed into Jensen's favor.


Jensen sent his big green creatures in after playing his seventh land. Skarren chump blocked the Asp with [Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn), falling to 14. That quickly became 12 when [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock) disposed of the Gray Merchant.


Skarren drew into [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock), and he quickly used it to dispose of the Asp after attacking with his remaining creatures. He passed back to Jensen, having knocked the Hall of Famer down to 9. Jensen dug with [Nylea's Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Presence), then bestowed [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) onto [Pharika's Mender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Mender), dropping Skarren to 4.


Skarren continued his attacks, dropping Jensen to 6. He added [Felhide Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felhide+Minotaur) to his board, then passed with one in hand. Jensen drew, then thought for a minute. He decided to go for lethal, bestowing [Nylea's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary) onto [Pharika's Mender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Mender). That was enough to earn the handshake from Skarren.
