One of the most fascinating stories to come from this season's Pro Tour-Honolulu Qualifier season has been the resurgence in old pros returning to the Pro Tour by way of winning a PTQ. Count Billy Moreno and Ben Stark amongst their numbers alongside the likes of Brian Kibler and Osyp Lebedowicz. Ben had to get there through none other than Antonino de Rosa! Check out their Top 8 lists below. Of course, there's still a little bit of time left to earn your plane ticket to Pro Tourâ€“Honolulu, so check out [the official PTQ schedule](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/honolulu09-qualifiers).
