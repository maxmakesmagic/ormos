***Magic Origins* Release Events Going on Now**


Release Events began at 10:00 a.m. Pacific (UTC-7) on Monday, July 27 and run through the Wednesday, August 12, downtime.


For Draft fans, the [Pack-per-Win Swiss Draft](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-magic-origins-prerelease-and-release-events-2015-06-29#ppwdraft) makes its triumphant return and runs alongside the [8-4](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-magic-origins-prerelease-and-release-events-2015-06-29#84draft) and [4-3-2-2](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-magic-origins-prerelease-and-release-events-2015-06-29#4322draft) Single Elimination Drafts in the Limited Queues Room. Try out any of the three and you'll get the Nissa, Vastwood Seer Avatar just for participating. Once you have a feel for the set, raise the stakes with the *Magic Origins* Release [64-Player Single Elimination Event](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-magic-origins-prerelease-and-release-events-2015-06-29#64playerdraft), and get the Liliana, Heretical Healer Avatar while you're at it.


Prefer Sealed? Try out the [Release Swiss Sealed](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-magic-origins-prerelease-and-release-events-2015-06-29#releasesealed) and get the Kytheon, Hero of Akros Avatar—that's the only place you'll be able to earn it throughout Release Events. If you're looking for the biggest Sealed Event with the largest prize pool, mark your calendar for the [Release *Magic Origins* Swiss Sealed](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-magic-origins-prerelease-and-release-events-2015-06-29#swisssealed). It runs in the Scheduled Events Room, and includes a Top 8 Draft. Participation in that event is one of two ways to get the Liliana, Heretical Healer Avatar.

**Path to Exile Promo Miscommunication and Fix**


When Season 9 Promos were granted during last week's downtime, it came to our attention that there was a miscommunication regarding which version of the [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) promo was being awarded to players as part of the [*Magic Online* Player Rewards](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2015-magic-online-player-rewards) program. We advertised one promo on the website and granted another during the Wednesday, July 29, downtime.


We apologize for this error in communication and would like to make it up to players by giving everyone who qualified for last month's MOPR reward the [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) promo that was advertised on [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online) in addition to the version they already received during the Wednesday, July 29, downtime. Expect to find the advertised version of [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) in your account following the Wednesday, August 12, downtime. Thank you for your understanding!

***Magic Origins* Known Issues**


**Gameplay Issues**


* Collection | When zoomed, *Magic Origins* planeswalkers display the incorrect card symbol.
* Duel Scene | Casting any red instant or sorcery automatically removes mana generated from [Pyromancer's Goggles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Goggles) if the mana is already floating in the user’s mana pool.
* Duel Scene | Creatures selected for the activated ability granted by [Consecrated by Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+by+Blood) do not have a red highlight around the card. The number of creatures remaining to sacrifice is also incorrectly not displayed in the prompt box.
* Duel Scene | [Hallowed Moonlight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Moonlight) does not create an ability in the effects zone.
* Duel Scene | [Murder Investigation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murder+Investigation) does not display “X equals” blue rules text on the stack.
* Duel Scene | The delayed triggered ability of [Liliana, Defiant Necromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+Defiant+Necromancer) incorrectly does not display association arrows with creatures sent to the graveyard.
* Duel Scene | The first loyalty ability of [Gideon, Battle-Forged](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Battle-Forged) removes attacking requirements from creatures.
* Duel Scene | The game log does not list the seven cards revealed by [Talent of the Telepath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talent+of+the+Telepath).
* Duel Scene | The mana ability of [Fertile Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground) and similar cards incorrectly provides mana when the enchanted permanent is tapped for zero mana.
* Duel Scene | Using the activated ability of [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) when five or fewer cards are in the graveyard displays a placeholder string in the game log.

**Client Issues**


* Duel Scene | In some circumstances, users are not allowed to choose the order of multiple replacement effects.
* Duel Scene | [Nissa, Sage Animist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Sage+Animist)'s third loyalty ability has an extra apostrophe in the text.
* Duel Scene | The stack window incorrectly resizes only vertically and not horizontally.
* Duel Scene | When [Sakashima the Imposter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakashima+the+Imposter) copies a [Timberpack Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberpack+Wolf), it does not get +1/+1 for other [Timberpack Wolves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=398445).

**Commander Issues**


* Duel Scene | In a Commander game, a *Magic Origins* planeswalker that is the player’s commander will not return to the battlefield transformed when its owner chooses to send it back to the command zone.
* Duel Scene | We planned to implement the Commander rule commonly referred to as the “tuck rule” with the *Magic Origins* release during the July 22 downtime. This rule, which allows a player to put his or her commander in the command zone if it would go the library or hand, is proving more difficult than originally expected to implement. Because of this, the Commander change will not go live at this time. We want to take time to ensure the rule functions correctly in a wide, wide variety of Commander game situations, and that will take more development time.
