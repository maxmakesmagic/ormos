![Pistus Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pistus+Strike)**[Pistus Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pistus+Strike)** – *Mirrodin Besieged* common. In 2007, Doug Beyer counted the creatures on [Xantid Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xantid+Swarm) and came up with [725 creatures](/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-may-2007-2007-05-01). [Pistus Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pistus+Strike) might have more, but since it can't block [Our Market Research Shows That Players Like Really Long Card Names So We Made This Card to Have the Absolute Longest Card Name Ever Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Our%2BMarket%2BResearch%2BShows%2BThat%2BPlayers%2BLike%2BReally%2BLong%2BCard%2BNames%2BSo%2BWe%2BMade%2BThis%2BCard%2Bto%2BHave%2Bthe%2BAbsolute%2BLongest%2BCard%2BName%2BEver%2BElemental), we don't need to check.
 ![Phyresis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyresis)**[Phyresis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyresis)** – *Mirrodin Besieged* common. Note the word "compleat" in the flavor text for [Phyresis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyresis). This is not a typo for "complete." Not only is "compleat" a real, albeit archaic, word, it has a specific meaning for the Phyrexians. As Doug Beyer explained in a recent [Savor the Flavor article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/128), it refers to the state of being "perfected" by the Phyrexians.
 ![Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Revelation)**[Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revelation)** – *Chronicles* rare. [Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revelation) is a World Enchantment (which was originally called an "Enchant World"), a special kind of permanent that works kind of like *Planechase*. See [this Arcana](/en/articles/archive/world-enchantments-2007-06-28) for the full scoop on how World Enchantments work.
 ![Lightning Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lightning+Dragon)**[Lightning Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Dragon)** – *Urza's Saga* rare. The first set to have premium foils randomly inserted in booster packs was *Urza's Legacy*. But in the previous set, [Lightning Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Dragon) was the Prerelease Card, and it was the very first **Magic** card to get the premium foil treatment.
 ![Tower of Calamities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tower+of+Calamities)**[Tower of Calamities](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+of+Calamities)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* rare. Back in *Mirrodin*, there were [four Tower cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5Btower%5D&set=%7C%5B%22Mirrodin%22%5D). It took some time, but *Scars of Mirrodin* completed the cycle with [Tower of Calamities](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+of+Calamities).
 ![Omega Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Omega+Myr)**[Omega Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omega+Myr)** – *Mirrodin* common. [Alpha Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr) is a 2/1 and [Omega Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omega+Myr) is a 1/2. Sadly, even if Beta Myr through Psi Myr existed, **Magic** wouldn't have the numbers required to represent their powers and toughnesses.
 ![Galvanic Key](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Galvanic+Key)**[Galvanic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Key)** – *Mirrodin* common. [Galvanic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Key) is a reworking of [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), except that it references Luigi Galvani rather than Alessandro Volta. Or they might just both be using terms related to electricity, rather than 18th-century Italian physicists. That seems more likely.
 ![Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chrome+Mox)**[Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox)** – *Mirrodin* rare. According to [this Arcana from 2004](/en/articles/archive/artist-easter-eggs-2004-04-01), you can see Karn's reflection in [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox). But since that arcana also claims you can see Britney Spears in [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) and was on April First, it's possible that it's lying.
 ![Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chalice+of+the+Void)**[Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void)** – *Mirrodin* rare. At the [2001 Magic Invitational](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2001-magic-invitational-2015-09-02) in Cape Town, South Africa, Gary Wise submitted a card called [Artifact of Doom](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/players-card-submissions-2015-09-02) to be made if he won. He didn't win, but R&D liked the card and turned it into [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void). Wise's original version cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif) instead of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif), but that got changed pretty quickly.
 ![Dwarven Warriors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dwarven+Warriors)**[Dwarven Warriors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Warriors)** – *Fifth Edition* common. The original concept of [Dwarven Warriors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Warriors) was that they'd be Dwarven *Miners*, who dig a tunnel to allow a small creature past the enemy lines. But the art showed armor that was a bit too impressive to belong to common miners, so they got promoted.
 ![Rashka the Slayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rashka+the+Slayer)**[Rashka the Slayer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rashka+the+Slayer)** – *Homelands* uncommon. Christopher Rush requested to do the art for [Rashka the Slayer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rashka+the+Slayer). "I wanted the [Baron Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir) but he was taken, so I took the character that wanted to kill him," he explained in *Duelist 7*.
 ![Urza's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Urza%27s+Bauble)**[Urza's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Bauble)** – *Ice Age* uncommon. The original flavor text for [Urza's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Bauble) read, "This margin will not permit a description of the ingenious bauble." But it turned out to be too accurate: it wouldn't fit on the card.
 ![Volrath's Stronghold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Volrath%27s+Stronghold)**[Volrath's Stronghold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath%27s+Stronghold)** – *Stronghold* rare. According to *Duelist 23*, [Volrath's Stronghold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath%27s+Stronghold) is big enough to hold "a dozen [Polar Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polar+Kraken)s, a score of [Phyrexian Dreadnought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought)s, and still have enough space for a football field." And that's just the living quarters!
 ![Soulshriek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soulshriek)**[Soulshriek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulshriek)** – *Mirage* common. [Soulshriek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulshriek) was originally named "Damien's Cry," a reference to Bill Rose's howling cat.
 ![Animate Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Animate+Artifact)**[Animate Artifact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Artifact)** – *Masters Edition IV* uncommon. Originally, [Animate Artifact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Artifact) could affect artifacts that were already creatures, but when it was printed in *Revised*, it got the sentence "Has no effect on artifact creatures" added to its rules text.
 ![Sword of Kaldra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sword+of+Kaldra)**[Sword of Kaldra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Kaldra)** – *Mirrodin* rare. Speaking of Living Weapons, how about a sword that can eventually generate something to carry it? It requires [Shield of Kaldra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shield+of+Kaldra) and [Helm of Kaldra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Kaldra) to work, but to be fair, Kaldra is a bit more impressive than a 0/0 Germ.
 ![Ensouled Scimitar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ensouled+Scimitar)**[Ensouled Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensouled+Scimitar)** – *Fifth Dawn* uncommon. While [Dancing Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dancing+Scimitar) is always a creature (which may or may not have a soul), [Ensouled Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensouled+Scimitar) is a sword that become a creature (but always has a soul). What is it with scimitars?
 ![Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas)**[Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas)** – *Mirrodin Besieged* mythic rare. Wondering how [Tezzeret the Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret+the+Seeker) became a slave of [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker)? Part of the story can be seen in the web comic [The Seeker's Fall](/en/node/628096).
 ![Virulent Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Virulent+Wound)**[Virulent Wound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Virulent+Wound)** – *Mirrodin Besieged* common. In the art for [Virulent Wound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Virulent+Wound), the goblin (named "Gerkk," apparently) shows his infection in the form of the huge boils that cover his back. And he's trying to get back home, which, of course, will only spread the disease.
 ![Skinrender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Skinrender)**[Skinrender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinrender)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* uncommon. Note that it's called "[Skinrender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinrender)," not "Skinrender*er*." It rends skin, rather than rendering it.
 ![Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Juggernaut)**[Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut)** – *Masters Edition IV* uncommon. When Extended was first created, [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) was banned, due to its alleged unstoppability when combined with [Invisibility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invisibility). That was a different time.
 ![Pit Scorpion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pit+Scorpion)**[Pit Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Scorpion)** – *Legends* common. The first appearance of poison in **Magic** was on [Pit Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Scorpion) and [Serpent Generator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serpent+Generator) in *Legends*. Those two cards, along with *The Dark*'s [Marsh Viper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Viper), were also in *Fifth Edition*, which was the last core set to include poison.
