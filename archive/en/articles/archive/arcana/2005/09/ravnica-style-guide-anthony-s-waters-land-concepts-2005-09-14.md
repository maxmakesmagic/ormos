In the spirit of this week's [feature article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/284) by **Magic** art director Jeremy Cranford, today in Magic Arcana we look at *land*. In particular we take the opportunity to crack open that dusty *Ravnica*  style guide to focus on concept sketches for Ravnica's urban environments by one Anthony S. Waters.

[Anthony](http://www.thinktankstudios.com/) has illustrated over 60 pieces of **Magic**  art since *Tempest*, and has created landscapes such as [Yavimaya Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Coast) and [Windswept Heath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath) as well as dozens of creatures and other spells from [Mortivore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortivore) to [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus).

Anthony's contribution didn't stop with the *Ravnica*  style guide; he also contributed a cycle of basic land art for *Ravnica*. You'll see those at the [prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/prereleases) -- but for now, check out these gorgeous sketches from the style guide.
