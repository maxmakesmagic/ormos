Gary explained, in so many words, that the "T" was for "Talim," and the "M.F." stood for what "M.F." usually stands for in gangsta lingo.

Eivind laughed and said, "Oh, I thought it was 'My First Tour.'"

While Eivind is a veteran of many tours, it is both players' first Top 8. And, interestingly enough, they both drafted green/red. Nitter has a big advantage, though, as his high-end spells include [Beast Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Attack), plus he has a 2-to-1 advantage on [Leaf Dancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaf+Dancer)s.

Gary T started out quickly in Game 1 with [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog) and [Ember Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Beast). Nitter tried to race with a [Krosan Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Avenger), but he was forced to trade a 2/3 [Krosan Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Archer) with the [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog) when Gary T [Reckless Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge)d it.

Eivind dropped a [Cartographer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartographer) and swung with the Avenger again, bringing the life totals to 15 to 14 in his favor. Talim upped the ante with a [Centaur Chieftain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Chieftain) and swung with the team. Eivind had a [Muscle Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst), so he thought for awhile before blocking the [Ember Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Beast) with the Cart and then Bursting. It always sucks to kill the Ember Beats when there's a chance you can strand it by killing everything else, but sometimes you just have to bite the bullet, and Eivind made a good play by doing so.

Nitter drew his second [Muscle Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst) and attacked with just the Avenger again. Gary untapped, drew, and [Blazing Salvo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Salvo)ed Eivind's only blocker – [Cartographer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartographer) – before attacking. Eivind [Muscle Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst)ed it in response and let it take 3 damage. Talim, thinking Eivind's Cart was 5/5, attacked with his own Cart. Eivind blocked, and Gary was quite surprised when re realized Eivind's survived because it was actually 6/6 due to the first [Muscle Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst) in the graveyard. The American looked quite crestfallen at his mistake.

Talim made a [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest) and passed the turn. Eivind then made a great play of [Refresh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Refresh)ing his own Avenger, and Sonic Seizuring Talim's Chieftain in response, pitching a land. The card he drew off [Refresh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Refresh)? Another [Sonic Seizure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sonic+Seizure). Eivind attacked Talim down to 2 and then Seizured him out on the next turn.

Nitter 1 – Talim 0

Nitter leafed through his sideboard, and started chuckling when he found a [Pitchstone Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pitchstone+Wall) waiting there. He sided it in for a [Skyshooter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyshooter), and also sided in a [Cartographer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartographer) for an [Acorn Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acorn+Harvest), figuring the second Cart could help hold the ground if Gary drew his Nest again.

Game 2 was not close. Eivind kept a hand of 5 land, [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt), and [Rites of Initiation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Initiation), and never actually drew a creature card. He [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt)ed Gary T's [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla), and later flashed it back on a [Krosan Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Avenger), but couldn't stop [Spark Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spark+Mage) or [Cartographer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartographer). [Elephant Ambush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Ambush) traded for [Centaur Chieftain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Chieftain), but Eivind was dangerously low on life. There was one point where Eivind could have killed a couple creatures with [Temporary Insanity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporary+Insanity) if he had more cards in his graveyard. He cast [Rites of Initiation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Initiation) (with no creatures on his side) just to fill the graveyard, but lost the Insanity at random and scooped.

Nitter 1 – Talim 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptnice02/a696.jpg)Eivind's poor luck continued into the start of game 3; he had to mulligan a 0-land draw. Talim started quickly with a turn-1 Rootwalla, a [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) for Eivind's [Krosan Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Avenger), then a [Spark Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spark+Mage).

Eivind took a lot of early damage but eventually got out a [Possessed Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Possessed+Centaur) that blocked the Rootwalla and was [Refresh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Refresh)ed. He then played a [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest) and dug in. Unfortunately for fans of the fast game, Talim played his own Nest, and the token generation began in earnest.

Nitter kept attacking with one squirrel, offering a trade. Talim declined; he was happy taking one per turn and letting things build up so that he could eventually win with [Centaur Chieftain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Chieftain) or Rites.

Nitter wasn't drawing much – he put out Leafy MFD ([Leaf Dancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaf+Dancer)) and [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger), just to force Gary T's hand. [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) died at the hands of [Barbarian Lunatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Lunatic), and Leafy MFD was [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt)ed out of the 'yard. Eivind eventually upgraded his one-squirrel attacks to one-[Possessed Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Possessed+Centaur) attacks. Talim kept taking the damage, hoping to draw one of his winners. It didn't happen.

With both players at 7, Nitter sent in the Centaur again, and when Talim declined to block, he [Muscle Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst)ed it for +4/+4 and the game.

Talim had the Rites in hand and claimed he would have won on the next turn, but Nitter was holding [Acorn Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acorn+Harvest), which he planned to cast had the Centaur plan fallen through.

Nitter 2 – Talim 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptnice02/a701.jpg)This was best-of-five, so there was still more Magic to be played. Nitter sided in two [Nantuko Calmer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Calmer)s for a [Cartographer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartographer) and a [Krosan Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Archer); he was clearly getting tired of dealing with Talim's [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest).

Game 4 started slowly; Talim's turn-3 Avenger was [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt)ed, and Nitter missed his fourth land drop, settling for [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest) on a tapped land.

Talim brought forth Leafy MFD and got in two attacks with it before Nitter [Sonic Seizure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sonic+Seizure)d it, discarding [Beast Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Attack). Nitter made an [Elephant Ambush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Ambush) token and got one hit in, but Gary double-[Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt)ed it on his next turn. Eventually Gary got his Nest upp and running, and once again the squirrel tokens looked to take over both sides of the board.

But this time, Eivind had a good answer: [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger). Gary T couldn'r keep his squirrels around for long once the red pinger went active. Nitter flashbacked his [Beast Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Attack), swung for a whole bunch, and [Sonic Seizure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sonic+Seizure)d for the match.

**Final Result:** Nitter 3 – Talim 1

Nitter now goes on to face Svend Geertsen in the semifinals.
