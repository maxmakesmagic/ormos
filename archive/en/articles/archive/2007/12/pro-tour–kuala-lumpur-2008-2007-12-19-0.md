### Player Q&A


The recent announcement of the 2008 **Magic: The Gathering**  Premier Event Schedule, as well as the changes we’re making to the Pro Players’ Club, have raised a number of questions within the player community. Therefore, a one-hour Q&A session with Chris Galvin, Vice President of Organized Play, and Scott Larabee, DCI Program Manager, will be held on the Friday evening after the last round of the Pro Tour in the draft area. All Pro Tour–Kuala Lumpur competitors are encouraged to attend.
