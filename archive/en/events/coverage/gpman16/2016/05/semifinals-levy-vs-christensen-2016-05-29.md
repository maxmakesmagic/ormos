This semifinals pitted together Hall of Famer Raphaël Lévy from France and Grand Prix Gothenburg 2013 winner Oscar Christensen from Denmark. Both were playing a Green-White Token deck with many cards in common, except for one peculiarity: Levy was splashing red for [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) with no red lands whatsoever! He relied solely on 4 [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) to cast the planeswalker. "It's very good," Lévy told me with a smile.


**Game 1**


Lévy got to be on the play as a result of having a higher rank after the Swiss portion of the tournament. He had a good start to the game as he used two [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) to set up [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar) and [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) on turns three and four—a nice planeswalker tag team.

After that, however, Lévy was stuck with [Stasis Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Snare), two [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn), [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller), and another copy of [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) in hand. With his mana configuration of Forest, Forest, Plains, and [Westvale Abbey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Westvale+Abbey), he was unable to cast any of those cards.


Meanwhile, Christensen did have the right mana, so he was able to develop his board, eventually pressuring Levy's planeswalkers enough to get them off the table. Several turns later, once Levy had drawn a land, the board state was as follows:


Levy – [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) and a 0/1 Plant token


Christensen – an [Avacyn, the Purifier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%2C+the+Purifier) with a +1/+1 counter, a 4/5 [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate), 3 Thopter tokens, and a Gideon emblem.


Levy still seemed to be way behind, but miraculously he managed to turn the tide. He transformed his [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn), used [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) and [Stasis Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Snare) to deal with Christensen's main threats, and attacked for lethal several turns later.

Lévy seemed surprised himself. "I didn't think I was going to win that game," he said. "No, I also thought I had it," Christensen replied.


While sideboarding, the players discussed some of the plays that they made during the game. Christensen felt that he should have used [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) to force Levy to sacrifice his [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) on turn three. "I didn't know you lacked double white at that point, but it would have prevented you from casting [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) on turn four. It would have been a good play against you anyway because you need [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) to cast [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller)."


Levy also felt he messed up. "I took [Westvale Abbey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Westvale+Abbey) instead of a basic Plains with [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) on turn one, and I got really punished for that." It's always the small things that can have a big impact.


**Game 2**


Christensen got to be on the play this game, and he had a fast draw: turn-two [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate), turn-three [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar), turn-four [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command), turn-five [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn).

Meanwhile, Levy was stuck on four lands again, but his durdling with [Evolutionary Leap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolutionary+Leap) and [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) was not going to be good enough this time around. Christensen had already amassed 10 power on the board, a planeswalker on six loyalty, and it didn't take long for him to win that game.

**Game 3**


Levy continued the trend of being stuck on a low amount of lands, but once again he made the best of it. A key play happened on turn four. He had [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) on the battlefield (which he had played face-up on turn two) while Christensen had [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) and [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar). With that board state, Levy used the -2 ability of his own [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar) and subsequently cast [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) to put another +1/+1 counter on his [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) and fight [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate).


That evasive 4/3 meant that Levy could deal with Christensen's [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar) right away and would be able to attack any new planeswalker that Christensen would have.


A while later, Christensen tried to fight back with [Linvala, the Preserver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+the+Preserver), but Levy just kept pumping his [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector). Another counter from Nissa and another [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) yielded a six-power creature that could attack into the 5/5 flier unopposed. Christensen found [Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone) as an answer and started to produce ground blockers with Nissa and Gideon, but by that time he was already down to a dangerously low 7 life. That face-up [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) had done a lot of work!


With Christensen already down to a low life total, Levy had a good way to win: with [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command), he forced his [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) to fight [Linvala, the Preserver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+the+Preserver), and all of his Thopter tokens got another boost from Nissa. Christensen, meanwhile, kept a good poker face, not giving anything away, but once Levy attacked with all of his boosted fliers, Christensen smiled and extended his hand in defeat.

Levy moves on to the finals, and went off to rebook his flight…to Costa Rica. "I am going to travel around the country with my wife before playing in the Grand Prix next weekend, and I needed to make the Finals to miss my flight," he explained. "I have to book a new one now, but I'm still very happy I get to compete in the finals!"
