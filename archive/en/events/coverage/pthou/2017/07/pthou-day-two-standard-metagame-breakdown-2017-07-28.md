463 aspirants arrived in Kyoto for Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*, but only 288 achieved the essential 4-4 or better record. This represented 62.2 percent of the field making the Day Two cut, which for purposes of discussion we will be using as the benchmark. Consolidating [Day One's Standard Metagame Breakdown](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/pthou/pthou-day-1-standard-metagame-breakdown-2017-07-28) and comparing it side by side against that of Day Two's, which decks did better than average, and which decks failed to stack up?




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Archetype | Day 1 | Day 2 | Conversion |
| Black-Red Aggro | 7 | 6 | 85.7% |
| Black-Green Constrictor | 45 | 35 | 77.8% |
| Ramunap Red | 115 | 84 | 73.0% |
| Mono Black Zombies | 53 | 36 | 67.9% |
| Blue-Red Control | 29 | 19 | 65.5% |
| Temur Energy | 17 | 11 | 64.7% |
| Red-Green Ramp | 24 | 15 | 62.5% |
| Mardu Vehicles | 33 | 20 | 60.6% |
| Temur Emerge | 7 | 4 | 57.1% |
| White-Blue God-Pharaoh's Gift | 18 | 10 | 55.6% |
| Red-Green Pummeler | 9 | 5 | 55.6% |
| White-Blue Flash | 6 | 3 | 50.0% |
| Mono Red Eldrazi | 4 | 2 | 50.0% |
| Blue-Black Zombies | 9 | 4 | 44.4% |
| Black-Red Midrange | 16 | 7 | 43.8% |
| White-Blue Monument | 17 | 7 | 41.2% |
| Others | 54 | 20 | 37.0% |

Taking a closer look at the five biggest archetypes, Black-Green Constrictor performed the best, boasting a 77.8 percent conversion rate, which was a few steps above the average of 62.2 percent. [Winding Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor)-centric strategies were paying off for their respective pilots, and it remained one of the key archetypes in Standard.


The second best-performing rate in terms of conversion rate was Ramunap Red, which had a 73 percent conversion rate. Of the 115 players who ran along with [Falkenrath Gorger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Gorger), [Village Messenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Village+Messenger), and [Earthshaker Khenra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthshaker+Khenra), a whopping 84 of them made Day Two, which meant that we will be seeing a lot of it today. It is not unreasonable to assume that a few copies would make the Top 8, given that it occupied 29.1% of the Day Two field, more than yesterday's 24.8%. Interpreting this data, this indicated that competitors were more likely to face Ramunap Red today compared to yesterday.


Mono-Black Zombies had the third best conversion rate, at 67.9 percent, which was also above the field's average of 62.2 percent. Additionally, if you factor in four copies of Blue-Black Zombies, that's a total of 40 Zombie decks in Day 2, which is still a significant proportion. Just like [Dread Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Wanderer) and [Relentless Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relentless+Dead), rest assured that they will be returning with a vengeance.


Interestingly, when it came to the fourth and fifth-ranked archetypes, Blue-Red Control was the one with the better conversion rate—albeit only slightly—than Mardu Vehicles. Considering the dominance of [Toolcraft Exemplar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toolcraft+Exemplar) and [Heart of Kiran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Kiran) decks coupled with the downswing of [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk) in the last six months, this was a refreshing reversal of fortune. This was also a sign that the metagame remained volatile, and no deck could stay the king of the format forever.


Surprisingly, six out of seven Black-Red Aggro players made the cut. The game plan was similar to Ramunap Red, except that it eschewed the Deserts package in favor of [Dread Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Wanderer), [Ammit Eternal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ammit+Eternal), [Cut // Ribbons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cut+%2F%2F+Ribbons), and [Unlicensed Disintegration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration) among other options. Given the small sample space, it may not be fair to assume it was the best deck, but 85.7 percent is nonetheless an impressive statistic for a hybrid brew.


Last but not least, there were 54 decks which we categorized under "Others", and they were the decks with only three or less copies. Only 20 of these players made it through to Day 2. For the sake of providing our viewers with the exhaustive overall picture, here are even more statistics for your perusal!

With only five more Constructed rounds to go, things were starting to heat up and all eyes were turned towards the race for Constructed Master. The shape of the metagame in upcoming months will also be sculpted depending on which decks break into the Top 8!
