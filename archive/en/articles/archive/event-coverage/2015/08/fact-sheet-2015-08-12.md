Just a few short years ago, CNN.com published an article that listed fifty reasons why London is the greatest city in the world. On the weekend of August 14th-16th, the *Magic: The Gathering* community will get a chance to add a fifty-first reason to that list... as StarCityGames.com proudly presents Grand Prix London!  
  

Grand Prix London will be a three-day extravaganza celebrating all things *Magic: The Gathering*, headlined by a Standard-format main event. And because thousands of fans are expected to attend the party, we’ve secured a massive space at the world-famous ExCeL London Exhibition and Convention Centre in which to host them!  
  

For many fans, Grand Prix offer a number of opportunities to meet some of their favorite *Magic: The Gathering* artists, and Grand Prix London’s Artist Alley is going to feature some incredibly talented ones... including Chris Rallis, Karl Kopinski, rk post, and Svetlin Velinov!  
  

Grand Prix London’s Artist Alley will continue to expand over the next couple of months, so be sure to bookmark this site and check back often.  
  

Speaking of artists, StarCityGames.com-run Grand Prix always feature a special Guest of Honor, and Grand Prix London is no exception. Please join us in welcoming our Grand Prix London Guest of Honor… Aleksi Briclot!  
  

Normally, this is the part where I’d move on to announcing some of the many other reasons why Grand Prix London is going to be such a memorable and fun-filled event, but since Grand Prix London will mark the first time StarCityGames.com has ever organized an event across the pond, we decided to commemorate the occasion by inviting a SECOND Guest of Honor!  
  

And we were beyond thrilled when the legendary John Avon accepted our invitation!  
  

Chris Rallis, Karl Kopinski, rk post, and Svetlin Velinov? Confirmed.  
  

Aleksi Briclot? Confirmed.  
  

John Avon? Confirmed.  
  

And even MORE artists still to be announced?  
  

Confirmed. :)  
  

But a Grand Prix is not just about incredible artists. It’s also about special attractions… and Grand Prix London definitely has some sweet ones!


\*\*\* The StarCityGames.com Prize Wall… at which we’ll be offering an extensive selection of out-of-print Grand Prix promotional items (including [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) playmats, [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+19571) playmats/sleeves/deck boxes/collectible pins, [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) playmats/sleeves/deck boxes/collectible pins and more), a massive inventory of individual booster packs from Revised to *Magic Origins* and everything in between, uncut sheets, exclusive art prints and oversized cards, complete sets in both foil and non-foil, a wide assortment of StarCityGames.com Creature and Parody Collection playmats and sleeves … and tons more!  
  

\*\*\* Over a dozen of the world’s biggest and best *Magic: The Gathering* vendors... offering one of the most extensive selections of *Magic: The Gathering* singles and sealed product ever seen at a European Grand Prix!  
  

\*\*\* The U.K.’s own Rich Hagon... hosting his incredibly popular *Magic: The Gathering* game show!  
  

\*\*\* Meet and Greets, a live seminar and exclusive Grand Prix London commemorative tokens… all featuring the stars of StarCityGames.com’s incredibly popular “VS.” Series: Brad Nelson, Todd Anderson, Tom “The Boss” Ross, Brian “BBD” Braun-Duin and Chris “CVM” VanMeter!  
  

Of course, a Grand Prix wouldn’t be a Grand Prix without the chance to acquire some sweet swag, and Grand Prix London attendees will have a number of opportunities to get their hands on collectible pins, 80 ct. packs of sleeves and playmats, all featuring…  
  

Well, our friends at Wizards won’t let me announce that until Wednesday, June 17th, so I’ll just say that it’s a sizzling hot piece of *Magic Origins* artwork… and one of our guest artists will have a really sore hand by Sunday! ;)  
  

Stay tuned for more exciting announcements about Grand Prix London!
