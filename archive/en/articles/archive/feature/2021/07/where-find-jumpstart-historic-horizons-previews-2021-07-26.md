*[Jumpstart: Historic Horizons](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/what-mtg-arenas-jumpstart-historic-horizons-2021-07-26)* previews are here! To help our readers and preview seekers, we've created this handy guide to preview seasonâ€”and have a few highlights to share upfront.


This page will help you follow along with the latest *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* by giving you the outlets we have planned on each day. The goal is to help you find what you're looking for every day and avoid engaging in previews if you so choose.


Below, you'll find a list of dates and outlets previewing cards. Once the previews are live, we'll update this article so that you can easily find them. If the link simply goes to the front of a website or social media site, that means they probably haven't previewed the card yet.


And if you just want to see all the cards that have been officially previewed in one place, you can always check out our [Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/jumpstart-historic-horizons) showing off 31 brand-new cards and our [*Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* Packet Lists article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/jumpstart-historic-horizons-packet-lists-2021-07-26), which shows off the contents of each packet. Note that the Card Image Gallery and packet lists are updated every morning, so they contain all cards previewed the previous day (and earlier), but not the day of.


For the most up-to-date listings, bookmark this page and check back regularly for all the latest previews from *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons*!
