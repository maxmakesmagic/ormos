Zainuddin powered out of the gate early with a Satyr Wanderer. Yasooka tried to off it with a [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet), but Zainuddin kept it around with a timely [Feral Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Invocation).

*Yasooka contemplates his opponent's growing army*

Zainuddin kept up the pressure with a [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp). Yasooka added his own pressure with a [Vulpine Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulpine+Goliath). Zainuddin was barely fazed by the Fox, simply adding more creatures to the battlefield. A few turns of relentless attacks later, Zainuddin wore down Yasooka's defences to take the first game.

Yasooka started the second game off with a [Polis Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polis+Crusher), while Zainuddin went with a [Nimbus Naiad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad) and a [Prescient Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prescient+Chimera). Zainuddin cast a [Sea God's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+God%27s+Revenge) to get rid of the Crusher for a brief turn, but Yasooka simply replayed it and used a [Time to Feed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+to+Feed) to off the Chimera. And as quickly as that, it was on to the deciding game for both players.


Zainuddin led things off earl with a [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin), but Yasooka had the solid [Nessian Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser) to keep things interesting. When Yasooka followed up with a [Staunch-Hearted Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staunch-Hearted+Warrior), Zainuddin flashed in a [Horizon Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Chimera), the powerful fliers cracking in overhead. Yasooka had a [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) for the [Horizon Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Chimera) during his upkeep, filtering his draw and attacking with his team, bringing the life totals to 13-11. Zainuddin flashed in a [Breaching Hippocamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breaching+Hippocamp) to keep up the pressure, and then summoned a coastline Chimera to shore up his defence.


Yasooka used a [Time to Feed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+to+Feed) on his [Staunch-Hearted Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staunch-Hearted+Warrior) to take out Zainuddin's Hippocamp, gaining some precious life in the race. Yasooka's Courser kept nibbling away, while Zainuddin went all-out offensive with both his fliers. Zainuddin had a [Nylea's Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple) to gain a few precious life points, hoarding a [Sea God's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+God%27s+Revenge) in his hand for another turn on the premise that Yasooka couldn't break through just yet.

*Zainuddin plots his path to victory*

Yasooka bestowed a [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad) on his Warrior, bringing it up to a somewhat terrifying 8 power, earning a groan from Zainuddin. He attacked with everything and Zainuddin used a [Lost in a Labyrinth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lost+in+a+Labyrinth) to keep himself out of danger's reach, albeit only briefly. If there was ever a time to [Sea God's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+God%27s+Revenge), now was it, but Zainuddin was stuck on 5 lands.


Yasooka went to bestow a [Purphoros's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%27s+Emissary) on his [Nessian Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser), drawing a [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) from Zainuddin and leaving him 'only' having to deal with the incoming 8/8 [Staunch-Hearted Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staunch-Hearted+Warrior). While Zainuddin was considering his blocks, there was a brief moment of confusion about the player's life totals. Once that had been cleared up, Zainuddin's decision became a great deal easier - he chump-blocked, untapped, and dropped an [Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form) on his Disciple to attack Yasooka for lethal.
