We spend a lot of time in Arcana showing you cool things made by Wizards of the Coast. But from time to time, we like to turn the spotlight onto *you*! Specifically, that segment of "you" that makes cool things and sends in pictures.


So! Adam Halstead has created a homemade electronic life counter. Take it away, Adam!

> The life counter is made up of about 50 cards that have been hollowed out (all but the frames cut out) and glued together. All of the electronics, which consists of a microcontroller, 4 switches, two 7-segment displays, a motion switch, and 2 AAA batteries, are placed inside. It has a foil *Unhinged*  Swamp on the top with elements from [Ricochet Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap) and [Essence Scatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter) on top of it. The life counter uses two 7-segment displays to show your life total (starts at 20). You can increase or decrease your life with the press of a button. There is also a button to switch between life and poison, so that you can keep track of both for a given match. If you shake the device, it will generate a random number between 00 and 99 to simulate a die roll. And that's about it!


Nice work, Adam! And if you have any handmade pieces of **Magic** esoterica, feel free to let us know about it. There's a handy "Respond via email" link about an inch below this sentence.
