The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 4, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by *Shadows over Innistrad* previews, which have officially kicked off!


*Shadows over Innistrad* Kicks Off
==================================

This whole weekend is madness, as *Shadows over Innistrad* season kicks off with puzzles aplenty. There's a lot going on, so let me take you on a quick tour.


* Each of the three Grand Prix this weekend has an [escape room](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic/status/705590563526021120) where players on site are solving puzzles to reveal preview cards from *Shadows over Innistrad*.
* Even if you aren't at a Grand Prix, you can participate in the puzzles! On this very website, maybe even before you opened this up, you likely saw some kind of pop-up that leads you to an [Innistrad map.](http://magic.wizards.com/en/innistradmap) Solve the puzzles with the rest of the world, and more preview cards will be revealed!
* As for those preview cards? You can see them as they're revealed in [the Lab](http://magic.wizards.com/en/enterthelab), [Markov Manor](http://magic.wizards.com/en/investigatethemanor), and the [Cathedral](https://twitter.com/MtACast/status/705784115912572931) online! [More are being revealed](https://twitter.com/AffinityForBlue/status/705786130600316928) all the time!
* Or, if you want to just get to it and read the cards, [Reddit has been dutifully updating](https://www.reddit.com/r/magictcg) with preview cards as the weekend moves along.

A note to those who are curious: we're kicking things off with a bunch of official previews this weekend. We'll have a couple more on Monday when the Mechanics article goes live. After that, the full-on, every day previews start Monday, March 14 on DailyMTG and all around the web.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Rally Is Still the Best Deck—1st Place at GP Houston](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/rally-is-still-the-best-deck-1st-place-at-gp-houston/) | ChannelFireball | Owen Turtenwald

I'd often recommend reading this simply based on the fact that it's the tournament report from the No. 1-ranked player in the world, who finished first at the tournament. That's just good *Magic* readin' right there. But this one goes beyond that easy tagline and walks through Owen's process of dismissing darling of the moment [Hardened Scales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) for, well, the best deck in Standard.


1. [E037—Commanderin's Brew](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/2016/03/04/e037-commanderins-brew-commanderin-mtg-podcast.html) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Nate Burgess, and Sean Whatson

Well, I did say I could be bribed by songs about me...


It's safe to say I wildly enjoyed the first 30 seconds. It's also safe to say that if you enjoy Commander, you'll enjoy this smash-up of two Commander podcasts, as Commander's Brew joins Commanderin' to talk about Modern.


Just kidding. They talk about Commander.


1. [Hardened Scales is Deceptively Explosive](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/hardened-scales/) | Top Level Podcast | Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores

Fans of Mike and Patrick had to know this would be the topic this week. How could it be anything else? But [Hardened Scales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) isn't the only thing on the menu in this podcast, as they explore Standard and the "reinvigorated" archetypes that are driving it.


1. [MTG—The Worst *Magic: The Gathering* Cards Ever Printed—Episode 9!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96euQ1U6ll4) | The Mana Source | Wedge

Wedge spends five minutes making [Fugitive Wizard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fugitive+Wizard) and some of his best friends feel bad.

1. [How We Started an Inclusive MTG Playgroup and Rocked It](http://www.mtgdiversity.org/rocking-a-p4d-lps-chapter/) | Planeswalkers for Diversity | Leigh Fryling

In which our author visits a new store and hears the following: "The purpose of Lady Planeswalker Society matched perfectly with ours; put simply, everyone is welcome and no one is a [jerk] about it."


That's just the beginning of Leigh's journey, as she discusses how she put together a diverse, fun, and welcoming play group.


1. [Vintage 101: History on Repeat](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/vintage-101-history-on-repeat) | MTGGoldfish | Islandswamp

We've seen [Mishra's Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) decks taking over the [Vintage Super League](http://vintagesuperleague.com/), but this article explores whether that trend is a full-blown blight on the metagame—and whether history is repeating itself. Or maybe [time is just a flat circle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKRksnjSxWI).

Grand Prix Washington, D.C.—taking place next weekend, March 11–13—has become one of the most popular destinations for players looking to play in a team event with their friends. As a result, StarCityGames.com [has raised the cap](https://www.facebook.com/events/515933008581297/permalink/533230506851547/) to accommodate even more players! All you need is two friends, a hope, a dream, and transportation to our nation's capital. [You can still register online](http://gpdc.starcitygames.com/).

He's giving it away for free, people! Willy Edel, possibly the world's foremost expert on all things black and green in Modern shares his Jund list and primer via Twitter just prior to the three Modern Grand Prix. If you're already on site, you might know what you're playing, but if you're still looking for a Modern deck to battle with against the Eldrazi and Jund is an option for you, then why not look to Willy?


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Modern Bushwhacked](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/modern-constructed-league-2016-03-03)

Goblins has made its mark on virtually every non-Vintage format—except Modern. Without [Goblin Warchief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief) and [Goblin Lackey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Lackey)—possibly the two most explosively potent Goblins ever printed—Modern Goblins has mostly been left on the outside looking in.


But with the printing of [Reckless Bushwhacker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Bushwhacker), we might have finally reached a critical mass of cheap Goblins to throw at our opponents—literally. [Goblin Grenade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Grenade) is one of the most powerful burn spells ever printed, and finding a home for it is a good place to start. In this deck you often only have to get your opponent to 5, 8, or 10 life before you can simply lob [grenades](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220435) and [lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397722) at them. Raptar1 found that out by going 5-0 in the Modern League on *Magic Online*.


Will we see Goblins at one of the three Modern Grand Prix taking place this weekend? Honestly, probably not many—but certainly not zero, and maybe, just maybe, a deck like this can break through. After all, Goblins perfected attacking headlong at the opponent long before [Reality Smasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher) ever smashed its first reality.
