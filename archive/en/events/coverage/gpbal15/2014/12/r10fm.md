 It's a trend that started years ago, but does really have a starting point. Perhaps it was Jon Finkel's victory at Pro Tour Kuala Lumpur, after his induction into the Pro Tour Hall of fame. Perhaps it turned when Brian Kibler become the second member to do it at Pro Tour *Dark Ascension*. It's certainly evident in players like recent Grand Prix Orlando Top 8 player Sol Malka, or Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* Top 8 contender Jamie Parke.




 Players from across *Magic*'s history that have proven time and again that previous success is a good indicator of future potential. For Chris Pikula, going undefeated on Day 1 at Grand Prix Baltimore was just a small stepping stone: Previously, he was one of the few at the top of Pro Tour Hall of Fame ballot discussions. Narrowly missing for several years, a shift in requirements led to his name falling off the eligible list.



He wasn't as flashy with success as his friend Jon Finkel was, Pikula's tireless work at improving ethical play in the community had a profound effect at all levels in the game. While every sport contends with the issues of rule breakers, it was Pikula (among others) that rallied the campaign to change what was expected, and accepted, among the game's elite. Work on behalf of players like him is why impact on the community is part of the Hall of Fame balloting considerations.



 A returning champion rising to success is as clichéd as stories go, but it wasn't the only one at play. Local heroes are also a cliché in competitions, and it happened here too. David Foster was a local from Maryland that had attended just one Grand Prix before, and had been practicing specifically for this weekend.




 "My first big event was Grand Prix DC," Foster said. "I've been waiting for a year for a local Limited event like this. It's the favorite format for me." How he prepared was an echo heard often. "I've been playing a lot of *Magic Online*."




 For his second Grand Prix, going undefeated through to Day 2 was an almost unbelievable feat. The skill and intensity was elevated. "It's my first professional REL," Foster said, referring to the strictest Rules Enforcement Level in force for the Day 2 competitors. "I'm trying really hard not to make any mistakes."




 If he made any he'd know about it. A small troupe had gathered just for Foster's match. Friends? "These guys," he said, waving to a small contingent that had been watching his match from the gallery, "from my school and local card shop. I drove some of them up here this morning."




 It wasn't quite fighting for a hometown win, but for Foster and friends it felt just like it.




**The Decks**




 Pikula's deck was, at a glace, average. With several morphs and powerful uncommons like [Scion of Glaciers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+Glaciers) and [Riverwheel Aerialists](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riverwheel+Aerialists), Pikula could use his pressure to turn cards like [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) and [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke) into the tempo he needed to stay ahead.




 Foster's deck was certainly colorful. With the ability to cast everything from [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom), [Abzan Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Guide), [Flying Crane Technique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Crane+Technique) and even [High Sentinels of Arashin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Sentinels+of+Arashin), Foster relied on his powerful three-color-producing lands to power out the best his deck – and the format – could offer.




**The Games**




 The first game was a back-and-forth affair on mana. Foster had access to four colors by his second turn, and cast Archer's [Parapet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parapet) to put up a shield. Pikula, with [Bloodfire Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodfire+Mentor), did the same on the following turn. However, they both stumbled on three mana, building out an array of morphs beside their blockers.




 "This is weird," Foster said.



"The Wall versus morph game," Pikula summed, though it was about to move on from that.



[Crippling Chill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Chill) at the end of Foster's turn was Pikula's attempt to dig into a land. He whiffled, but added [Scion of Glaciers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+Glaciers) to his side. It looked small after Foster played [Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinel)s of High Arashin. The beefy fliers went to work attacking, but Pikula moved to race back. Attacking with his Scion, turning on [Mardu Heart-Piercer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Heart-Piercer) and more, he worked to break through the blockade Foster has set on the ground.




 There were six cards in Foster's hand, compared to just four mana in play for Pikula when he went all-in. [Force Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Away) bounced the [Abzan Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Guide) Foster unmorphed while blocking, leaving him with just his [Parapet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parapet) and [Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinel)s to Pikula's six creatures, [Leaping Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaping+Master) being the last to join.






*Chris Pikula worked hard to get ahead of David Foster in every game.*
