Before we move into the story for *Eldritch Moon* (starting soon!), let's take a moment to reflect on the story of *Shadows over Innistrad*.


Done?


Good. Now that you're done reflecting, you might as well make sure you're all caught up on the story so far with our handy e-book collection below, filled with all the stories from *Shadows over Innistrad*.


The files below are in ePUB and mobi formats and require a compatible e-reader.


Enjoy!
