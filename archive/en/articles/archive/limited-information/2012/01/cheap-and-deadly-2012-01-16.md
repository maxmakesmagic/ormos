[Silent Departure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure) and [Prey Upon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon) are two of the best commons in *Innistrad*. Why are these spells so good? Well, there are a lot of little reasons that contribute to the value of these cards. But at the end of the day, they're so impressive because they allow you to generate a real advantage on the board without hindering your development.

If [Prey Upon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon) cost two or three mana to cast its value would diminish significantly, and the same goes for [Silent Departure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure). Would [Prey Upon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon) still be a playable card if it cost an additional mana, or two, to cast?

Sure! In fact, this happens time and time again when people splash [Prey Upon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon) off of little more than two [Shimmering Grotto](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimmering+Grotto)s for green sources. But that doesn't mean you'd go out of your way to draft them, or add them to your deck, in the way that you should for the version of [Prey Upon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon) that requires only a single [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) to be cast.

My preview card for today is a new cheap spell that promises to have a big impact on *Dark Ascension–Innistrad* limited.

Ready to see what's so alluring?

Using Deadly Allure Effectively
Unlike some of the flashiest *Dark Ascension* cards, like Sorin, Lord of Innistrad, that have been previewed so far (and are now viewable in the [*Dark Ascension* Card Image Gallery](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/darkascension/cig#)), Deadly Allure isn't the kind of card you should be looking to build decks around—Constructed or Limited. Even though Deadly Allure isn't going to influence peoples' deck building decisions that radically, it's sure to have a big impact on *Dark Ascension* Limited matches for months to come.

But in order to make the most out of Deadly Allure (and to mitigate its effectiveness when it's played against you) you're going to need to figure out the best ways to use it and when you need to leave it in your sideboard.

So when is Deadly Allure at its best?

Deadly Allure is obviously very good when you are already ahead, and your opponent is trying to catch up.

If you are ahead on the board with a bunch of ground creatures, then Deadly Allure gives you a great way to press your advantage. So if you can get off to an aggressive start with a bunch of Zombies, then back it up with a Deadly Allure (and maybe a [Ghoulcaller's Chant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghoulcaller%27s+Chant) or a [Ghoulraiser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghoulraiser) to get your creature back) you should be able to pick up quite a few wins before your opponents are even able to get their own games started.

If you have a big creature, you can use Deadly Allure to eat one of your opponent's little creatures. Alternatively, if you have a little and largely irrelevant creature, you can use Deadly Allure to "trade up" for whatever creature your opponent has on defense.
