The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 16, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [fishermen](#fishermen).


Today's Previews
================


Every day during preview season, you can look to this section for any previews you might have missed, as we'll keep it updated with anything previewed not on DailyMTG.


1. [Wolf of Devil's Breach](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4aednf/soi_wolf_of_devils_breach/) and [Groundskeeper](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4amxcc/soi_groundskeeper/)

Officially previewed in China, you can check out translations of these cards on the Reddit threads linked above—though Groundskeeper is a reprint (and my favorite reprint in the set).


1. [Breakneck Rider/Neck Breaker](http://grandprixcostarica.com/) | Grand Prix Costa Rica Event Page

The page is in Spanish, but the card isn't!


1. [Sigarda, Heron's Grace](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32590_Exclusive-Shadows-Over-Innistrad-Preview-Card.html) | StarCityGames | Mike Sigrist

Siggy previews Siga. Nice. At any rate, check out the latest Angel to grace Innistrad's skies. Is this one friend or foe?


1. [Epiphany at the Drownyard](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/epiphany-at-the-drownyard/) | Top Level Podcast | Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores

It's blue, it's sort of like Fact or Fiction—of course Patrick and Mike previewed it!

Grand Prix D.C. Finals Match and Draft
======================================


1. While we didn't have live video coverage of this weekend, we did actually record the finals draft and match, and those videos are now [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/wizardsmtg/videos?view=0&shelf_id=5&sort=dd) for your viewing pleasure. Enjoy!

After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Vintage Super League Season 4 Finals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4QE4n7luv8&list=PL3rP64NRtmbgwJwCLu5tySKSc2waMVypB&index=85)

Luis Scott-Vargas and David Ochoa squared off in the finals of [Vintage Super League](http://vintagesuperleague.com/) last night, and the results were—well, that would be giving it away, wouldn't it? Especially when there is a whole bunch of *Magic* to be watched by following that link above? Seems silly for me to spoil it here.


1. [Looking Ahead](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13168&writer=Ali+Aintrazi&articledate=3-16-2016) | TCGPlayer | Ali Aintrazi

Of all the "What cards get better/get worse/rotate out" articles we've seen lately, what I like about this one is that it gives you, among other things, a list of cards to keep an eye on that are pretty brew-tastic (as we would expect from Ali), as well as a few decks that remain mostly intact, possibly giving you a bit of a jump-start on the new format.


And if you want more of this sort of thing, [ChannelFireball posted pre-rotation power rankings](http://www.channelfireball.com/power-rankings/) just yesterday for non-rotating cards.


1. [Archangel Avacyn in Black/White Aggro](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/archangel-avacyn-in-blackwhite-aggro/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Frank Karsten, as usual, is on the ball, already churning out a possible decklist to take advantage of Archangel Avacyn in the new Standard. It combines the natural marriage of a planeswalker from the Gatewatch, an Eldrazi, and an Angel created to protect Innistrad! Because of course!


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [[SOI] Hilarious Translation Mistake](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4aj3mh/soi_hilarious_translation_mistake/)

Well, this is a touch embarrassing. Hilariously so. We're looking into how this happened. Between stifled giggles.


But there are actual implications for this in tournaments. I spoke with Scott Larabee, premier play programs manager, about how cards like this are treated in tournaments, and he pointed me toward section 3.6 of the [official tournament rules](http://www.wizards.com/contentresources/wizards/wpn/main/documents/magic_the_gathering_tournament_rules_pdf1.pdf).


***3.6 Card Interpretation***


*The official text of any card is the Oracle text corresponding to the name of the card. Players have the right to request access to the official wording of a card only if they can uniquely identify that card, although the card does not necessarily have to be identified by name. That request will be honored if logistically possible. Identifying a double-faced or flip card by either name on it is acceptable, as long as the ability that requires the name does not refer to an object on the battlefield.*


*Players may not use errors or omissions in Oracle to abuse the rules. The Head Judge is the final authority for card interpretations, and he or she may overrule Oracle if an error is discovered.*


So, in other words, for anything tournament-related, English is the language that matters, and the card, officially, is called Descend upon the Sinful.


Now, if you want to call it Wrath of Cod among your friends, well, by all means, do what you must.


Top 25
======


1. Teamwork!

The results from the team-centered Grand Prix Washington, D.C., are in, and some individuals came out looking pretty good.


First up is William Jensen, who went from unranked to 21st, thanks to his Top 4 finish alongside fellow Peach Garden Oathers Owen Turtenwald (No. 1) and Reid Duke (No. 6). They certainly were the highest-ranked trio coming into the weekend, and Jensen's ascension only underscores that fact.


Next up is Jacob Wilson, who also finished in the Top 4, teamed with Matt Nass and Sam Pardee. Wilson is up a whopping five spots to No. 15.


Finally, the trio of No. 5 Martin Müller, No. 16 Joel Larsson, and No. 18 Martin Dang teamed up to finish with 33 points, just outside the Top 8. That garnered enough Pro Points for each of them to rise three to five spots and to push Müller, the wunderkind who is on the short list of the game's best rising stars, into the Top 5 for the first time. Leaping Reitzl, Manfield, and Damo da Rosa would be a stretch (and Turtenwald a virtual impossibility), but Müller is rising faster than just about anyone in the game.

Deck of the Day
===============


1. [All-In Sneak Moon](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/legacy-constructed-league-2016-03-14)

Back in the day, there was a deck called All-In Red that used a series of ritual effects—[Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame), etc.—to put something difficult to beat on the battlefield quickly. It was called All-In Red because it would often use its entire hand, or pretty close, to put out this one, deadly threat, and just kind of hope it got there. Opponent has an answer? Whoops, I was all-in on that threat.


Today's deck is kind of like that, but a hybrid with that concept, [Sneak Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack), and various [Blood Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) strategies (to be fair, All-In Red occasionally adopted [Blood Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) and [Magus of the Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon) as well). Here, the fast mana is [Lotus Petal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal), [Simian Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide), [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), [Sandstone Needle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandstone+Needle), and [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors). The payoffs include [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan), yes, but also [Sneak Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack) and [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) to get [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) or [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) on the battlefield. When it's one of *those* threats decks must answer, the deck is a little less all-in.


And the strategy worked for Deadwing, who went 5-0 in a recent [Legacy League](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/legacy-constructed-league-2016-03-14). [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) seems like a bit of beast against this deck, but, then again, [Blood Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) seems like kind of a beating against most [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) decks. Heck, against most decks, period.
