R*ise of the Eldrazi* has a token or two. For example, there's this Elemental:

But that's not nearly as important as the Eldrazi Spawn!

Then there's the Hellion token.:

But don't forget about the Eldrazi Spawn, which are key to understanding the format!

We've already seen Gelatinous Genesis, which creates these Ooze tokens:

But there's a third Eldrazi Spawn, which should help you with your quest to gather enough tokens to accelerate into the big guns!

There's actually a final token, but we're not going to show it to you today. Next week's Savor the Flavor will have a delightful surprise for you!
