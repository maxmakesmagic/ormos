Man, is this taking forever to write. You see, this is where the right brain and left brain get into fights. You see, the right brain comes up with all this [wacky](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/mr110.asp), creative stuff and the hard working left brain has to do all the work. Stupid right brain.


To give you some idea, a normal “Making **Magic**” takes me one to three hours to write. This column has already taken ten plus hours and I'm a ways from being done. Luckily, I was off on paternity leave for most of it and my babies have to sleep sometime. (Although not as long as one would hope.)


That said, I do enjoy doing these occasional “[out of the box](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-box)” articles. I'm very curious to get feedback on what you think of this column. Did you like it? Did you get it? How crazy do I seem?


Inquiring minds want to know.
