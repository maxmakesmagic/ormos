Although *Conspiracy* takes place on Fiora, not all of the art in the *Conspiracy* set was limited to that plane. An obvious example would be the new art for [Rout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rout).

**Q:** What plane does this art take place on?


* Mirrodin - Right! This is during the war before Mirrodin succumbs to become New Phyrexia.
* New Phyrexia - Wrong!
* Innistrad - Wrong!


All right, I got a little sneaky with the "easy" one, sorry about that. Now onto a few other arts to show:

That one is actually not a new commission; it was first used in *Deul Decks: Sorin vs. Tibalt*, and as such was commissioned without a specific setting so that it is easier to be reused.


How about that awesome artâ€”pretty amazing right? Major kudos to the artists and our creative team responsible for producing such amazing pieces.
