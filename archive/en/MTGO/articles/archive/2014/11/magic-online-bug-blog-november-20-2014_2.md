What Is the *Magic Online* Bug Blog?
![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/icon_bugblog.jpg)
While the [Known Issues List](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-known-issues) is simply that—a running list of issues we expect players to encounter most often—this accompanying “Bug Blog” is the list’s companion. Here you’ll find updates regarding emergent new issues, details around issue statuses when applicable, known issue workarounds, and a running tally of Known Issues List updates. The Bug Blog will be updated each Thursday, in conjunction with the [Known Issues List](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-known-issues) on the same day.

Known Issues List Updates
This week, several Server and Game Play known issues have been scheduled for the *Magic Online* update on Wednesday, December 3. In addition to this, there was a fixed issue that was accidentally not added when it was fixed during the November 5 deployment. Updates can be found in the tables below.


**Newly Scheduled for the Wednesday, December 3 *Magic Online* Client Update**


**Game Play**



* C14 | Artifact creature tokens created by C14 cards show no art when zoomed or in the preview pane

* C14 | [Song of the Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Song+of+the+Dryad) enchanting another Aura appears incorrectly. The card functions correctly.

* General | [Cruel Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum)'s resolution can crash the game, causing it to restart
* General | Lands in M15 frames that produce mana of two differnet colors have the wrong background colors in the rules text box

Temporary Workarounds for Known Issues
We're hard at work on whittling down the Known Issues List. In the meantime, we've found temporary solutions that may help alleviate certain problems that players are experiencing. Refer to the table below to see if there is a suggested temporary workaround for an issue that you are experiencing.




|  |
| --- |
| **Server** |
| **Issue Description** | **Temporary Workaround** |
| Duel Scene | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out | If you suspect this is happening to you, logging out and back in may resolve the problem |
| **Client** |
| **Issue Description** | **Temporary Workaround** |
| Collection | Dragging or adding a large number of cards to a deck or trade binder causes *Magic Online* to freeze while processing, resulting in a "Main Navigation is Not Responding" error | While the client is not responsive, waiting several minutes will allow the process to complete. Using the error dialog to close the client will cancel the transaction. |
| Collection | Sorting columns in list view prevents quantity from being displayed correctly | Changing to card view will show correct quantities |
| Duel Scene | Land can visually appear tapped at the start of a turn if a player unmorphs a creature during their opponent's end step | The issue is visual only and clicking the tapped lands will add mana to the mana pool correctly |
| Duel Scene | The window for [Thoughtsieze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtsieze) (and other spells or effects that allow selection from a subset of revealed cards) is not sized correctly to show all cards | Scrolling, resizing the window, or checking the game log will allow players to see all the cards revealed |
| Events | Occasionally cards can become visually duplicated in your sideboard and prevent deck submission | Restarting the client should fix the issue |
| General | Players can experience memory leaks in some situations | Restarting the client can temporarily resolve these issues |
| Store | Updating billing and shipping information during the checkout process can have inconsistent results | Players who update from the Account Settings page should not have issues |
