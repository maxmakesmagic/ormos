WHAT IS THE MAGIC ONLINE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES?
---------------------------------------------

The *Magic: The Gathering Online* Championship Series, also known as MOCS, is a monthly series of events, broken into twelve seasons, in which players can earn promo cards. Top players can also earn an invitation to the annual in-person *Magic Online* Championship event, as well as a Pro Tour event.


Each MOCS season is either four or five weeks long. Throughout each season, players earn Qualifier Points (QPs) by playing in events that award QPs as part of their prize structure. At the end of each season, players may enter MOCS Preliminaries and Finals if they have earned enough QPs to qualify:


* Players who earn **15 or more QPs** qualify for the Season Preliminaries where they can play for a chance to earn enough QPs to enter the Finals.
* Players who earn **35 or more QPs** can bypass the Preliminaries and enter the Season Finals directly.

The winners of each Season Finals will earn an invitation to participate in the *Magic Online*  Championship and the opportunity to compete at the Pro Tour corresponding to their season win.


The sixteen 2014 *Magic Online*  Championship finalists will be comprised of:



* [The defending 2013 *Magic Online*  champion](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/03312014/mocchamp)
* Twelve individual *Magic Online*  Championship Series season winners
* The MOCS Player-of-the-Year Championship winner
* Two MOCS Last Chance Qualifier winners

HOW TO EARN MOCS PROMO CARDS
----------------------------



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
The *Magic Online*  Championship Series (MOCS) is a fun, competitive way to play tournament-style *Magic Online*—it's also a great way to earn awesome promo cards!
  

 You can earn special promo cards through the *Magic Online*  Championship Series. Promo cards are updated monthly for each MOCS Season.
  

 To get a MOCS Season promo card, you must earn at least 15 Qualifier Points during a MOCS regular season. You can earn additional promo cards, as well as premium promo cards, by placing high in Preliminaries and Finals.
  

 Remember that QPs do not transfer from one season to another.

MAGIC ONLINE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------

The 2014 *Magic Online*  Championship Series will use the following structure: 


* Seasons: The 2014 *Magic Online*  Championship Series will be divided into twelve (12) separate seasons. Each season's duration is four (4) or five (5) weeks. Each season's start and end date are listed in the schedule below. Each MOCS season begins after the scheduled maintenance on its Start Date and ends at the beginning of the scheduled maintenance on its End Date. If for any reason there is no scheduled maintenance on those dates, the start and stop time will be 8:00 AM PST (or PDT when appropriate).
* Qualifier Points: During each season, a number of *Magic Online*  events will offer the opportunity to earn Qualifier Points (QPs). These MOCS qualifying events are restricted to scheduled events and queues that have successfully completed and include Qualifier Points (QPs) listed as part of their prize structure. The number of Qualifier Points (QPs) offered will vary by event. Points earned in a season do not carry over to any other season. See the table below for more information about Qualifier Points (QPs).
* Earning Qualifier Points (QPs): At the end of each specified tournament, all participants may earn Qualifier Points (QPs) based upon their final rank or match wins in the tournament. Qualifier Points (QPs) earned in any given season are season specific and cannot be used to join another season's Preliminaries or Finals.
* Season Preliminaries: At the end of each season, *Magic Online*  will offer up to six (6) Season Preliminaries. All eligible players who have earned sufficient QPs may join and participate in any of the corresponding Season Preliminaries. Players who finish with enough Match Wins will earn enough QPs to join the corresponding Season Finals.
* Season Finals: At the end of each season, after all of the Season Preliminaries have completed, all eligible players who have earned sufficient QPs may join and participate in the corresponding Season Finals. The winner of each Season Finals will earn an invitation to participate in the 2014 *Magic Online*  Championship to be held in 2015 and an invitation to participate in the Pro Tour indicated in the schedule. (See 2014 *Magic Online*  Championship Series Schedule below).
* Player of the Year: Wizards of the Coast will track the cumulative Qualifier Points (QPs) of each player and maintain the Player of the Year leaderboards: Constructed and Limited. After the end of the twelfth season, players who are ranked in the top 150 of each leaderboard will be invited to play in the 2014 *Magic Online*  Player of the Year Championship tournament held on December 13, 2014. The winner of the Player of the Year Championship will be invited to participate in the 2014 *Magic Online*  Championship and an invitation to participate in the Pro Tour indicated in the schedule. (See 2014 *Magic Online*  Championship Series Schedule below).
* Last Chance Qualifiers:  *Magic Online*  will host two 2014 *Magic Online*  Championship Series Last Chance Qualifier tournaments (MOCS LCQ) on December 20, 2014 and December 27, 2014. These tournaments will be open to all eligible players not already invited to the 2014 *Magic Online*  Championship. The winner of each MOCS LCQ will be invited to participate in the 2014 *Magic Online*  Championship to be held in 2015 and an invitation to participate in the Pro Tour indicated in the schedule. (See 2014 *Magic Online*  Championship Series Schedule below).

 Different tournaments or formats may be called out and offer increased or reduced amounts of QPs each season. This adjusted QP schedule will be announced a minimum of one week prior to the start of a season.
  

 In addition, Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to add/remove qualifying formats, alter events that award Qualifier Points (QPs), and/or adjust the number of QPs offered by any event with a minimum of 24 hours notice.
  

 **Note:** Some tournaments that are part of the MOCS (such as Season Finals) do not award QPs.
 |  |

 
 









SEASON PRELIMINARIES AND SEASON FINALS PARTICIPATION
----------------------------------------------------


The Season Preliminaries and Season Finals are open only to players who earned sufficient Qualifier Points in the appropriate season. Players must use fifteen (15) QPs to join the Season Preliminaries. Players must use thirty-five (35) QPs to join the Season Finals.


All players who qualify for the Season Preliminaries or Season Finals will automatically receive a copy of that season's promo card awarded to their qualifying account during the scheduled maintenance period prior to the Season Preliminaries. If for any reason there is no scheduled maintenance on that date, the promo card will be awarded during the next scheduled maintenance period.


Qualifier Points are season-specific and can only be used for the season in which they are earned. QPs earned in previous season cannot be used to enter later Season Preliminaries or Season Finals. Qualifier Points are not tradable and are for the sole use of the player who has earned them. Unused QPs in each player's collection will be removed at the conclusion of each MOCS Season.


It is the player's responsibility to verify that they have the correct number of QPs required to enter and join the Season Preliminaries and/or Season Finals PRIOR to its start time. If a player believes he or she should be qualified and is unable to join the Season Preliminaries or Season Finals, they will need to contact customer service prior to the start of the event.

 | 
The 16 MOCS finalists will compete in person for the *Magic Online*  Championship and their share of over $100,000 USD in 2015. Full details will be announced later in 2014.
  

 The winner of each *Magic Online* Championship is immediately advanced to Gold level for the remainder of the current season and the entirety of the following season (as if that player had reached the minimum number of Professional Points at that *Magic Online*  Championship to be promoted to Gold level).
  

 Players must have a signed waiver and consent form to compete in the 2014 *Magic Online*  Championship. Forms can be downloaded from the *Magic: The Gathering*  Pro Tour page and will be available onsite.
  

 **Minors must have a parent or guardian's signature on these forms. Minors will not be able to register or play unless we receive a waiver signed by a parent or guardian. No exceptions!**
  

 Bring these forms with you to registration. We will make forms available for competitors at registration, if necessary.
  

 To register, all participants must present one of the following forms of identification:
  

 * a driver's license, or
* a passport, or
* a copy of a birth certificate and photo IDs (school IDs are acceptable).


  

 Determination of the eligibility of a person under age 18 to participate in the 2014 *Magic Online*  Championship Series is based on the permission granted to said person by his/her parent or legal guardian.
  

 All prizes are awarded "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, express or implied, (including, without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose). This is a contest of skill and, therefore, there are no odds of winning as is the case with a game of chance. All applicable taxes, fees, duties, tariffs, passport or visa costs, and any license, destination, entry, exit and/or delivery charges are the sole responsibility of each player. Taxes on the prizes (including, without limitation, income taxes), if any, are the sole responsibility of the player winners.
