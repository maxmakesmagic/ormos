### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This is a green card and should show a jedi in the shape of a centaur made of tree bark. See reference." As [Mark Rosewater has discussed](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mr20), the incarnations were called "Jedi" during design.

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Mark. 

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final piece. 

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today.
