In the heat of all this **Magic**, surrounded by Legacy and Commander and **Magic** Online computers, it's easy to forget that we're in the middle of the largest gaming convention in the country! Easy that is, until you're, say, covering the Legacy tournament and you're following newly Vintage Championship Runner-Up Paul Mastriano. Then he sits down to meet his next round opponent and it's [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). No, not the card. Literally, [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). Look.

David McDarby, from Knoxville, TN was qualified for Nationals on rating, did average on the first day, then suited up for the rest of the weekend. He made this awesome costume himself, with some help on the tough stitching of the hood. He said this was his fourth GenCon and he plans to keep coming for a long time. And with a costume as awesome as that, I sure hope so.


Sadly, Mastriano did beat him in that round, disproving the myth that it's impossible in Legacy to beat a resolved Jace. Speaking of, you can see him smiling in the background of the photo. It's cute.


So I walk away from that match-up and run directly into this:

He turned around to see what my deal was, and here he is.

This is David O'Brien. He came all the way from Greenville, North Carolina. I had to run after I saw him but I asked how to catch up with him later. He said, "Don't worry, I'll be here all weekend." No doubt.


I'm sorry, but that chain-mailed dragon slays me every time.


So remember everyone at home, yes there's tons of **Magic**, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.
