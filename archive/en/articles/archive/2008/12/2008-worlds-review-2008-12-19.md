T he 2008 **Magic** season came to a close at the [2008 World Championships](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/japanese-coverage-2008-magic-world-championships-2008-12-11) last weekend in Memphis, Tennessee, but that doesn't mean the analysis is over. The individual portion of Worlds showcased both Standard and Extended. Did Elves! continue its dominace from Pro Tour–Berlin? Is Faeries still the top dog in Standard? Paul Jordan crunched the numbers for all the major deck archetypes. If you're looking for the hard numbers on what beat what, you won't want to miss it.
