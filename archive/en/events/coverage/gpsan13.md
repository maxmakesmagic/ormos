GRAND PRIX SANTIAGO 2013
------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsnt13/trophy.jpg)Just one year ago, Luis Navas was learning how to play **Magic**. Today, with his countrymen cheering and shouting and calling out his name, he can call himself a Grand Prix Champion.


There was so much at stake for Navas that one has to wonder if he was too new to the high-level tournament scene—it was his first Grand Prix ever—to even feel the pressure. First he was playing for a Top 8 berth at his first major tournament. Then he was playing for an invite to the Pro Tour. By the end, he was playing for the national pride of his fellow Chileans.


And there he was, holding the trophy on home soil as the watching crowd erupted. Players talked all weekend about the pride of winning a South American Grand Prix, and Chilean players especially emphasized keeping the trophy at home after losing it in 2011. And out of everyone, Navas, a relative rookie, was the one to hoist it at the end.


His aggressive Rakdos Deck certainly exploited a metagame heavy with Devotion and Esper control, running through a Top 8 with three Mono Blue decks, several control builds, and more than a few Polukranos.


But Navas's triumph wasn't the only story. Jonathan Melamed added to his sterling resume, as did several former National Team members, such as Brazilian Carlos Davi Montenegro and Argentinians Luis Salvatto and Nicolas de Nicola


Still, the day belongs to Chile and Luis Navas, Champion of Grand Prix Santiago 2013!
