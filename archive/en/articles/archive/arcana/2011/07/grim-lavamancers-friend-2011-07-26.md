Come with us now into the distant past of **Magic** Arcana! All the way back to [January 25, 2002](/en/articles/archive/lavamancers-buddy-2002-01-25)! We're going to paraphrase that Arcana (the seventeenth one ever) and then tie it in to the modern day. It'll be fun!


### The Backstory


When the *Odyssey* flavor text was being written, one of the writers came up with a character named "Matoc, lavamancer."

The creative team loved the idea of a lavamancer and looked around to find a card that could embody this concept. But none of the available art seemed to fit. Finally, they decided to use a card that could plausibly claim to depict a lavamancer.

A familiar's got to have a master, right? And the art for [Obstinate Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Familiar) has a hooded wizard in it, so that was picked to be the lavamancer. In the next set, *Torment*, the creative team commissioned some art to be the lavamancer. And they made sure to include the familiar to remind people who it was. Essentially, they moved the camera around to the other side of [Obstinate Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Familiar).

### Modern Day


The original Arcana on this topic says, "[T]he Lavamancer never goes anywhere without his familiar." So when new art was commissioned for [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer)'s appearance as a judge promo, the creative team made sure to include that detail. The card later appeared with the new art in *Premium Deck Series: Fire & Lightning*:

See? The lavamancer really doesn't go anywhere without his familiar!


Anyway, that's the art that was used for the ***Magic** 2012* version. That's the point of all this.
