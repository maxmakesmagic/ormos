Two Qualifier Weekends in October
=================================


We have two [Qualifier Weekends](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend) coming up in October:


* October 9–10
* October 30–31\*

The entry window for Day 1 and Day 2 of events is from 6–8 a.m. PT.


\*Note: for those in Europe, the October 31 Day 2 event will start one hour earlier, 14:00–16:00 CEST, because of the end of Daylight Savings (this only applies to Europe).


September Ranked Season badges will update after the October 9–10 Qualifier Weekend—if you qualified for the October 30-31 Qualifier Weekends, you will not see your badge for this event until after the October 9–10 qualifier weekend.


*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Quick Draft Starts Friday!
=====================================================


Quick Drafts let you draft at your own pace, fast or slow. Like to draft without the pressure of timers—particularly with a new set that you may not be completely familiar with yet? Or maybe you know the set backwards and forwards and want to blast through drafting without waiting for others?


Whichever is your preference, queue up this Friday for the *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Quick Draft and draft against *MTG Arena* bots who don't mind either way!


When you're done, take your deck and play games against real-life Quick Draft players!


#FindYourChampion, Play Their Decks, Win Prizes!
================================================


The epic [*Magic* World Championship XXVII](https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxvii) showdown is coming next weekend, October 8–10, on *MTG Arena*, and you can join in to win prizes by picking one of the 16 top players from across the 2020–21 season as your champion, and then following live coverage on <https://twitch.tv/magic>.


Here's how it works:


1. Go to <https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxvii>.
2. Select your champion from among the top 16 players and register your choice.
3. [Follow the competition](https://twitch.tv/magic) to see how your champion performs.
4. Play in Best-of-One matches with the champions' Standard decks!

Depending on how your chosen champion places, you could win these prizes:


* **1st place**: *Magic* World Championship trophy pet and sleeve, plus six rare individual card rewards (ICRs)
* **2nd place**: *Magic* World Championship sleeve and four rare ICRs
* **3rd–4th place**: *Magic* World Championship sleeve and two rare ICRs
* **5th–16th place**: *Magic* Championship sleeve and one rare ICR

Compete with Champion Standard Decks
------------------------------------


The fun doesn't end there—October 8–11 brings the *Magic* World Championship XXVII Showcase event, where you can play Best-of-One matches in *MTG Arena* against other players using a Standard deck of one of the champions—and even be represented by their avatar!

Play as much as you like and change decks as often as you like. Your first and second wins each earn you 1,000 XP, and your third win scores you a Trophy sleeve!
