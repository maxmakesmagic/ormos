You've seen *Dominaria* previews. You've seen some amazing art, astounding Sagas, and awe-inspiring lore dripping from the set.


And today, we're going to highlight all the playmats you'll see featuring *Dominaria* for the next couple of weeks at Grand Prix and the Pro Tour!


But first . . .


Dominaria GP T-Shirt
====================


As with all new set releases, the Grand Prix prize walls will feature a new T-shirt themed to *Dominaria*. This one will feature some sweet new art on a heather gray shirt. Here's a little sample of what that design is!

Bologna and Columbus
====================


The first Grand Prix weekend to feature *Dominaria* doesn't showcase one playmat, but three!

The playmats feature [Slimefoot, the Stowaway](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slimefoot%2C+the+Stowaway) (art by [Alex Konstad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5b%22Alex%20Konstad%22%5d)); [Tiana, Ship's Caretaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tiana%2C+Ship%27s+Caretaker) (art by [Eric Deschamps](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5b%22Eric%20Deschamps%22%5d)); and [Weatherlight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weatherlight) (art by [Jaime Jones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5b%22Jaime%20Jones%22%5d)).
