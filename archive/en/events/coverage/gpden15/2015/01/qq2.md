In this Standard, just about everything is playable. But sometimes "just about" isn't enough. With the influx of cards set to alter the landscape in Fate Reforged, what archetypes and cards are players hoping will get just a little better—and with some hope will grace the top tables with more regularity?

***Matt Sperling:** Ajani's Pridemate. It's almost good enough. There are gain lands, and [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). It can be a good early drop.*

***Paul Rietzl:** Something that helps the two-color Gods. [Ephara, God of the Polis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephara%2C+God+of+the+Polis) was good for like, two weeks. I think it can be a really player. So can [Xenagos, God of Revels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+God+of+Revels).*
