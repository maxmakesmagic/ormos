It's time to look at more playtest cards! This will be a lot like the [last time we did it](/en/articles/archive/playtest-card-roundup-2010-11-30), except with different cards. Because it would be weird to do the same cards again, wouldn't it?

This card from *Coldsnap* doesn't appear to have a lot to do with [Goblin Piledriver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver), but it's a pretty funny name. After a tweak to the upkeep cost, it ended up as [Jötun Grunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=J%C3%B6tun+Grunt), which is also a pretty funny name in its own right.

That card is accurately named. That world *does* suck.

This appears to be an attempt to translate [Rocket-Powered Turbo Slug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rocket-Powered+Turbo+Slug) into regular **Magic** without using "super haste" on the card. Although "CARDNAME deals 20 damage to you" sounds nicer than the language used for [Pacts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?name=+%5Bpact%5D&set=%5B%22Future%20Sight%22%5D), it does have the drawback that if the Kobold dies before its controller's next upkeep, it deals the 20 damage right away. The Pacts were probably a better angle.

This is a straightforward card, but for some reason the only thing I can see on it is the extra "e" in the name of the set. It should be *Judgment*. The card ended up as [Venomous Vines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venomous+Vines).

This card didn't show up in *Shadowmoor*, although the concept of non-basic lands with the basic land types did. So this was probably a predecessor of [Moonring Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonring+Island).

Okay, there's nothing that interesting about this one. But it's called "Arcana," so it seems obligatory to include it here.
