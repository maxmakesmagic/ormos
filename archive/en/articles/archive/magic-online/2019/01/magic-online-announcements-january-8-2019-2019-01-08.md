Vintage Cube Runs through Jan. 17
---------------------------------


Before *Ravnica Allegiance* hits MTGO, there's still plenty of fun to be had in Vintage Cube! It's nothing like any other cube out there, and it's overflowing with iconic cards from *Magic*'s entire 25-year history. Draft the super-deck of your dreams while you still can!


Players have through January 17 to try it out. See the full card list and the most recent changes [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist).

UMA Draft Events End Jan. 11

There are only a few days left to catch the *Ultimate Masters* action! Phantom events will continue until January 11 to allow players practice time for MagicFest Prague.

Saturday MCQ Finals
