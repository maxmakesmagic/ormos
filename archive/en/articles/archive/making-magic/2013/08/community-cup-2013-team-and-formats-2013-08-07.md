Community Cup 2013 Team and Formats
===================================



 Posted in [Making Magic](/en/articles/columns/making-magic)
 on August 7, 2013

By Sean Gibbons




Born in a dimension of pure cake, Sean Gibbons was quickly sent into exile after leading a rebellion opposing The Great Margarine Edict. Arriving on Earth, he saved a school bus full of Mulldrifters from being evoked and was instantly adopted by Wizards of the Coast to serve as their associate community manager. Those Mulldrifters later died to removal. 







If you watched the second day of the  [2013 **Magic** World Championship](/en/events/coverage/youth-served-flash)  or pay any attention to the Internet, you may have caught the announcement of the 2013 **Magic Online** Community Cup team. If you missed the announcement or want to learn more about the community team, I have good news for you! Here's an in-depth look at the competitors who will be flown to Seattle during PAX Prime and put to the ultimate test versus the Wizards Team.


Dozens of players were nominated by the community to participate in this year's  [**Magic Online** Community Cup](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/community-cup-2013-announcement-2013-06-14)  at PAX. From all the potentials, the following individuals have been selected by Wizards of the Coast to represent the community. Many of you will recognize the faces you see below, but I've interrogated all of them just in case you don't!


### Melissa DeTora

I'm a Gold pro and writer for [TCGPlayer.com](http://www.tcgplayer.com/). I love competitive magic and go to almost every North American Grand Prix. My goal this year is to earn enough Pro Points to get Platinum status. I am also a level 2 judge and judge a lot of local events and am very involved in growing my local community.


**What format do you enjoy playing the most?**


Booster Draft


**When did you start playing **Magic**?** 


1997


**Which Planeswalker do you relate to best?**


Hard question, because I don't really pay much attention to **Magic** flavor or the storyline. But I'll say [Elspeth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant). She's one of my favorite Planeswalkers (besides [Jace: TMS](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), of course) and she seems like a good person.


**If you were a Planeswalker (aren't we all?), what would your "ultimate" ability be?**


Destroy all creatures. Put a 1/1 flying Spirit on the battlefield for each creature destroyed this way.


**If you could visit any plane in the Multiverse, where would you go?**


Dominaria. It's old school and brings me back to when I first started playing.


**What's your favorite **Magic** card?** 


[Argothian Enchantress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argothian+Enchantress). My first successful competitive deck was an Enchantress deck and I qualified for my first Nationals in 2000 with it. It's still one of my favorite decks to this day.



![Argothian Enchantress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Argothian+Enchantress)

**If you win the 2013 Community Cup (you won't), what song will be playing in your head as you hoist the prestigious Hammy Cup? Feel free to skip to the next question.**


It's obvious by my twitter handle: "All I do is Win" by DJ Khaled.


**After you're defeated in the 2013 Community Cup, your dazed and defeated self will be hauled away in a squeaky wheelbarrow. Unable to blink or move, the bright lights of the Seattle Convention Center will flash before your eyes as you're removed from the premises. Hang tight, there's a question coming. Amid the gleeful and music-like laughter of the Wizards Team celebrating their fresh victory and the embarrassed groans of the PAX attendees as you're carted past them, what song will be playing in your head?**


This is hard to answer. I don't have any de-motivational songs. I will just take my loss and move on.


**Do you have anything else to say for yourself? Any last words?**


I'm looking forward to representing the community and destroying Wizards.

I write the Ars Arcanum series on [PureMTGO](http://puremtgo.com/), which uses a data-oriented approach to analyzing **Magic** formats on **Magic Online**. I also stream, and I have a non-**Magic**-related Podcast called All in the Telling with my cohost Zach Orts.


**What format do you enjoy playing the most?**


The most recent Limited format. For Constructed, I like to play Pauper or Commander.


**When did you start playing **Magic**** ?


*Tempest*. Actually, *Portal*. The first rare I opened was [Cruel Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Fate).


**Which Planeswalker do you relate to best?**


[Tamiyo, the Moon Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+the+Moon+Sage). I imagine [Tamiyo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+the+Moon+Sage) as the girl who goes from plane to plane, just watching things and taking notes, and then writing a paper about it.


**If you were a Planeswalker (aren't we all?), what would your "ultimate" ability be?**


Search your graveyard and library for any number of common cards. Exile them. You may cast them from exile without paying their mana cost.


**If you could visit any plane in the Multiverse, where would you go?**


Alara. Because I would want to enhance my body with Etherium.


**What's your favorite **Magic** card?** 


[Coiling Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coiling+Oracle). Just read the flavor text.



![Coiling Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Coiling+Oracle)

**If you win the 2013 Community Cup (you won't), what song will be playing in your head as you hoist the prestigious Hammy Cup? Feel free to skip to the next question.**


"Still Alive" by Jonathan Coulton.


**After you're defeated in the 2013 Community Cup, your dazed and defeated self will be hauled away in a squeaky wheelbarrow. Unable to blink or move, the bright lights of the Seattle Convention Center will flash before your eyes as you're removed from the premises. Hang tight, there's a question coming. Amid the gleeful and music-like laughter of the Wizards Team celebrating their fresh victory and the embarrassed groans of the PAX attendees as you're carted past them, what song will be playing in your head?**


"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow"


**Do you have anything else to say for yourself? Any last words?**


Tell them, oh, I don't know. Make up something cool, and tell them I said it.

I'm a twenty-two-year-old avid Commander player and Casual Modern player who loves **Magic**, especially deck design.


**What format do you enjoy playing the most?**


COMMANDER


**When did you start playing **Magic**** ?


2003 is when I really started playing **Magic**.


**Which Planeswalker do you relate to best?**


I identify with [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) because he does everything with astounding efficiency. He is the best-designed green Planeswalker and loves swinging with huge creatures; there is no downside.


**If you were a Planeswalker (aren't we all?), what would your "ultimate" ability be?**


-5: All creatures have haste and must attack each turn if able.


**If you could visit any plane in the Multiverse, where would you go?**


I'd visit the plane of Kamigawa just so that someone could explain to me one thing. WHY DO THE OROCHI (SNAKES) HAVE FOUR ARMS? It makes no sense! They went from being limbless to four arms + a set of legs. Someone needs to get to the bottom of this senseless mutation.


**What's your favorite **Magic** card?** 


My favorite card is [Guided Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guided+Passage). It is an innocuous-looking sorcery because people always think they are giving you your three worst spells, not realizing they are giving you three cards out of a finely tuned deck. No one expects the value from guided passage, plus I heard blue and red are good at copying spells...



![Guided Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Guided+Passage)

**If you win the 2013 Community Cup (you won't), what song will be playing in your head as you hoist the prestigious Hammy Cup? Feel free to skip to the next question.**


"Champion" by Kanye West.


**After you're defeated in the 2013 Community Cup, your dazed and defeated self will be hauled away in a squeaky wheelbarrow. Unable to blink or move, the bright lights of the Seattle Convention Center will flash before your eyes as you're removed from the premises. Hang tight, there's a question coming. Amid the gleeful and music-like laughter of the Wizards Team celebrating their fresh victory and the embarrassed groans of the PAX attendees as you're carted past them, what song will be playing in your head?**


If Wizards manages to somehow ham-fistedly win the Community Cup, the song echoing through my head would be "Missed the Boat" by Modest Mouse.


**Do you have anything else to say for yourself? Any last words?**


But don't let the song choice fool you, we will not lose. The **Magic Online** community is a strong one and the other members of the Community Cup are smart and tactful people. I fully expect to win and throw those disgusting [Darksteel Ingot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot)s back in the face of the Wizards of the Coast team! WE WILL WIN. Also, we should play Commander after.

A master of punting, I am an impassioned wizard who loves to draft. Also, I'm super Nummy.


**What format do you enjoy playing the most?**


Any Limited format, probably *Invasion* block the most.


**When did you start playing **Magic**** ?


I was introduced to the game around the release of *Tempest*, but I only ever collected the cards. I started playing a few years after that.


**Which Planeswalker do you relate to best?**


[Sarkhan Vol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Vol). I know nothing but how to play creatures and turn them sideways. Also, dragons.


**If you were a Planeswalker (aren't we all?), what would your "ultimate" ability be?**


Discard a card: Dance uncontrollably.


**If you could visit any plane in the Multiverse, where would you go?**


I hear Serra's Realm is quite nice this time of... oooh... too soon?


**What's your favorite **Magic** card?** 


[Sliver Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen). Not close.

"Single Ladies" by Beyoncé.

Unable to blink or move, the bright lights of the Seattle Convention Center will flash before your eyes as you're removed from the premises. Hang tight, there's a question coming. Amid the gleeful and music-like laughter of the Wizards Team celebrating their fresh victory and the embarrassed groans of the PAX attendees as you're carted past them, what song will be playing in your head?**

Bring it on, Wizards!

Sealed Deck, but I also really like the process of preparing for a Constructed tournament.


**When did you start playing **Magic**** ?


Started playing when I was five years old, when *Ice Age* and *Homelands* were the newest sets.


**Which Planeswalker do you relate to best?**


[Elspeth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant).


**If you were a Planeswalker (aren't we all?), what would your "ultimate" ability be?**


One-sided "[Cataclysm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cataclysm)" on the opponent.


**If you could visit any plane in the Multiverse, where would you go?**


*Lorwyn*.


**What's your favorite **Magic** card?** 


[Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith).

"Can't Touch This" by MC Hammer


**After you're defeated in the 2013 Community Cup, your dazed and defeated self will be hauled away in a squeaky wheelbarrow. Unable to blink or move, the bright lights of the Seattle Convention Center will flash before your eyes as you're removed from the premises. Hang tight, there's a question coming.

"Rains of Castamere" (The Lannister song from *Game of Thrones*)


**Do you have anything else to say for yourself? Any last words?**


The Wizards team would be powerless to deal me even a point of damage if we played all day, every day, for the next thousand years. But at least you guys can feel free to take out that frustration on my brother, Ian Duke!

I'm a competitive player and streamer, and I travel quite a bit for **Magic**.


**What format do you enjoy playing the most?**


Favorite format is probably unpowered Cube.


**When did you start playing **Magic**** ?


I started playing **Magic** around when I was twelve.


**Which Planeswalker do you relate to best?**


I would relate most to Tibalt because everybody always calls me Fiend-Blooded.


**If you were a Planeswalker (aren't we all?), what would your "ultimate" ability be?**


My ultimate would give you an emblem that says:


At the beginning of your upkeep you gain 5 life, draw a card, you get an Ooze token with power and toughness equal to the number of Ooze tokens in play, and your opponent sacrifices a permanent. The Planeswalker is called Bakakangaroo, the White-Spotted.


**If you could visit any plane in the Multiverse, where would you go?**


I would go to *Mirrodin* because I like technology.


**What's your favorite **Magic** card?** 


[Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) into [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony).

Michael Jacob was a mainstay on the Pro Tour for ten years, earning a vote in the Hall of Fame and eligibility with more than 100 Pro Points. Currently, he is looking to give back to the **Magic** community that has given so much happiness to him these past eighteen years.


**What format do you enjoy playing the most?**


Draft, whatever the most current competitive format is.


**When did you start playing **Magic**** ?


*Fallen Empires*.


**Which Planeswalker do you relate to best?**


[Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil).


**If you were a Planeswalker (aren't we all?), what would your "ultimate" ability be?**


Each player gains an emblem that says, "You cannot draw cards."

I am a competitive-minded **Magic** player who hasn't had the time to focus on the game as of late. I enjoy **Magic** for its strategic element and have a strong focus on winning. Definitely a Spike through and through. Outside of **Magic**, I am just a normal husband, school psychologist, and NBA fan.


**What format do you enjoy playing the most?**


I think my favorite format used to be Legacy, but these days it seems more like Limited.


**When did you start playing **Magic**** ?


I started playing **Magic** around the time Revised came out. **Magic** spread like wildfire in my middle school around that time. I have played the game on and off over the years but have been back since about *Mirrodin* and I've been online since *Darksteel*.


**Which Planeswalker do you relate to best?**


[Ajani](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane). He has the good-guy bent to him, but he is also not afraid to get in there and be [crazy aggressive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant) (what else do you call someone who takes on [Nicol Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker)?).


**If you were a Planeswalker (aren't we all?), what would your "ultimate" ability be?**


Search your library for a creature with converted mana cost 1, a creature with converted mana cost 2, and a creature with converted mana cost 3, and put them on the battlefield. Those creatures gain flying, haste, and double strike until end of turn.


**If you could visit any plane in the Multiverse, where would you go?**


I think it has to be Ravnica. It was a fantastic Limited environment, and the flavor of exploring mana through a full-on cityscape is very interesting.


**What's your favorite **Magic** card?** 


[Survival of the Fittest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest). It was my first Legacy deck that I tinkered with and loved the versatility and raw power of the deck (until it got the axe, of course).

**If you win the 2013 Community Cup (you won't), what song will be playing in your head as you hoist the prestigious Hammy Cup? Feel free to skip to the next question.**


How could it not by Queen's "We Are the Champions?"


**(Riding the wheelbarrow of defeat, what song is playing?)**


I try not to waste mental energy contemplating impossible scenarios like losing to Wizards. =P


**Do you have anything else to say for yourself? Any last words?**


I am incredibly honored and excited to be a part of this incredible event. Erik's amazing community presence and great attitude is what led me to want to be on  [Freed from the Real](http://www.mtgcast.com/topics/mtgcast-podcast-shows/active-podcast-shows/freed-from-the-real) . It was a pleasure to work with him for as long as I did and don't plan on letting him down by letting you guys get your grubby mitts on his trophy.

Those are our eight competitors! We look forward to battling them in the PAX Prime arena. But what will we be playing?! Let's take a very quick look at the formats that will be featured during the event:


 


* *Modern Masters* Draft— Why not start the event off in style?
* Wacky Draft— Some of you will recognize this format from the  [2012 **Magic Online** Community Cup](/en/events/coverage/community-team-learns-sorrow-defeat). It was so much fun we've decided to give it another shot with a couple exciting changes!
* Cube Draft— One of **Magic Online**'s most exciting and popular formats! Players will draft from some of the most powerful and well-known cards from throughout **Magic**'s history.
* "Ironroot Chef"— This one's a secret. You'll see!

That does it for this article. Keep your eyes peeled for another announcement later this month with even more details and an in-depth look at the Wizards Team!
