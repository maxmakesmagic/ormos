![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthon06/fm16_moreno.jpg)*Moreno was on the verge of a second Top 8 in as many Pro Tours*Billy Moreno has certainly proven this weekend that his finals appearance in Los Angeles was not a fluke. Craig Jones finally overcame his own curse and entered the Top 8 two rounds ago courtesy of Moreno technology, and Billy has given himself a chance of making the Top 8 as well if he can overcome one final opponent.


Sitting in Moreno's way is pint-sized fireball Ben Goodman, playing the Ghost Dad spiritcraft deck that has turned quite a few heads here this weekend. Goodman gave as good as he got in his match with Osyp Lebedowicz a couple of rounds ago, and is hard not to root for, especially when he is piloting such a saucy rogue creation. Regardless of who wins, they will still need external help from results in other matches to swipe the eighth and final Top 8 slot.


### Game 1


Goodman began things with a mulligan, not an ideal start against Moreno's fast deck. Moreno cast a first-turn [Kird Ape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) off of [Stomping Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground), immediately putting the Ape into overdrive. Lighting Helix on [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) gave Billy an early lead, and he followed that by casting [Savannah Lions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions) and then a second Helix on a second Bob from Goodman. Goodman chose to redirect two points of the damage to the Lions, removing [Indomitable Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indomitable+Will) in the process.


Moreno continued the *Onslaught* with [Watchwolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watchwolf) and then [Kami of Ancient Law](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law), while Goodman was unable to find more creatures and had to cast [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) on Moreno's [Kird Ape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape), forcing Billy to discard two lands. Just as Goodman looked to stabilize by making a token demon with his [Tomb of Urami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tomb+of+Urami), Moreno pointed six points of flaming filth at Goodman's dome, snuffing his five life out like one of Moreno's cigarettes.


Moreno 1 - Goodman 0

### Game 2


It was Moreno's turn to mulligan in Game 2, and his start showed that his six-card hand was a bit substandard as well when it delivered only a [Watchwolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watchwolf) and a turn-three unforested [Kird Ape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape). Meanwhile, Goodman was building a tidy little army, with [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), and [Plagued Rusalka](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plagued+Rusalka) gumming up the board while Goodman's Shoals wreaked havoc on Moreno's men and burn spells.


Moreno had a secret weapon in [Glare of Subdual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual) letting a fresh [Isamaru, Hound of Konda](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isamaru%2C+Hound+of+Konda) and [Kami of Ancient Law](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law) defuse Goodman's counterattacking ability, and threatening to allow one all-out attack plus a burn spell to kill the little leprechaun. He swears you'll never get his lucky charms.


Helix and sacrificial lambs to Rusalka left Ben short on men, but [Pillory of the Sleepless](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillory+of+the+Sleepless) locked up the [Watchwolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watchwolf), leaving Moreno's [Kami of Ancient Law](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law) to square off against Goodman's [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). Goodman's margin for error was now razor thin, with the board practically even, but Moreno's deck is built for topdecking in situations like this, and it once again delivered, putting [Char](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Char) into Billy's hands right on schedule. That [Char](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Char) gave Moreno the remotest of chance of making his second Top 8 appearance.


Final Result  

Moreno 2 - Goodman 0
