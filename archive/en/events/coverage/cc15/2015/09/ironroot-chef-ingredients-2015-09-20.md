Welcome to Ironroot Chef, where our illustrious chefs work to create delectable cuisine, capable of sating even the most ravenous of judges. This year, rather than create a bevy of small plates to be shared, the teams are putting their efforts into a grand three-course meal.

Appetizer - Standard
====================


A late seasonal selection, our appetizer for this menu is created with the hedonist in mind. The ingredient of choice is [Avarice Amulet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avarice+Amulet). Grown in the lush fields of PA, [Avarice Amulet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avarice+Amulet) is soon to be out of season, and is a rich choice for the centerpiece of a Standard appetizer.

Main Course – Commander
=======================


Here, our chefs are being judged on their ability to incorporate one of the following great leaders into a very large 100-card meal. Their Commanders of choice are the following:

With these ingredients in mind, it is up to each of the chefs to create a symphony of flavor, with all other ingredients syncing up with the general theme of their creation. A symphony is only as strong as its weakest player, however, and failure to select quality ingredients could destroy an otherwise genius creation.


Dessert – Modern
================


No meal would be complete without something to slake a sweet tooth, and there are few things in *Magic* as sweet as Modern. There is a bit more freedom to create for our chefs to close the meal out, as there is no pre-selected ingredient that must be included. This is less a meal of flavor than a meal of taste. Each chef must create their dessert using the ingredient of their choice, but the entire dish must revolve around the theme offered by that ingredient. As we are also looking for something sweet, cards like [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), and [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) are not allowed, as they have a tendency to leave a bitter taste in the mouth.
