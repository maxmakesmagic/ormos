It was an all-Toronto showdown to cap the city's largest-ever Magic Tournament. The crowd was divided, but seemed to favor the more decorated veteran, Lucas Siow. Siow had come close before, but had yet to take a title. This was only Magalhaes's second Top 8. If anything, courtesy dictated that Siow should earn the crown.




**The Games**




Things started off slowly. Siow was first on the board with a morph. Magalhaes took a turn off to scry with Temple of Deceit. Siow hit for two and then dropped Siege Rhino. Magalhaes untapped and took care of it with Crackling Doom, but Siow was happy to replace it.



Draconic Roar took care of the face-down [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) before it could escort another Rhino to the party. [Foul-Tongue Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foul-Tongue+Invocation) completed the sweep of Siow's board. He replaced it with a rather anemic [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) while Magalhaes sent [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) overhead. Siow's sixth mana let him enlist Elspeth's help and she went to one loyalty to get rid of the Dragon.

Magalhaes wasn't out of gas yet. An end-of-turn [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut) (at a full discount) took care of the Courser, and then a second Stormbreath hit play and sent Elspeth packing. Siow had yet another removal spell for this dragon, but the bad news was that it was joined by a dashing Kolaghan, Storm's Fury. [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) caught it a turn later, but Magalhaes got it back with Haven of the Spirit Dragon, and finally Siow was forced to admit that that was enough dragons.




Magalhaes 1 – Siow 0




Magalhaes paused over his opening hand, but decided to keep. A [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) from Siow revealed the predicament: A hand with just two [Caves of Koilos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caves+of+Koilos) for mana. He took away [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master) and left Magalhaes with two [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon)s, a [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom), [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent), and .



“So… basically, my hand his irrelevant. Either you draw three lands and beat me or…”



They played two lands apiece.



“Moment of truth…” murmured Siow.

Magalhaes peeled [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). Not ideal, but far from the worst. He caught Elspeth and left Siow with a dismal hand of [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) and [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command). Siow drew a brick and passed. Magalhaes slid his card up… another miss.



That was the beginning of the end. Siow pulled up [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker) and started to make 4/4's.



“Daniel Fournier says ‘Whenever you don't know what to do just bring in all the Nissas, because it kills them.'”



Oh, it did.




Magalhaes 1 – Siow



For the deciding game Siow kept his opener, while Magalhaes went down to six. And then five. Siow kept a poker face, even though a tournament win was becoming that much more likely.



Magalhaes led with [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) and then [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master) after Siow put [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) onto the battlefield. Siow added a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and waited. Magalhaes didn't have a way to bust through right away, so he just played his fourth land and a [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent). It was knocked out of the sky by [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall). Magalhaes played his fifth land and passed with just one card left in hand. The mulligans had taken the wind out of his sails.



From there, things only got worse. Siow fuelled up with Read the Bones. Kolaghan's Command undid some of it, getting back the Regent, but Siow was long on removal. The one thing he needed was land, but the Courser stubbornly revealed spell after spell. Magalhaes added a second [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) to his board, unable to make headway.



Whether it was the long tournament taking its toll or the seeming hopelessness of his situation getting to him, Magalhaes blundered away a second Kolaghan's Command trying to foil a [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) on his Seekers. Prowess is not an optional ability. If there's any mercy, it's that it was unlikely to be the difference maker. Siow was still fully stocked on action and sending in his troops. Magalhaes tried to hide behind [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) and Soulfire Grand Master, but [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) and Elspeth, Sun's Champion wiped his board and gave Siow the championship.
