Ouphes have been aroung **Magic** for years. They first appeared in *Ice Age,* although the Grand Creature Type Update rewrote them farther into the past. Let's take a look at how the humble Ouphe has changed through the years.


[![Brown Ouphe](https://web.archive.org/web/20160812130254im_/http://www.wizards.com/magic/images/cardart/IA/Brown_Ouphe_640.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Brown%2BOuphe)

This is your simple, garden variety, [Brown Ouphe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brown+Ouphe). Note the pointy ears and hairy back. For *Mirrodin*, the Brown one was updated, but still maintained his basic Oupheyness.

Going further into the past, to the cards that were retroactively granted citizenship in the Ouphe Nation, [Pyknite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyknite) looks a little cranky about things:

Clearly, he should take a page from the [Shelkin Brownie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelkin+Brownie), who looks resigned to his fate:

Or, he could just embrace his newfound Ouphe-osity, like [Niall Silvain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niall+Silvain), who looks delighted!

These days, Ouphes come pre-Ouphed. Which brings us around, however laboriously, to the reason we're bringing all this up: [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) is a funny card and we think it looks great when it's blown up. Take it away, Finks!
