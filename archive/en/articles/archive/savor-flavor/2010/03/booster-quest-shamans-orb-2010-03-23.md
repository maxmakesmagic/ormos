Booster Quest: The Shaman's Orb
===============================



 Posted in **Savor The Flavor**
 on March 24, 2010 










If there was a knock at your private study door, you failed to hear it. You had been on Zendikar for months, studying the runes of a strange stone hedron, and the artifact's ancient gouges had just begun playing at the borders of legible. The minotaur's kick, regardless of its prior announcement status, tears the hinges and splinters the iron-reinforced oak as if the door had been nothing but a decrepit kitesail.

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_mystery.jpg)  
Thankfully, you determine it's no attack—though the minotaur's eyes are frantic, his breath comes in great nasal snorts, and he holds a massive war maul in his hand, he doesn't advance past the threshold that is now fully unobstructed by a door. The beast stands there, struck for words. You raise your eyebrows, wondering what news could possibly justify such a mistreatment of wood.

"I was to be disturbed from my studies only in case of an emergency," you say, in the spirit of interrogative discovery.

"There's a ... dragon," he manages. "Does a dragon qualify?"

Booster Quest!
Hello and welcome to another Booster Quest! This is an adventure game played using the contents of a **Magic** booster as your magical arsenal. If you missed [the first Booster Quest](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/68), this section will give you a run-down of the rules. Or, if you're all set and ready to go, grab a booster and a die, and get rolling on the [first quest](#firstquest)!

You will need:

* An unopened (or newly opened) booster pack of any **Magic** set, including the basic land and token if applicable.
* A regular six-sided die (d6)

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20130613211918im_/http://wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_packAndDie.jpg)  
**Challenges**  
 A game of Booster Quest is a series of challenges that represent your progress through an arduous quest. Each challenge is a situation in which you'll roll your d6, attempting to get as high a result as possible. In order to win, you must fail a maximum of *one* challenge along the quest, and you *must* succeed at the *last* challenge of the quest. It'll be tough, but luckily, you'll have a trusted ally with you on your journey: your booster pack. Your booster is your magical arsenal that will help you overcome the challenges and complete your quest.

**How to Complete your Quest**  
 Once you defeat the quest's final challenge, having only failed a maximum of one challenge along the way, you complete that quest and win the game. If you fail more than one of the challenges, or if you fail the final challenge of the quest, you lose (but you can try the quest again, with the same booster or a different one). Note: This article has three quests. Each one of them is considered a separate game of Booster Quest (but it'll be fun if you try to beat all three).

**Using Cards in Challenges**  
 Each challenge will have you check your booster for a card or cards that fit certain criteria. If your booster contains card(s) that fit the criteria of the challenge, you can get a bonus to your die roll, or even succeed at the challenge outright.


> *Example:*  
> **The Spellcrafter's Lock**  
>  You face an intricate arcane lock that stands between you and your goal. You'll need just the right spell to unravel the lock and proceed on your quest.
> 
> * To succeed at this challenge, roll a 4 or greater on your d6.
> * If your booster contains an instant or a sorcery, you may add +2 to your roll.
> 

You choose which card to apply to the challenge. If more than one card fits the criteria, you can only choose one of them; you can only get the stated bonus once per challenge. (Some challenges have multiple criteria that allow for additive bonuses.)

Any card in your booster can count toward more than one challenge during a quest. If you have a six-mana Zombie creature in your booster, it can count toward a challenge that asks for a Zombie, *and* toward a later challenge that asks for a creature of converted mana cost 6 or more.

**The Foil Rule**  
 A premium foil card is a scintillating, special bit of magic to have in your booster, and it can get you out of a jam. If your booster contains a premium foil card, you can use it as a "wild" card on any *one* challenge in your quest; in that instance, it counts as satisfying all the criteria for that challenge, entitling you to whatever bonus you wish. You can only do this once per quest—once you use a foil card to count toward a challenge, you may not use its "foilyness" again to satisfy another challenge within that quest. However, if the foil card has other qualities (color, cost, creature type, etc.) that can satisfy other challenges, you may use it for those other challenges on those other merits.

 Got all that? Okay! Find a booster (opened or unopened, doesn't matter) and a six-sider and let's get questing.

Booster Quest A: Why Did it Have to Be Huge Flying Lizards?
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20130614042444im_/http://wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_searingBlaze.jpg)  
**Challenge A1: The Dragon's Exhalation**

It's not that often that your planeswalker status is known when you travel from plane to plane. But that was the first question asked of you when you rented the room in Sea Gate. You follow the minotaur out of your building, and instantly suffer an attack from above, right there in the center of the village—from the dragon. A column of caustic fire rains down on you. This would be a good time to use a little magic to save your hide.

* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 3 or greater on your d6.
* If your booster contains a card with the word "prevent," "counter," or "shroud" in its rules text, you succeed at this challenge automatically.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20171007162542im_/http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_elementalAppeal.jpg)  
**Challenge A2: Return Lightning**

All right, it is now officially *on*. This dragon clearly did not know who it was messing with. What was it you were supposed to fight fire with again? Oh, that's right—*lightning*. Summon up a blast of electrical energy to show that dragon what red mana is all about.

* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 4 or greater on your d6.
* If your booster contains a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) or another card that can produce red mana, get a +2 on your roll.
* If your booster contains a red instant or sorcery card, you succeed at this challenge automatically.

**Challenge A3: Time is of the Essence**

Direct hit. Your blast of electrical mayhem tore a nasty hole right through the dragon's wing membrane. It shrieks and starts flapping away. You guess this was no random attack, and you know you have to make chase. But there's a second problem: the corrosive breath of the dragon has caused several buildings around you to catch fire, threatening the lives of many if it should spread. You'll need to be quick to help put out the flames and still catch up with the dragon. If only there were some way to *clone* yourself ....

* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 4 or greater on your d6.
* If your booster contains a card with the word "haste," "flash," or "copy" in its rules text and/or the word "Time" in its name, get a +4 on your roll.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20130613195902im_/http://wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_aetherTradewinds.jpg)  
**Challenge A4: Hot Pursuit**

The village is safe; now it's time to track down that dragon. You and your minotaur friend follow it on foot as best you can, until the big lizard flies over a ravine, leaving you behind. You find a rickety rope bridge over the ravine, but vicious ætheric winds whip across the chasm, making it a dangerous passage. You'll need a way to strengthen that bridge, or some way to calm those winds, or else you'll never make it across.

* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 5 or greater on your d6.
* If your booster contains an enchantment, get a +2 on your roll.
* If your booster contains a Wizard, get a +2 on your roll.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20130614042504im_/http://wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_mordantDragon.jpg)  
**Final Challenge A5: The Dragon Imbued**

The bridge holds, and you make your way across with your minotaur compatriot. You track the dragon through the night and on into the next day, and finally come upon the beast. You wounded it before, but now it looks healed—not only healed, but it glows with a shimmering magical aura. Someone must have enchanted the creature, strengthening it against your attacks. Your minotaur friend readies his enormous war maul, but looks to you. It'll take some devastating and unconventional magic to defeat the creature, but you think you recall an incantation that might just do the trick.

* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 5 or greater on your d6.
* If your booster contains a rare or mythic rare noncreature card, get a +2 on your roll.
* If your booster contains a card that has flavor text in the form of a quote (it has quotation marks, whether it has an attribution or not), you succeed at this challenge automatically.

If you succeeded at this final challenge, and failed a maximum of one of the other challenges, you've completed this booster quest! If you failed two or more challenges, or if you failed the final challenge, you'll have to try the quest again before moving on to the next quest. Beware: the next quest will be a little harder.

Booster Quest B: The Trail of the Orb
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20130614041608im_/http://wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_cryptRipper.jpg)  
**Challenge B1: Death Perception**

You and your minotaur companion have taken down the [Mordant Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mordant+Dragon) that plagued the residents of Sea Gate. But it's clear to you that there's much more going on here than a solo flying lizard. You'll need to find out what caused this dragon attack—and your intuition is telling you that whoever enchanted the beast before your fight is behind it all. But you need more information before you can move on. If only there were a way to analyze the last few moments of the dragon's life—perhaps a little necromantic spirit-sight is in order.

* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 3 or greater on your d6.
* If your booster contains a Spirit, a black creature, or a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) card, get a +2 on your roll.

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_merfolkwayfinder.jpg)  
**Challenge B2: Following a Vision**

The necromantic spell brings you a murky vision of the closing chapter of the dragon's life. It's hard to make sense of the images that fill your mind, but it's clear that the creature's spirit raged with unnatural, external influences. There's one symbol that stands out lucidly in your mind: a fist-sized orb of amber, golden and translucent as fire. You've seen no evidence of such an artifact in your travels thus far, but it's a lead. Your minotaur companion suggests you and he journey to a merfolk enclave on the other side of the Halimar Sea, where they have a great archive. That will take days, unless you're able to summon a mount that can get you there quicker.

* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 4 or greater on your d6.
* If your booster contains a creature with flying, haste, or islandwalk, you succeed at this challenge automatically.

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_archmage.jpg)  
**Challenge B3: The Enclave's Lyceum**

The merfolk agree to grant you access to their archives, but they warn you that it's not a traditional library of the sort you might be used to. As you enter the central chamber, magical runes swirl around you, overwhelming you with mystical code. It'll take an act of genius not only to decipher the cryptograms, but also to find the clues you need about the orb made of amber.

* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 5 or greater on your d6.
* For each card in your booster that has the word "draw" and/or the word "search" in its rules text, get a +2 on your roll.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20130614045222im_/http://wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_hedronRover.jpg)  
**Challenge B4: Braving the Hedron Fields**

Your brain feels a little like an over-soaked sponge, but you've found the clue you needed. The orb of amber was associated with a kor artificer who was last seen wandering the southern hedron-fields of Tazeem. Could she be the one who sent the dragon? You and the minotaur journey onward through the wilds of Tazeem, where you witness troubling mystical phenomena: the enormous hedrons that lay dormant in the fields for centuries have begun to wrench free of the earth. The huge stone diamonds hover into the air, aggregating together in bizarre arrangements as if drawn to one another by magnetic forces. In fact, one set of hedrons before you seems to have taken on living form—and moves to destroy you, unless you can destroy it first.

* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 5 or greater on your d6.
* If your booster contains a creature of power 4 or greater, get a +2 on your roll.
* If your booster contains a Shaman or a card that can destroy a 4/4 [Hedron Rover](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Rover), you succeed at this challenge automatically.

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_stoneforge.jpg)  
**Challenge B5: The Forger of Stone**

The hedron-creature behind you, you set out again to find the kor artificer. You come upon a kor woman meditating near her camp, and watch for an awed moment as she manipulates a massive boulder of iron ore with her mind. Out of the sphere of rock appears a perfectly fashioned longsword, as if she had labored for weeks in a blacksmith's forge. You confront her about the dragon and the orb of amber. She says she'll tell you what you want to know only if you can prove your merit in a duel.

* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 5 or greater on your d6.
* For each instant card in your booster, get a +1 on your roll.
* If your booster contains an Equipment or a card with "strike" in its rules text, get an additional +2 on your roll.

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_novablast.jpg)  
**Final Challenge B6: The Omnivorous Adversary**

You overwhelm the kor artificer with impeccable swiftness. She bows to your skill with the blade, and confesses that while she had nothing to do with the dragon, she was involved in constructing an orb made of amber. She tells the story of how a client once gave her a fragment of glossy black material, obsidian in color but otherworldly in texture, and told her to build a prison for it. The fragment thrummed with a sinister potency, and she built the amber orb to contain and direct its power. Her client was a human woman, she says, a shaman who wore the face-paint of a western tribe. Before the artificer can explain further, however, there is a horrific, ground-shaking roar, and the kor woman is incinerated in a flash of light. Behind the spot where she stood is a terrible wurm, its coils writhing with deadly white energy, its jaws glistening with unearthly hunger. You and your minotaur ally glance at each other, readying hammer and spell—you two will have to team up to defeat the [Novablast Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Novablast+Wurm), or perish.

* This challenge is a little different. For this challenge, roll *two* d6s. To succeed at this challenge, each roll must be 4 or greater.
* If your booster contains a Minotaur, Warrior, or Wurm, or has a card with a Minotaur in its art, get a +2 on the *minotaur's* roll.
* If your booster contains a card with the words "target creature" in its rules text, get an additional +2 on *your* roll.
* If your booster contains a mythic rare, you may change one of the dice to a 6 after rolling.

If you succeeded at this final challenge, and failed a maximum of one of the other challenges, you've completed this booster quest! If you failed two or more challenges, or if you failed the final challenge, you'll have to try the quest again before moving on to the final booster quest.

Booster Quest C: The Master Revealed
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20130614035353im_/http://wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_ruinousMinotaur.jpg)  
**Challenge C1: Betrayed!**

You have defeated the [Novablast Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Novablast+Wurm), but you've suffered a nasty shock to the system in overcoming its white-hot destructive energy. Your mana is nearly depleted and your magical defenses are low. You look over at your minotaur companion. Not only is he not hurt, but he seems to be moving toward you in a most aggressive manner. He attacks you, swinging his war maul and landing a crushing blow, hurling you into the air like a limp doll! You land roughly, alive but in a stupor—perhaps even magically impaired. What could have brought on this betrayal? What's going on here? With the last of your mana reserves, you whip up a quick spell to get to the bottom of this illusion.

* *Special:* The minotaur's blow has damaged your magical arsenal. Before you undertake this challenge, shuffle your booster face-down and then remove a card at random. You will be without that card for the remainder of this booster quest.
* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 3 or greater on your d6.
* If your booster contains an Illusion or enchantment card, or a card that can destroy an enchantment, get a +2 on your roll.

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_dragonmaster.jpg)  
**Challenge C2: Unmasked!**

Even in your weakened state, you manage enough magic to dispel the illusion magic surrounding the minotaur. The image of the minotaur and his war maul crumbles away, revealing a human woman, [a fierce-looking shaman](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/375) carrying a mystic staff. Rooted in the end of the staff is an orb of amber—this must be the very shaman who came to the kor artificer! 

You accuse her of causing the dragon attack, and her laugh is proud and wicked. She tells you she knew her dragon would bring you out into the open, and she knew the wild goose chase to find *her* would weaken your defenses. Now she gets to fulfill the dream she's had ever since she was a shaman's apprentice: to *kill a planeswalker*. It's a fight to the death.

The first thing you'll need to do is recover your mana and magical defenses before she strikes again.

* *Special:* As a reminder, you removed a random card from your booster, so you should still be down a card for the remainder of the quest.
* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 4 or greater on your d6.
* If your booster contains an artifact or an Elf, get a +2 on your roll.
* If your booster contains a land or a Druid, you succeed at this challenge automatically.

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_pyromancer.jpg)  
**Challenge C3: The Opening Salvo**

The dragonmaster arcs a blast of caustic fire at you from her staff, but you manage to roll out of the way while reconnecting with your mana bonds. Mana surges through your body, and you form a spell that channels all of your rage and malice at your foe. 

* *Special:* To succeed at this challenge, roll a d6 and *record the result*. (You can't fail at this challenge, but save your total number for use in the next challenge.)
* If your booster contains a card with "destroy," "damage," or "loses" in its rules text, get a +2 on your roll.
* If your booster contains a card with an X in its cost or rules text, get an additional +2 on your roll.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20171007162544im_/http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_relicCrush.jpg)  
**Challenge C4: Crushing the Staff**

As the dragonmaster reels from your blast, you concentrate on separating her from her source of power: her staff. You summon forces of nature to destroy the staff, carrying over the intensity and anger of your previous spell to help wreck the accursed artifact.

*Special:* Add your result from the *previous* challenge to this roll.  
 To succeed at this challenge, roll an 8 or greater on your d6.  
 If your booster contains a Beast, a Berserker, or a card that can destroy an artifact, get a +2 on your roll.

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_hellkite.jpg)  
**Challenge C5: Mago a Mago**

The dragonmaster's staff is separated from her, and probably destroyed—but the orb of amber rolls away, still intact, still containing the shard of dark power. The two of you square off, mage to mage. You begin summoning up a quick army of creatures, while she summons a massive, ancient dragon of Zendikar. It will be up to your minions to stop her huge hellkite.

* *Special:* If you *failed* the *previous* challenge, get a -2 on this roll.
* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 5 or greater on your d6.
* If your booster contains a token creature card, or a card with "token" in its rules text, get a +2 on your roll.
* If your booster contains a rare or mythic rare creature, get an additional +2 on your roll.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20171007160145im_/http://wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_ragingRavine.jpg)  
**Final Challenge C6: Zendikar's Aid**

As your creatures clash into one another, it's time to go for the throat—to defeat this evil dragonmaster once and for all. You call on all the forces of Zendikar to come to your aid. The ground trembles, and then *rises up* as a force of elementals to answer your call. The time to end this is now.

* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 6 or greater on your d6.
* If your booster contains an Elemental and/or a card with an activated ability (one with a colon in it, such as "![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif): Untap target Forest."), get a +2 on your roll.
* If your booster contains a nonbasic land, a card with the word "becomes" in its rules text, or an Aura that can target a land, get an additional +2 on your roll.
* *Special:* If you have failed no challenges during this quest, get an additional +2 on your roll.

This is the final challenge of this quest—if you succeed at it and failed no more than one other challenge, you succeed at this quest. But if you're up for it, there's one more challenge that faces you. Can you defeat it too?

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/stf/stf83_pathrazer.jpg)  
**Bonus Challenge C7: A Fragment of Dread Ulamog**

The dragonmaster—and her vendetta against you—lie defeated. She'll harm no more villagers with her dragons and she'll never get her wish to kill a planeswalker. But the orb of amber remains. Its shard of dark power throbs within the amber. Suddenly the amber cracks, and a wave of repellent energy arcs out from its center. Without warning, a horrible creature rises up from the spot where the orb landed—this must be an Eldrazi, the key to the runes you were studying in the hedron. A deadly halo of utter annihilation spreads out from the creature, threatening to engulf you and all life around you. You must take down this horror before it wreaks havoc on the plane.

* To succeed at this challenge, roll a 6 or greater on your d6.
* If your booster contains a Cleric, a planeswalker, or a card with the word "it" in its flavor text, get a +2 on your roll.
* If your booster contains a card with converted mana cost 6 or more, get an additional +2 on your roll.
* If your booster contains a rare or mythic rare instant, sorcery, or enchantment, you succeed at this challenge automatically.
* *Special:* You may use a *second booster* to augment your roll on this final challenge.

You defeat the horrendous Eldrazi creature, saving the continent of Tazeem from its destruction. You realize that this abomination was the key to your studies all along—the runes in the hedrons describe a planewide imprisonment meant to last for all of time, clearly meant to contain these Eldrazi horrors. But if the dragonmaster shaman was able to use Eldrazi power for her own purposes, what does that mean for the state of the Eldrazi imprisonment? Has the seal been broken somehow? On Zendikar, there's only one way to discover the answers—you must embark on yet another quest.

Hope you enjoyed this BOOSTER QUEST!
