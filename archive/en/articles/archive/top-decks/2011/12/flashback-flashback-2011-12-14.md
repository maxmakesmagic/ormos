Yes, yes, we have some very nice flashback today.

Patrick Chapin says that [Desperate Ravings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings) is so good we will someday consider it a kind of [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and players as successful as a Gerry Thompson or a Jon Finkel will bend their decks to accommodate it. [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) and [Forbidden Alchemy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) do—if not everything a blue mage wants—enough, such that Nick Spagnolo once confessed that he just wants to play with them "forever."

And then there is [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), which doesn't in fact have flashback, but makes it so that everything else does.
