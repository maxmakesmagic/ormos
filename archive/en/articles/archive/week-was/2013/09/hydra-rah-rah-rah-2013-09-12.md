Sometimes it feels like there is a Hydra with X in its casting cost in every **Magic** set, yet time and time again they fail to crack the starting line-up in Standard. What is not to like about flexible fatties that have all sorts of special abilities while letting you use all your mana? [Just look back at some of the candidates](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;subtype=+[%22Hydra%22]amp;mana=+~[X]amp;format=+[%22Modern%22]) that have not emerged with a starting job over the past few Standard seasons.

[Apocalypse Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Apocalypse+Hydra) was super exciting when it was previewed. Just imagine casting this thing for seven mana and ending up with a 10/10 machine gun. It can pick off random would-be heroes that get in its path or it can just provide the reach to end the game shooting those final points of damage at the opposing player. Of course, that would involve tapping out, giving your opponent a turn to untapâ€”or maybe even just do something during your end step. Just too much down payment for something that might not make it to the next turn even if you get to double down on the counters.
