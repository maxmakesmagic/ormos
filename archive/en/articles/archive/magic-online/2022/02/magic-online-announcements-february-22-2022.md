*Black Is Magic* Celebration
----------------------------


Celebrate Black History and excellence during February and every month with us here on *Magic Online*! Read on to find out how you can score the entire *Secret Lair: Black Is Magic* drop by simply playing *Magic*!


![Black Is Magic on MTGO](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/2nsd2Dweu_BIM.png)


For each week in February, we'll be keeping tabs on accounts that simply play *and finish* an entire game of *Magic* each week. Whether that's a round in the Pauper League, a match playing *Innistrad: Double Feature* or *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* draft, or just a Commander game with friends, you'll eventually be able to earn all these cards on March 1.


Playing games during these weeks will earn you the following cards. But if you just play a game each week in February, you're in the clear to receive the entire *Secret Lair* drop on *Magic Online*!


* **Week 1**: Shalai, Voice of Plenty
* **Week 2**: Cultivate
* **Week 3**: Path of Ancestry
* **Week 4 (started today at midnight PT)**: Ponder
* **Two-Week Combo**: Kaya, Ghost Assassin
* **Three-Week Combo**: Sol Ring
* **Four-Week Combo**: Teferi, Hero of Dominaria
