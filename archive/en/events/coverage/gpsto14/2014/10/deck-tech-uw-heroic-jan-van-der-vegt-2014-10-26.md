 Most players at Grand Prix Stockholm opted for more traditional strategies, but Jan van der Vegt brought a spicy one to the table: U/W Heroic! Or "Falcon Punch!" as he calls it, in reference to the singleton [Abzan Falconer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Falconer) that can push heroic creatures through a creature stall.





*Jan van der Vegt is feeling heroic.*
