**Card of the Day - vendredi 29 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Oath%20of%20Lim-D%C3%BBl)#### Oath of Lim-Dûl


 *Ice Age* rare. The Alpha card Lich has spawned a number of variants over the years that play with the idea of cards substituting as a player's life total in some way, but Oath of Lim-Dûl often gets forgotten from the group since it's the only version that doesn't actually have "lich" in the name. (See Lich, Lich's Tomb, Nefarious Lich, and also the drawback on Dralnu, Lich Lord.)
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 28 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Squandered%20Resources)#### Squandered Resources


 *Visions* rare. This powerful combo enabler was one of the key pieces of ProsBloom, arguably the first serious tournament combo deck. It thus has the distinction of being the only enchantment ever banned from a Block Constructed format.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 27 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pestilence)#### Pestilence


 *Limited Edition* Alpha common. Pestilence is easily one of the most powerful common cards ever printed for Limited formats. With the advent of *Sixth Edition*, it was moved to uncommon—and the *Sixth Edition* rules changes removed a saucy combo with Circle of Protection: Black that had been popular in early Constructed formats. Prior to *Sixth Edition*, one Circle activation could prevent a whole batch of Pestilence damage, rather than just 1 point.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 26 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ghostly%20Flame)#### Ghostly Flame


 *Ice Age* rare. The ability to become colorless—the logical extension of Ghostly Flame's rules text—would later become primarily a red (and artifact) ability, as evidenced by Raging Spirit / Ancient Kavu and Ersatz Gnomes. Ghostly Flame—like Gloom before it, printed for the specific purpose of getting around white's damage prevention effects—would later lend inspiration to *Time Spiral* Block nostalgia riffs Ghostflame Sliver and Ghostfire. Note, however, that while a black creature can damage Paladin *en*-Vec with a Ghostly Flame out, it still can't block one.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 25 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Circle%20of%20Protection:%20Red)#### Circle of Protection: Red


 *Limited Edition* Alpha common. Of all the circles of protection, Circle of Protection: Red has appeared in the most **Magic** sets. Through *Eighth Edition*, there were circles of protection from each color in each core set, but *Ninth Edition* cut those down to just the colors that were actually enemies of white. That should have meant that the black and red circles were tied for most sets, but Circle of Protection: Black was inadvertently left out of the Alpha set and thus wasn't printed until Beta (along with Volcanic Island, the other card missing from Alpha).
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 22 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Drekavac)#### Drekavac


 *Dissension* uncommon. Although many monster names in **Magic** are invented from scratch, Drekavac is not one of them. Pronounced "DREK-ah-vats" in its source language, this mythical creature of south Slavic folklore was believed to be the tortured soul of a dead unbaptized child.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 21 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Carven%20Caryatid)#### Carven Caryatid


 *Ravnica* uncommon. "Caryatid" is a Latin word for a pillar sculpted into the shape of a female figure, originally coming from the Greek word for the priestesses of Artemis at Caryae. Carven Caryatid's creature type, Spirit, reflects an attempt to make the *Kamigawa* and *Ravnica* blocks play better together. Originally the *Ravnica* setting had no Spirits, but they were worked into both the cards and the story to promote cross-block synergy.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 20 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fugue)#### Fugue


 *Exodus* uncommon. In addition to its musical meaning (such as in J.S. Bach's "Toccata and Fugue in D minor" or *Guys and Dolls*' "A Fugue for Tinhorns"), "fugue" is a psychiatric term that refers to an amnesic episode-a period of memory loss, befitting a discard spell that causes a player to "forget" some of the spells in his or her hand.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 19 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Copper%20Myr)#### Copper Myr


 *Mirrodin* common. The myr, short for "myrmidon," a Greek word meaning "servant," were designed by illustrator Matthew D. Wilson. Although both Wizards and players were very pleased with Kev Walker's illustrations for the cycle of common, color-keyed myr, the prolific illustrator is rumored to have been a bit bored by the assignment because of the similarity of the five little simulacra.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 18 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ire%20of%20Kaminari)#### Ire of Kaminari


 *Betrayers of Kamigawa* common. The Japanese word "kaminari" means "lightning," but with the honorific-"kaminari-sama"-it can also refer to the kami of lightning, the "lightning spirit" of the Shinto belief system. The lightning spirit is also referred to as "*laijin*."
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 15 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kavu%20Titan)#### Kavu Titan


 *Invasion* rare. Kavu Titan is one of many creatures—stop us if you've heard this one—that are basically always better to have in your deck than poor old Grizzly Bears. The trend began with Muscle Sliver (a liability if your opponent has Slivers, but a much better choice in the abstract) and has continued since. How many creatures are there that have the same cost and effective stats as Grizzly Bears and an ability that is "all upside"? Click here.   
We count eleven: Muscle Sliver, Kavu Titan, Nomadic Elf, Wild Mongrel, Stonewood Invoker, Gempalm Strider, Transluminant, Aquastrand Spider, Boreal Centaur, Ashcoat Bear, and Kavu Predator. (Humble Budoka and Riftsweeper don't make the list, as they can easily render your own cards useless.) With *Future Sight*, Grizzly Bears finally gets an edge—thanks to Muraganda Petroglyphs!
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 14 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Orim's%20Chant)#### Orim's Chant


 *Planeshift* rare. Though Orim was originally intended as a minor character, she was eventually to have as many cards named after her possessively—that is, "Orim's"—as any other *Weatherlight* storyline character, and more than most. How many "Orim's" cards are there, what sets are they in, and what other *Weatherlight* character has as many? No points for using Gatherer! Click here.   
There are five: Orim's Prayer (*Tempest*), Orim's Cure (*Mercadian Masques*), Orim's Touch (*Invasion*), Orim's Chant (*Planeshift*), and Orim's Thunder (*Apocalypse*). The only other *Weatherlight* character to have as many is Gerrard.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 13 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kangee,%20Aerie%20Keeper)#### Kangee, Aerie Keeper


 *Invasion* rare. When the Bird type was consolidated with the various Vultures, Falcons, Aesthir, Pigeons, Mana Birds, Rocs, etc., some players were concerned about the fate of a certain *Homelands* card, then the only "lord" of any Bird-related type. Not only did Kangee come along to provide a genuine Bird "lord," but the *Homelands* card received errata so that it helped all Birds as well. What was that card, and what creature type was it "lord" of before the consolidation? Click here.   
Soraya the Falconer, who previously gave bonuses to Falcons—which there were only two of when she was printed.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 12 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Verdeloth%20the%20Ancient)#### Verdeloth the Ancient


 *Invasion* rare. During *Unhinged*, Verdeloth was featured in the art of the card Name Dropping. The designers knew that they wanted a prominent **Magic** character wearing a "Hello, My Name Is" sticker, and Verdeloth was chosen. Partly this was because a tree wearing a name tag and "Hello, My Name Is Verdeloth" are funny, and partly it was because his name contains "the," making him especially likely to be returned with Name Dropping. Verdeloth also appears in the art of what *Planar Chaos* card? Click here.   
Wild Pair.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 11 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Phyrexian%20Scuta)#### Phyrexian Scuta


 *Planeshift* rare. One of the things that entertains R&D is making cards that hearken back to powerful cards from earlier eras in the game's history—particularly when those earlier cards were considered overpowered, either at the time or in the abstract. Phyrexian Scuta—like Plague Sliver after it—is an homage to what *Arabian Night* powerhouse? Click here.   
Juzam Djinn.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 8 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Skeleton%20Ship)#### Skeleton Ship


 *Ice Age* rare. Tom Wänerstrand says: "Skeleton Ship was fun as I worked together with Amy Weber—we passed the painting back and forth over a couple days, and it is a weird mix of styles. The ship itself is a bit of an homage to Pirate Ship." Current art director Jeremy Jarvis discussed cards illustrated by two artists in this Ask Wizards.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 7 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ghost%20Ship)#### Ghost Ship


 *The Dark* common. Tom Wänerstrand says: "[My art for] Ghost Ship was almost not used because the ship is not clearly flying. I offered to re-work it, but it was ultimately used as-is."
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 6 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pirate%20Ship)#### Pirate Ship


 *Limited Edition* Alpha rare. Tom Wänerstrand says: "Pirate Ship was the first piece I ever painted for **Magic**. There was no real art description, but I knew it would be reproduced small, so I simply created a whimsical ship with a lot of color that would show up well at size. Jesper Myrfors—**Magic**'s original art director—liked the piece so much that he bought the original and continued to assign ships to me on other sets."
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 5 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Reef%20Pirates)#### Reef Pirates


 *Fifth Edition* common. *Fifth Edition* was a massive 449, easily the largest Magic set ever made (larger than Time Spiral's 422). The set marked the removal of many "staples" like Serra Angel, Lightning Bolt, and Swords to Plowshares, but made up for the losses by including great handfuls of underpowered cards—including 29 from the *Homelands* expansion.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 4 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Merchant%20Ship)#### Merchant Ship


 *Arabian Nights* uncommon. Merchant Ship was the first zero-power creature built for attacking. Later additions to the category include Swamp Mosquito, Lim-Dûl's Paladin, Guiltfeeder, and Vintage "silver bullet" Xantid Swarm.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 1 juin 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shadow%20Guildmage)#### Shadow Guildmage

No creatures are more evocative of *Ravnica*’s two-color guild theme than its guildmages. These two-mana 2/2s used the new hybrid symbols to show they can be played with mana of either color in their guild. Since each guildmage has two activated abilities, one from each color, playing both colors unlocks all its potential. And because neither ability requires tapping, they can both be used, separately or together, several times in a single turn.
