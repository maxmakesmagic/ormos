Hello, and welcome back to Decks of the Week, post-Thanksgiving edition! To help our American readers recuperate from their holiday, we're providing everyone with plenty of reading material: two weeks worth of decklists!

First on the docket are *Shards of Alara* Sealed Top 8 lists from the PTQ season for Kyoto. There are a few weeks left to qualify, so if you haven't made it out yet, [what are you waiting for](/en/node/640906)? You can prepare for the event by scoping out the strategies that have been successful so far this season, and of course [you can practice 24/7](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/digital/magiconline.aspx) thanks to **Magic Online**.

Following that up we've got some more State Championship lists that have arrived. If you haven't figured out what to play in Standard yet, they're a great place to start! And, last but certainly not least, we have a ton of **Magic Online** Premier Events to bring you including *Onslaught* qualifier results, the Top 8s from the [Game in the Gulf](/en/events/coverage/magic-cruise-qualifying-season-top-8-decklists) cruise qualifiers, and more! So shake off your tryptophan-induced comas and get reading!
