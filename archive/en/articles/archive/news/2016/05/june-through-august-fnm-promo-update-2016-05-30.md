Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






It's almost June, so it's time to announce the promos that Friday Night *Magic* players can look forward to over the next three months. They are shiny, and soon they can all be yours.


**June**


Looking for something? Well, if that something is a land (that's right, any land), [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) will help you find it—with new art from Christine Choi.

[Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) Promo | Art by [Christine Choi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Christine+Choi%22%5d)
**July**


Play in an FNM this July, and this could be you! Wait, *yours*, not you. (Wizards of the Coast does not endorse, condone, or engage in freaky magical person-stretching.) This painful-looking take on [Spatial Contortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spatial+Contortion) from Joseph Meehan is July's promo card, and it's ready to twist your opponent's creatures into oblivion—or your own into damage-dealing monstrosities!

**August**


As if you need another reason to side with the Eldrazi. Last month was [Spatial Contortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spatial+Contortion), this month is one of the best ways to cast it. Throw in a touch of colored mana, and you have a pretty versatile land with pretty art from one Jonas De Ro.
