Grand Prix Florence 2007
------------------------


Kaneko Dominates in Florence!
=============================




September 8-9, 2007











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpfir07/champ.jpg)Masami Kaneko is the Grand Prix Florence 2007 Champion!


After two long days in beautiful Firenze, Italy, Masami Kaneko can claim yet another Grand Prix Trophy for Japan. Not the predicted blue-black Teachings deck that dominated the swiss, but the blue-green aggro deck was what it took to win this title. And thus the *Time Spiral* Block season ends. Join us next month for some Limited action with the new Lorwyn set!
