**Build Notes**


**Gameplay**


* Cardset | Players resolving [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) may now properly deliberately fail to find a card when they have one or more cards in their hand.
* Duel Scene | Mana will once again be automatically consumed from a player’s pool in most circumstances. Mana will not be consumed if any of the mana has a rider associated with it, if the spell has a variable or alternate means of paying its cost (such as delve or convoke), or if the spell cannot be cast for exactly the mana in the player’s pool.
* Duel Scene | The functionality of the “No Possible Play: Yield All” option, associated with the keyboard shortcut F8 by default, has been restored.
* Duel Scene | Mana abilities of permanents that do not include a tap symbol no longer appear to cause the permanent to tap. Notably, this includes [Kozilek's Translator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Translator).
* Duel Scene | Keyboard shortcuts, such as “OK” (default: F2) or “Yield Until End of Turn” (default: F6), no longer sometimes cause blocking assignments to be reset.
* Duel Scene | Using the Undo keyboard shortcut (default: Ctrl+Z) during the declaration of blockers once again works as expected.
* Duel Scene | While a player is required to choose multiple permanents, using the Undokeyboard shortcut (default: Ctrl+Z) no longer reduces the number of permanents that player has to choose.
* Cardset | Spells that return multiple permanents from different zones to players' hands (such as Rise & Fall or [Æther Tradewinds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Tradewinds)) now work as expected.
* Duel Scene | Creatures that produce mana upon their death, such as [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion) or [Su-Chi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Su-Chi), will now provide players an opportunity to use that mana even if the player hasn’t set a stop for the step or phase in which the creature dies.
* Cardset | If [Winds of Qal Sisma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winds+of+Qal+Sisma) resolves while its controller also controls a creature with power 4 or greater, the Winds will now correctly protect planeswalkers from combat damage.
* Cardset | [Shrine of Boundless Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Boundless+Growth)'s activated ability now generates mana as expected.
* Commander | If a player generates mana outside of his or her commander’s color identity, that mana is no longer turned into colorless mana. This update brings the Commander format on *Magic Online* in line with the January 2016 rules change. Rejoice, sunburst and converge cards!
* Cardset | [Viscerid Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscerid+Drone) once again requires the sacrifice of a Swamp to activate either of its abilities.
* Cardset | Prompt box text associated with several cards has been corrected, including [Loam Larva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loam+Larva), [Archangel of Strife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Strife), and [Devour in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Flames).
* Cardset | Spells that require a specific color of mana to be spent on X, such as [Drain Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life), once again enforce that requirement.
* Cardset | Players can again choose to exile two cards from any single graveyard, not just their own, to activate the ability of [Night Soil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Soil).
* Cardset | [Chorus of the Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chorus+of+the+Conclave) static ability that allows a player to pay additional mana when casting a creature has been returned to expected functionality.
* Cardset | If [Auratouched Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratouched+Mage) leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the Aura will now be properly put into the player’s hand.
* Cardset | Players are once again required to pay all additional costs for [Primitive Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primitive+Justice).
* Cardset | Tokens created by [Forbidden Orchard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Orchard) no longer incorrectly appear to have flying.
* Cardset | Spells and abilities that allow a player to change the target(s) of a spell or ability, such as [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite)'s activated ability, can no longer be used to add a target to some spells and abilities. Notably, this includes *Oath of the Gatewatch*'s support mechanic.
* Cardset | If a creature enchanted by [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward) loses all abilities, that creature will now correctly lose the protection granted by [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward). A remaining display bug may cause the blue text indicating the protection ability to remain on the creature, but the card will function correctly.
* Cardset | [Oath of Chandra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Chandra)'s second triggered ability now correctly sees planeswalkers that entered the battlefield earlier in the turn even if that object is no longer a planeswalker when the ability would trigger. [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) is relieved.
* Cardset | [Wicker Warcrawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicker+Warcrawler) now receives the expected -1/-1 counter when it attacks or blocks.
* Cardset | A commander destroyed by [Necromantic Selection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necromantic+Selection) and returned to the command zone with the commander replacement effect can no longer be returned to the battlefield with [Necromantic Selection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necromantic+Selection)'s ability.
* Cardset | [Echoing Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay) affects only the one target creature when cast on a face-down creature. Face-down creatures have no name, and thus cannot share a name with anything.
* Cardset | [Tempting Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempting+Wurm) no longer tempts Magic Online into allowing the opponent to put cards onto the battlefield from another player’s library or hand.
* Cardset | [Heroes' Podium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroes%27+Podium) no longer provides a power and toughness boost to legendary creature cards in zones other than the battlefield.
* Cardset | A creature sacrificed with [Bloodfire Infusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodfire+Infusion)'s activated ability now correctly deals damage to each other creature.
* Cardset | Neither [Atarka, World Render](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%2C+World+Render) nor [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death) will now trigger their own abilities if, when they attack, they are no longer Dragons.
* Cardset | [Aven Mindcensor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor)'s third ability now interacts appropriately with all search effects.
* Cardset | Players can no longer start the game with [Gemstone Caverns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Caverns) on the battlefield if they’re playing first and have a Leyline or other start of game action in addition to the Caverns.
* Cardset | [Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) now properly displays its gained triggered ability in blue text (“When this creature becomes the target…”) when copying a creature, making it more clear that it will be sacrificed if targeted.
* Cardset | A visual indicator is now present when [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) redirects a spell or ability that targeted multiple permanents with the same name. When prompted to change targets, players should be alert for a green glow around the current target.
* Cardset | Each [Endbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endbringer) now properly untaps during other players’ untap steps. Except Shauku.
* Cardset | If a permanent would be destroyed, but has multiple Auras with totem armor on it, an Aura chosen by the creature’s controller will now be correctly destroyed instead.
* Cardset | Players are no longer incorrectly allowed to choose [Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wastes) when prompted to choose a basic land type. “Wastes” is not a land type; it is a basic land card without a basic land type.
* Cardset | Players can no longer choose a value of X higher than 0 when casting a spell with [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers)'s triggered ability.
* Cardset | Players can no longer tap noncreature permanents to pay the cost of Sky Hussar’s forecast ability.

**Look and Feel**


* Duel Scene | The prompt box no longer displays the incorrect color during the scry-like step during the mulligan process.
