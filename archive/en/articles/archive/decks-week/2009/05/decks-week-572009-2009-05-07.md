The first season of the **Magic Online** Championship Series has come and gone! A number of players battled to see who would come out on top, but in the end, only one earned the right to compete at the World Championships in Rome to be held this winter. Of course, there are plenty of more opportunities for *you* to qualify too! Get busy on **Magic Online** soon [to make the cut for the second season](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/031009a)!
