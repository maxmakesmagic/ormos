At the end of Day 2, it was announced that Grand Prix Boston-Worcester was just shy of 2400 players. The final count for this event was 2394, once preregistered no-shows were removed from the event reporting system.


However, multiple sources – including the coverage page for Grand Prix Boston-Worcester – stated that attendance was over 2400 at the start of Saturday. Because of this, players made decisions based on the prize payout that is assigned to Grand Prix with an attendance of 2400 or more players.


As information on the coverage page reported an attendance of over 2400 players, Wizards of the Coast has decided to award prizes down to 150th place, matching the prize structure for a 2400+ Grand Prix.
