**What's the most under or overrated card in *Magic 2015* Sealed?**

***Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:** "[Xathrid Slyblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Slyblade) is overrated. He looks like he's invincible, but every time you attack you hope they don't block because you have to spend so much mana on it. And there are so many cards, like [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm), that trade back the two damage or block it."*

***Neal Oliver:** "[Festergloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festergloom) is underrated. It's a really good card and I'm main-decking one today. In my last round I used it to kill my [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), his Mystic and [Netcaster Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Netcaster+Spider). Then I played a 10/10 [Undergrowth Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undergrowth+Scavenger)."*
