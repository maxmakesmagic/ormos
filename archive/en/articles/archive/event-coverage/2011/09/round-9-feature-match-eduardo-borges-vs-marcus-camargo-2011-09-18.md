Playing for almost a decade, Marcus Camargo is here in his first Nationals, and doing rather well at 7-1 with one round of draft to play. Having gone 2-1 with [Bant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant) Pod, he's playing now for the perfect draft record. So too is his 25 year old opponent Eduardo Borges. The Porto Allegre resident has played in half a dozen Nationals, and came closest to glory when finishing a heartbreaking 9th last year. Perhaps his mono-red deck can get him across the line this year. But first, that small matter of the 6-0 draft bragging rights...


### Game One


Camargo began with an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) into [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), leaving the cards on top. [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) was also Borges' first play, with [Alluring Siren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren) on turn two. Three [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s from Camargo, and pass. Three [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s from Borges, attack for one, and pass.


Now we headed towards a second color. [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) from Camargo led to a blue creature, [Aven Fleetwing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fleetwing). Borges had [Phantasmal Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Dragon), but [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web) punctured that illusion. The [Aven Fleetwing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fleetwing) attacked for two, with [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino) next for Camargo. Borges, still with just [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s in a deck that also wanted to use [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s, cast [Mind Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Unbound), but Camargo was ready with [Acidic Slime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) to take it out.

*Eduardo Borges*

The game continued to evolve, with Borges adding [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept), [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear), and [Lord of the Unreal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Unreal) to the board. Another [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear) followed. Meanwhile Camargo was replaying his [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino), bounced earlier by the [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept), and trading [Acidic Slime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) for [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept).


Then the game changed rather radically, with the arrival for Camargo of [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan). Not quite as much of a powerhouse as in [Valakut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut) decks, the 6/6 Trampler was still more than a little good. Thin two lands out of your deck, attack as a 6/6 Trampler, get two more lands out of your deck...


[Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) from Camargo bounced the [Lord of the Unreal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Unreal) back to hand, and his Aven piled in. Borges looked at the [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino), [Aven Fleetwing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fleetwing), and [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) across the table, and packed it in.


Camargo 1 - 0 Borges


### Game Two


It was a very different opening hand for Borges, who this time had [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s at his disposal. [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) was first, however, allowing a turn one [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear). [Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker) joined the rush on turn two, with Camargo casting [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion) off his two [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s. In came Borges for four, and he continued to curve out with a [Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370419)thirsty [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre). What a start!

*Marcus Camargo*

Camargo kept just one creature on the board, his [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion), choosing to equip it with [Trollhide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trollhide). Borges elected not to attack, adding [Alluring Siren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren) to the board. His [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre) met [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web) from Camargo, who passed back, neither side willing to take the initiative. With Borges apparently stalled, Camargo sent his [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion) into battle, following up with [Belltower Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx). A second [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear) from Borges wasn't going to get past an increasingly-impressive defense.


In came the Camargo team, with [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) bouncing, and therefore killing, a [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear). Camargo still wasn't done, with a second [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion) arriving on the scene. Borges drew for the turn, and extended the hand. He had begun the game with three good turns, but that was it. Still at 7-2, he was in with a shout of the top 8, but it was Camargo who managed a perfect 6-0 record in draft, taking him to 8-1, and possibly within one Standard win of the top 8.
