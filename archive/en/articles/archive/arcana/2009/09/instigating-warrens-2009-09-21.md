Let's take a look at Warren Instigator today. Here's the card, in case you haven't been keeping up on your *Zendikar* previews.

Okay, since this is **Magic** Arcana, we're more interested in the card's *flavor* at the moment than in the card's abilities. As you can see from the flavor text, this goblin is shouting at his cohorts to come out of their warrens. But can you see the warrens themselves? Let's blow that image up for a closer look!

There they are! They're a little hard to see at card size, but there are definitely goblin heads poking out from the cliff face at the top of the picture.
