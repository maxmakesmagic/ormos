*What's your favorite card from the* [Dark Ascension *Card Image Gallery*](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/darkascension/cig#)?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** First off, honorable mentions: Immerwolf not only serves as another Wolf/Werewolf lord that locks down Werewolves on their awesome side, but also has a pretty awesome name ("immer" means "always" in German); Zombie Apocalypse is *a zombie apocalypse* (and there are plenty of other awesome cards in the gallery as well).

For me personally, though, it's got to be Drogskol Reaver.

There are few things in **Magic** I enjoy more than drawing cards, and this seven-mana 3/5 weirdo lets me draw cards—potentially a *lot* of cards—in style. Not only does it fight like a dragon, dealing 6 damage even without any power-pumping, not only does it have lifelink, not only does it draw you two cards when it hits something (unless that something dies on the first hit, but hey, I'll take that too)... but it also happily hands you a card every time you gain life for any reason, from [Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane) to [Zedruu the Greathearted](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zedruu+the+Greathearted). With this scary Spirit on your side, drawing two extra cards a turn would be thinking *small*.
