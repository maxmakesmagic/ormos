Happy Holidays **Magic** Players! 


If you haven't heard, the [**Magic Online** Wide Beta](/en/articles/archive/wide-beta-new-magic-online-client-has-started-2012-09-04) has been up and running for just over three months and we have made a lot of progress so far, much of it based on your feedback. If you have already logged in to the Wide Beta and given us your thoughts, we thank you and hope that you will continue to do so as we continue development into the new year. 


With tomorrow's downtime, December 12, we are deploying another major Wide Beta update, much of which focuses on the Duel Scene, and we want you to let us know what you think. With the [**Magic Online** Cube: Holiday 2012](/en/articles/archive/magic-online-cube-holiday-2012-2012-11-27) just around the corner, we thought this weekend would be a great opportunity for players to earn some Cube Tickets just by checking out the changes.

That's right; you can earn Cube Tickets just by checking out the **Magic Online** Wide Beta this weekend. Here is how it works: 


* Log into the [new **Magic Online** Wide Beta client](/en/articles/archive/2011-10-17) any time between 6:00 AM PST on Friday, December 14, and 6:00 AM PST on Monday, December 17.
* If you meet the requirement above, we will automatically add four (4) Cube Tickets to your collection during the downtime on Wednesday, December 19.
* If, while using the **Magic Online** Wide Beta client during the time period stated above, you play in at least one (1) Constructed, Sealed Deck or Draft tournament that has at least eight (8) players, we will add an additional six (6) Cube Tickets to your account during the downtime on Wednesday, December 19. As long as the event started during the time period stated above and you meet the play requirement stated above, you will qualify for the additional Cube Tickets.
* Please note that each **Magic Online** account can earn a maximum of ten (10) Cube Tickets during this period.

We are very excited by our progress with the new **Magic Online** so far, but we still need your help. After you are done playing in the new **Magic Online**, make sure you take a couple minutes and [fill out our Wide Beta survey](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1112822/MTGO-Wide-Beta-Survey-2-December-11-2012) and [join the conversation in our forums](http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/view/75846/135046/Magic_Online_General).


Thank you for all of your effort so far and see you in the game,   
 The **Magic Online** Team
