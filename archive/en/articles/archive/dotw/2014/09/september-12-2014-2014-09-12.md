A total of 878 players descended onto Salt Lake City, Utah, last weekend for the [last Grand Prix to feature *Magic 2015*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpslc14). In the set's last big hurrah before *Khans of Tarkir*, some of the game's top players performed brilliantly all weekend. The final draft of the weekend featured 7th-ranked Paul Rietzl in his tenth Grand Prix Top 8 and 9th-ranked player Eric Froehlich in his career twelfth Grand Prix Top 8.



In the end, however, it was Grand Prix mainstay Brandon Nelson who won the whole thing, after a series of Top 8 near misses over the last few years. Nelson's career Grand Prix win rate finally paid off last weekend, earning him the trophy.



Meanwhile, the new Pro Tour Qualifier season featuring Sealed Deck with Top 8 Booster Draft is underway. *Magic 2015* is finishing out its run in the PTQ season this weekend. Next weekend is *Khans of Tarkir* Prereleases, and after that, the new set will take center stage in PTQs worldwide. Winners in this PTQ season will earn themselves airfare and invitations to Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* in Washington DC, so be sure to find a PTQ near you and maybe we'll see you in February 2015!
