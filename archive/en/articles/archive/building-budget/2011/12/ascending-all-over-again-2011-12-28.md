*My [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) decks have garnered a lot of attention since last October when I first unveiled the new and powerful combo strategy. [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) had lost a lot of thunder with the rotation of [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp). This column successfully created a [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) deck that worked well in the new Standard format.*

*However, the most significant information here had nothing to do with [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). This column was, to my knowledge, the first public realization of the [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) / [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combo. This combo ended up being one of the most powerful forces in Standard until [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) rotated. Even now, [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) / [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) remains one of the premier combo decks of the Modern format.*

  
The *New Phyrexia* Prerelease is this weekend! The full [Card Image Gallery](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/newphyrexia/spoiler) is up now, and the whole **Magic** community is abuzz. I was fortunate enough to spend about twenty-six hours in a car this last weekend with Nathan Pease, Nick Spagnolo, Gerard Fabiano, and Lew Laskin. We went through the New Phyrexia spoiler and discussed powerful interactions between the cards available.

The Prerelease is an excellent place to make friends and a wonderful first chance to play with cards that haven't even been released yet. Those of you who follow the demand of cards know how coveted some of the cards from the new set are. Foil [Mental Misstep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep)s can probably be traded for any Standard-legal card other than [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). There are a lot of new cards that are just waiting to be broken. Playing with the new cards is also a great chance to learn how powerful particular cards might be. I've been to a lot of Prereleases expecting specific cards to be mediocre only to be pleasantly surprised by how powerful they were.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab141_ascension.jpg)  
It's important to try and be proactive when approaching a new format. Control decks that win with card advantage and reactive cards need to know what they're reacting to. It's difficult to predict a metagame before any tournaments have been played. Decks like Blue-Black Control may end up being very powerful, but they're difficult to build when you're still unsure what you're trying to beat.

As many of you might expect, I'm looking forward to the return of [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) as a promising deck for Standard. I've always been a Johnny; I would always rather play a combo deck than control or aggro. *New Phyrexia* introduces a handful of powerful new tools for a Pyromancer.

The first of these new tools is [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe). [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) based strategies took a huge hit when [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) rotated out of standard with [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp). Having two one mana cantrips makes ascending a lot easier. I'm not sure if [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) is as powerful as ponder in a vacuum, but it certainly increases the power level of your very good draws.

| Pyromancer Ascension | Gitaxian Probe |

[Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) allows a careful Pyromancer to ascend in such a way as to play around every interaction an opponent can muster. I recommend saving [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) until you're ready to make a move. You get to see your opponent's hand and, as a result, you can carefully play around every [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), and [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim).

I'll explain the goal and strategy of the [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) deck for those who might be unfamiliar with its inner workings.

[Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) plays a lot of inexpensive card draw spells that serve double duty. The cheap card draw lets a Pyromancer find the deck's namesake enchantment early enough for it to matter. Once you've found the enchantment, the cheap card draw is exactly what you need to get two counters on [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension).

You're not in a hurry to "combo" people when playing [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). The deck has all the tools it needs to play a careful control game and "turn on" the Ascension at a key point so it can take over the game. You would be surprised how difficult it becomes to lose when you're copying cards like [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and [See Beyond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond). The card advantage created by your enchantment makes it very difficult for any opponent to win the game. Once you have an active [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), you can quickly sift through your deck until you find a copy of [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind). [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) has a powerful and interesting interaction with the enchantment. Copying [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) essentially gives you four spells. Burning out an opponent is quite easy once the Ascension becomes active.

![Call to Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Call+to+Mind)  
When building a Pyromancer deck it's important to play four of most cards. Redundancy is rewarded here because the enchantment requires you to draw spells in multiples. Cards with higher mana costs can be played as less than four-ofs, but that's only because it's difficult and oftentimes awkward when you're trying to activate a [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) with any card that costs more than two mana.

I get a lot of emails about [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) in which people send me their lists and ask me to make suggestions. There are many pitfalls that a deckbuilder must avoid when working on their [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) deck.

It's difficult to do, but you have to strip yourself of all your worldly possessions. Creatures, artifacts, and non-[Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) enchantments are unplayable in this type of strategy. If you intend on winning with [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) then you really need to move all-in on this type of strategy. Cards that don't work to trigger your Ascension are clunky and lead to difficult or bad draws.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab141_exarch.jpg)  
Many players have begun to include the [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) / [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) combo, for example. ([Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) lets [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) tap to create copy of [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), which can untap the original, which can tap to create another copy. Rinse and repeat until an arbitrarily large number of hasty 1/4s crash into the red zone.) This combo is very powerful, but I don't think it has a place in [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) strategies. Again, playing eight cards that don't work to power up your Ascension leaves you in a lot of situations wherein you cannot get the [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) online or you don't have any worthwhile spells to copy once you have the Ascension out and active. I believe that [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) decks will find most of their success when they splash black and play some combination of [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek).



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Splinter Twin | Deceiver Exarch |

That being said, I do feel that Pyromancer decks want the [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) / [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) combo in their sideboards. It's important to have access to something like this because it puts opponents in awkward spots where they don't know whether or not they can side out their removal. I probably wouldn't even sideboard in the combo against most players, but the presence of these cards in my sideboard will force my opponent to play suboptimal or completely dead cards, even in the second and third games.

Another common pitfall that deckbuilders encounter when building [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) is not including enough card draw. It's extremely difficult to activate your enchantment if you're not playing enough card draw spells. Also, once you have the Ascension active, card draw spells are the most powerful thing you can cast. A cheap, simple cantrip becomes an absolutely broken "draw two" for one mana. The card draw spells chain into one another until you happen upon enough burn / countermagic to lock up the game.

Would-be Pyromancers need to make tough decisions on their last few slots, but the skeleton of the deck is straightforward. I think you need to play four copies of [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [See Beyond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond), [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), and [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning). Once you add a few copies of [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind), you really don't have a lot of room to work with. I like playing a few [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee). Once you have an active [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), a single [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) is going to find all the tools you need. [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) was a valuable addition before the rotation, but [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) makes it a lot less exciting.

Personally, I think [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) is going to gain a lot of value from the new set. [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) is strong against [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) / [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), planeswalkers, and Swords. [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) favorably interacts with every deck except the most aggressive [Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) decks. [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) is also an exceptional tool. It's important to prevent your opponent from sticking something like [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). Jace is the only card that has a chance of keeping up with your draw-go game. [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) is also valuable when attempting to protect your Ascension.

[Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) is quickly going to become a format staple. I expect that the new metagame will feature combo decks that rely on enchantments, [Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) aggro decks, and [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) decks. [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) is a powerful tool against all of these decks. I'm not particularly confident in the strength of decks like Green-Blue-Black and Blue-Red-Green after rotation, but [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) is a small glimmer of hope.

![Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nature%27s+Claim)  
I fully expect [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) to regularly appear in people's main decks within the next few weeks. I suggest adding [Mental Misstep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep)s to the [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) sideboard in an effort to deal with this. [Mental Misstep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep) is a powerful tool that a Pyromancer can sideboard against a lot of different hate. [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) and [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) were always very strong against [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), and [Mental Misstep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep) helps us stick an Ascension underneath our opponent's discard or protects the enchantment from [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim)s once on the battlefield.

![Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mental+Misstep)  
[Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) aggro decks have gotten a lot more powerful with the introduction of *New Phyrexia*. You can read about the [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) version of the deck in the column I wrote [last week](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/porcelain-perfection-2011-04-27). It's important that we give this deck the amount of credit it deserves. If we skimp on sideboard hate then it's very possible that we just get run over by them. [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) seems to be the best option available in Standard.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Mox Opal | Pyroclasm |

I don't recommend just tapping out for a [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) unless you're getting absurd card advantage or are about to die. You need to leave countermagic open to stop [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) from hitting the battlefield. A resolved [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) makes all of their creatures a lot scarier; they hit harder and they outclass [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm). Again, I want the full playset of [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) in the sideboard here. It's unlikely we can beat the dedicated [Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) aggro decks if we don't give ourselves as much of a chance as we can to draw our [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm)s in Games 2 and 3.

Now that we've discussed all the different angles you can approach [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) builds from, I'd like to show you the budget list I would recommend.

This list is clean and polished. It's ready to play the moment you get your hands on [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe)s, [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch)s, and [Mental Misstep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep)s.

It's worth noting just how exciting the new set is. Caw-Blade seemed to have a tight stranglehold on the format, and beating it meant you had to make your deck weak to aggressive decks and tap-out decks like [Valakut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut) and Blue-Red-Green.

*New Phyrexia* changes everything, though. Standard is about to be a wonderfully diverse metagame. Aggressive strategies are going to receive huge bonuses like [Porcelain Legionnaire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire), [Hex Parasite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hex+Parasite), and [Mental Misstep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep) out of the sideboard. Tezzeret control decks will have access to [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb), a card that allows them to beat Caw-Blade–style decks in a normal card-advantage war. Combo decks are being upgraded beyond anything I could have imagined.

There's even room for innovation. Lew Laskin wants to play [Awakening Zone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening+Zone) and [Fresh Meat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fresh+Meat) alongside each other. Think about it; you can sacrifice all your Eldrazi Spawn and cast [Fresh Meat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fresh+Meat). The Eldrazi Spawn will fuel your mana so you don't even have to worry about tapping out. With a healthy amount of card draw and counterspells, you can do some really impressive things with your opponent's end step.

Next week I'll be able to play some test games now that the cards will be available. I know a lot of you love that part of the column and, unfortunately, it just isn't possible to play games with cards that don't exist.

I hope you all enjoyed this exploration of [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) in the new Standard. If you haven't found out where your nearest Prerelease is, then I'd be sure to check while you're here on **MagicTheGathering.com**. I will be slinging cards at the Prerelease at Reality's Edge in North Arlington, New Jersey this coming weekend.

Happy brewing!
