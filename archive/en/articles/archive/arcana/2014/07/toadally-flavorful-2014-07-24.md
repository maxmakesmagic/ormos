Bonnie Bruenderman is a visual designer for DailyMTG. The authors write the articles; the editors edit; then she gets to add cards, images, funnies, charts, graphs... whatever the article needs above and beyond the text. She has a very nerdy sense of humor. (Someday, her illustrated mutant amalgamations shall take over the Multiverse! Patience, my pet. Patience.....) 






*Magic* is a serious game. It's competitive. It's strategic. It takes itself very seriously.


It has frogs! \*squee\*


What I'm saying is *Magic* is something different to everyone. Creative and R&D know that. They do their best to pepper the cards with little tidbits that, mechanically or flavorfully, will appeal to each of us. I love a lot of things about *Magic 2015*, but the quirky thing that stuck out to me was the frogs!


How many frogs in M15? Let's take a look!


First is the obvious:

[Turn to Frog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog) | Art by [Warren Mahy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Warren%20Mahy%22%5D)


Not a new piece of art, but a great one. I love the coloring and the sense of story. From the positioning of the frog and the clothes we know exactly what just happened. Poor guy. Then again, maybe life's better as a frog?


Then we have [Turn to Frog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog)'s big brother:


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Polymorphist's%20Jest)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorphist's%20Jest)
![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/cardart/cardart_polymorphistsjest.jpg)
[Polymorphist's Jest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorphist%27s+Jest) | Art by [Craig J Spearing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Craig%20J%20Spearing%22%5D)


I love powerful female characters. And [Jalira, Master Polymorphist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jalira%2C+Master+Polymorphist) is one I'm really excited about and hope to get more backstory for. That she has a great sense of humor just makes it that much better. This art is great, too—good sense of depth and air, lots of motion and action without being busy—it's a nice piece. It doesn't hurt that hover-frog back there always makes me laugh.


And lastly, unless I missed one—tweet at me if I missed one!—although technically a toad:

[Witch's Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witch%27s+Familiar) | Art by [Jack Wang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Jack%20Wang%22%5D)


I love this art! Only Jack Wang could paint a toad that looks like you must kneel before it. He has a particular talent of painting the ferociously amphibious. For your consideration, although not part of M15, we have:

And for those curious, here's a (probably incomplete) collection of other frogs in *Magic*.
