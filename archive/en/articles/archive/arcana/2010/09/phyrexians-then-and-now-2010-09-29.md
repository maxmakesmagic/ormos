We've spent a few [recent](/en/articles/archive/know-your-myr-2010-09-20) [Arcanas](/en/articles/archive/copperhorn-2010-09-27) looking at how the world of Mirrodin has changed between the days of *Mirrodin* and *Scars of Mirrodin*. But how about the Phyrexians?


Well, let's take a look at some cards from [Phyrexia vs. the Coalition](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/phyrexiavsthecoalition/productinfo) and contrast them with cards in *Scars of Mirrodin*. That sounds fun, right?

If you'd like to know more about the Phyrexian incursion into Mirrodin, [the Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#world) has much to show you.
