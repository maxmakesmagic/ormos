Boros Legion
**My Army. My Aggression. My Guild.**
The Boros Legion is the guild of righteous law and fierce justice. The most formidable military force on Ravnica, the Boros are efficient, self-assured, and zealous in the pursuit of their ideals. The Boros believe passionately in law; to them it is the structure by which society functions and the road map for the community’s health and safety. Anything that violates the letter of the law, threatens the spirit of the law, or obstructs the enforcement of the law is considered an enemy of the Boros Legion. In effect, anyone who disagrees with the Boros is an enemy of the Boros.

**Aurelia: the Belligerence behind the Boros.** The current guild leader is Aurelia, a ferocious archangel who ascended through the Boros ranks. After the death of Razia, founder of the Boros, and the disgrace of Feather, the previous angel guildmaster, the warleader Aurelia challenged Feather’s ascendancy. Aurelia argued that a disgraced angel couldn’t command authority or respect, and many agreed. Aurelia quickly shamed into silence those who didn’t support her, and she soon took command of the guild. While Razia was more of a figurehead, aloof and untouchable, Aurelia is an active, forceful leader who is directly involved with her underlings. She has urged the Boros to adopt her impassioned ideals and to take action to enforce them.

Illus. Slawomir Maniak
**Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion.** Sunhome is the central guildhall of the Boros, acting as fortress, barracks, and place of worship. Widely believed to be a nearly impregnable monolith, Sunhome is a symbol of the Boros Legion’s strength and unity. In the past, Sunhome was the base of operations for the Wojek division of the guild, but the new guild leader Aurelia moved the Wojek to a secondary base and concentrated the strength of the Legion army at Sunhome.
