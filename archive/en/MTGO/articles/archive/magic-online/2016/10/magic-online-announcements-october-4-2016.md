**Upcoming *Kaladesh* Streamer Showdown on October 7**


If you've never seen a Streamer Showdown before, they come in two eight-player pods that feature some of the best streamers in the community brawling with the latest *Magic Online* sets, Cubes, and Flashback Drafts. If you're trying to improve your game, *Magic Online* streamers are some of the best players out there—and some of the best teachers, too. Even if you're already a *Magic* pro, throw your support behind one of the competitors and cheer them on from their Twitch chat!

**Qualifier Point Switchover Incoming**


Now that 2016 *Magic Online* Championship Series (MOCS) Qualifier Events are wrapping up, we'll begin the transition into awarding Qualifier Points (QPs) for the 2017 MOCS. QPs for the 2016 MOCS will be removed from collections during the Wednesday, October 5, downtime. In the meantime, QPs for the 2016 season can be sorted within the Collection Scene by applying the "Qualifier Points" filter.


For the 2017 MOCS, we’ll be using a generic Qualifier Point that doesn’t list a particular season on it (like we’ve been using “Season 1” for 2016. Since there is only one Qualifier Point object as of October 5, we’ll be removing “Qualifier Points” as a collection filter with that downtime. The new Qualifier Point object can be found in the “Tickets” filter.

**Updating *Magic Online* Operating System Requirements**


Unfortunately, an infrastructure update on September 21 makes Windows Vista SP2 incompatible with *Magic Online*—the [requirements page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/download) has been updated to reflect this change. In order to resolve this issue, you’ll need to upgrade to Windows 7 or higher.
