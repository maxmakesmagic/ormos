Magic at Gen Con 2019
=====================



 Posted in **Feature**
 on July 24, 2019

By Gavin Verhey




 When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he dreamt of a job making Magic cards—and now as a Magic designer, he's living his dream! Gavin has been writing about Magic since 2005. 






In 1993, *Magic* showed up at Gen Con. The convention was one of the first places *Magic* debuted—it made a huge impact on the show and began its quick ascent to become a beloved game like no other.


Now 26 years later, *Magic* is still making a huge impact at Gen Con!


I'm incredibly excited to be coming to the show for my tenth Gen Con, and this year, *Magic* is doing some pretty big stuff.


You want to play competitively? Well, we've got qualifiers all weekend leading up to a truly one-of-a-kind event that will surely generate plenty of chatter.


Art and story more your thing? Well, how about live painting with some of *Magic*'s great artists!


Would you prefer to focus on Commander? We have panels, play space, and even the Commander Rules Committee around!


Oh, and did I mention there will be *Commander (2019 Edition)* preview cards? That's right—previews for *Commander 2019* kick off at Gen Con!


And that's just the tip of the [Iceberg Cancrix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iceberg+Cancrix)! I'll be your host for much of the weekend, moderating a good chunk of our panels and hanging around for many events. In fact, there's going to be tons of excellent Wizards and *Magic* luminaries there, and I'd like to show you pictures of several of us as we go along so you know who to look for. As you see us, feel free to stop us and say hi! For example, here's me:

Now, let me run through what you can expect.


The Commander Connection
========================


I'm the Commander architect here at Wizards, and that means I'm always thinking about neat things we can do with Commander. Conventions are no exception—and I worked along with Chris Tulach, our events team, and many others at Wizards to craft a pretty exciting lineup!



![Chris Tulach](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/DESDEVPHOTO_Tulach.png)*Chris Tulach*
First of all, this is where *Commander (2019 Edition)* previews kick off! We have three Commander panels throughout the weekend, and each one of them will feature some brand-new cards! It all begins at 6 p.m. ET on Thursday, as I walk through Commander with three members of its design team: Ethan Fleischer, Mike Turian, and Scott Larabee!


Then, on Friday, we have a real treat for you. You may have heard a lot about the Commander Rules Committee, the people who manage Commander: Sheldon Menery, Scott Larabee, Gavin Duggan, and Toby Elliott. But being spread out across North America, they pretty much are never all at an event together.


But Gen Con is a pretty special place. And, for the first time in as long as I can remember, all four of them will be at an event together!



![alt text](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/QgRSCUYi5B.jpg)*Seldon Menery*

![alt text](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/CP20180724_Larabee.png)*Scott Larabee*

![alt text](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/VUOetCS2XE.jpg)*Gavin Duggan*

![alt text](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/889B9KOqkL.jpg)*Toby Elliot*
So, we're bringing them together for a panel—hosted by yours truly—plus some preview cards to showcase as well. I am so excited to have them all in one place and can't wait to see them all play a game together at some point. That'll be a spectacle for sure!


Finally, if you want to hop on the Commander bandwagon, come visit our panel on Saturday about how to build a new Commander deck, where me, Scott Larabee, Sheldon Menery, and Ethan Fleischer will talk about how you might do it—using some brand-new legends!


And, of course, on top of all this *Commander 2019* and panel goodness, there will be plenty of Commander happening around the hall all weekend. Feel free to join events or just play casual games. It's going to be a blast, and I'll be playing with you there!


Cube for Keeps
==============


Yes, you read that right.


Cube Draft is many players' favorite format, where you draft from a powerful pool of many of *Magic*'s strongest cards. Normally, a cube is curated by someone and then you have to give back your mix of dual lands, mythic rares, and hard-to-find cards from days long past. Because if you got to keep them, it would be ridiculous, right?


Well, exactly. So we're doing just that!


This is the Mythic Convention Series, and there are eight trial qualifiers in a variety of formats across Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. The winner of each qualifies for the big event on Sunday: a Cube draft where you get to keep the cards.


But it's not just about those cards. This is a Big Deal. On the line for the winner? A sealed booster box of *Legends* and an invite to Mythic Championship VI in Richmond this November.


Yes, that's right—you could be the one to qualify for the Mythic Championship through Cube Draft.


For everybody playing along at home, this final is also going to be livestreamed to the world beginning at 9 a.m. ET on Sunday, August 4, on [twitch.tv/gencon](https://www.twitch.tv/gencon) and [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Follow along and check it out!


And speaking of playing along at home to celebrate this, the *Legacy Cube* is coming to *Magic* *Online*! Although you don't get to keep those cards, it still brings the fun of the Cube experience into your home. You can check more about this out [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-online-legacy-cube-returns-time-gen-con-2019-07-17).


Finally, Cube is one of my favorite formats, and I wanted to invite a few Cube aficionados to chat about the format—so if you want to learn more about Cube or ask questions, come join me and community members Justin Parnell and Matt Kranstuber for our panel on Saturday as we chat about Cube. (More on panels in just a moment.)

Interested in joining? You can go learn more about these events over on the [Pastimes website](http://www.pastimes.net/).


Savor the Flavor
================


*Magic* has such rich art and story, and we wanted to make sure to bring that to life as well!


Creative Director Jess Lanzillo and Creative Producer Meris Mullaley will be out and about at Gen Con. They're both absolutely incredible, with great minds for the deep worlds and flavor *Magic* has to offer! Keep an eye out for them on the show floor, and feel free to say hi.

Each night, we'll also have a live painting event where artists use a cosplayer as a model to create a brand-new piece right in front of your eyes!


We also have a variety of D&D games featuring a mix of well-known players across our *Magic* planes. Join us as things get planeshifted. Anything and everything can happen!


Maybe you want to hear about how we mechanically returned to one of our fan-favorite planes. Well, we have a panel for that too, as we detail how we designed the first return to Dominaria in over a decade with designers Ethan Fleischer and Melissa DeTora.

And last, but certainly not least, is our cosplayers panel, where top cosplayers take you through the process for creating their incredible costumes. See what it takes for some of your favorite characters to come to life!
