Since "Prison" decks aren't very fun to play against, it's no surprise why cards like [Smokestack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokestack) or [Trinisphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere) don't show up often. However, Modern offers a wide, diverse card pool where (almost) anything is possible.



![Ghostly Prison](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ghostly%20Prison&options=)

Cards like [Ghostly Prison](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Prison) and [Suppression Field](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suppression+Field) have showed up as hate cards from time to time, but I haven't actually seen every hate card jammed into a single deck until now. Some pieces might be ineffective against certain archetypes, but that's all right when your cards are all bombs in the right matchup. [Idyllic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Idyllic+Tutor) happens to find the right hate card when you need it.


This deck suffers from the fact that you might draw the wrong piece at the wrong time, but when everything is going right, it's your opponent who's going to suffer. With a late game that features [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) fueling [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)s and a horde of Angels courtesy of [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne), at least your opponents won't be suffering for long!
