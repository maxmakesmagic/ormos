 "[Interpret the Signs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Interpret+the+Signs)—is that the six-mana sorcery, scry-three thing that draws cards?" Matt Sperling asked as he looked over Andrew Brown's Blue-Black Control decklist. The two settled into the Finals table and readied for the crowning match.



Brown answered yes, and the two hashed out the exact wording. Sperling said, "Oh yeah, I know it. Gabriel Nassif is always trying to play it in our testing. He'll be real happy."


The two continued shuffling. Sperling was just itching for a Grand Prix win. He had nary a loss on his record yet, cruising into the Top 8 with 41 points—then handily won his Quarter- and Semi-finals opponents.


"Hope it goes better than last time." Brown said as he presented his deck. These two met in the Swiss rounds, and it didn't go too well for Brown. But Brown had stuff on the line too. His roommate Edward Hwang was Grand Prix Orlando champ, and Brown didn't want him to be the only one in the house with a trophy.



 Brown told me before the match that Sperling's deck is more prepared than Mackl's version which he met and dismantled in the semi-finals. "I need [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) or [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) in my opening hand, and he has four [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). It's not the best." As he continued to look over the list he said, "Oh, but his sideboard's not as good as Mackl's was. [Sperling] has like no additional threats to bring in. Maybe this could be good."



The two presented the decks and began the match.



**The Games**




 Just as Brown wasn't hoping, Matt Sperling opened with a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). Brown had [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight), [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), and lands to show, and Sperling took the [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), betting that his awareness of the black cards would be enough to play around them.
