**Card of the Day - lundi 31 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shuriken)#### Shuriken


 *Betrayers of Kamigawa* uncommon. This card is a great example of "top-down" design, where the designers start with a flavor-based concept first and then design a card to match. Another good example of this approach is Form of the Dragon. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 28 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Forked-Branch%20Garami)#### Forked-Branch Garami


 *Betrayers of Kamigawa* uncommon. Though we weren't able to verify it 100%, we're all pretty sure this is the first **Magic** card to have a keyword ability repeated twice in a row in this functional fashion. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 27 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Genju%20of%20the%20Realm)#### Genju of the Realm


 *Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. Called "Spirit of the Mountain" during design, this wasn't part of a cycle at first. However, the effect was so popular that it led to a six card cycle. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 26 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goblin%20Cohort)#### Goblin Cohort


 *Betrayers of Kamigawa* common. Counting strictly non-wall creatures (so spells like Cinder Wall or Sarcomancy wouldn't count), Red has more 2+ power creatures for 1 mana than any other color. Green comes in second at 8, with Black bringing up third at 7. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 25 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Blazing%20Shoal)#### Blazing Shoal


 *Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. With modern sets it's quite rare to see a card that allows for first turn kills in Standard, but pulling it off with this one takes enough cards that R&D was willing to let it see print anyway.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 24 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mirror%20Gallery)#### Mirror Gallery


 *Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. Four different designers submitted ideas similar to this for the Kamigawa block. The one that made it into the development file was originally a land that had no drawback and also tapped for a colorless mana. Needless to say this turned out to be just a little too good. It was then changed to an artifact costing ![2 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_2_mana.gif), but even that proved to be problematic. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 21 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mistform%20Ultimus)#### Mistform Ultimus


 *Legions* rare. The smallest font on any **Magic** card is the legal text on Who/What/When/Where/Why, which is 2 point. To show all the creature types currently on Mistform Ultimus would take around .40 point... click here to see which you like better!
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 20 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mistform%20Ultimus)#### Mistform Ultimus


 *Legions* rare. Being every creature type ever printed leads to some pretty whacky scenarios. For example, Mistform Ultimus is the only goblin that forces you to sacrifice your Goblins of the Flarg. It's also infamous around the office for constantly monkeying around with trivia questions like "how many non-flying dragons are there?"
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 19 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mistform%20Ultimus)#### Mistform Ultimus


 *Legions* rare. During the design of *Legions* there was one mistform creature that became all creature types for ![1 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif). The result turned out to be so interesting that the ability was instead set to be always active, with no cost. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 18 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mistform%20Ultimus)#### Mistform Ultimus


 *Legions* rare. One of the many quirks of Mistform Ultimus is that he's the only flagbearer that doesn't actually have the flagbearer ability. And yet, as long as there's at least one other flagbearer in play, he basically gets the ability anyway!
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 17 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mistform%20Ultimus)#### Mistform Ultimus


 *Legions* rare. With the addition of *Betrayers*, Mistform Ultimus is now a Mutant Ninja Turtle. **Magic** doesn't have any cards with creature type "Teenage" but thanks to Boris Devilboon, Mistform Ultimus is a Minor. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 14 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Night%20of%20Soul's%20Betrayal)#### Night of Soul's Betrayal


 *Champions of Kamigawa* rare.  
 During development this card was actually non-legendary, but it proved to be too powerful in multiples. The legendary subtype was added just five days into the development cycle. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 13 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vicious%20Betrayal)#### Vicious Betrayal


 *Fifth Dawn* common.  
 One of the ways black and white mirror each other in **Magic** is that white is willing to sacrifice itself to help others. Black, as demonstrated on this card, prefers to sacrifice others to help itself. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 12 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Betrayal%20of%20Flesh)#### Betrayal of Flesh


 *Mirrodin* uncommon.  
 Conceived as a kind of yin/yang card, the idea was to find two effects that were opposite but related, both of which could make sense within the context of the card's color. In this case, both destroying a creature and reanimating it are well within black's flavor. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 11 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Murderous%20Betrayal)#### Murderous Betrayal


 *Nemesis* rare.   
 Payment of "half your life" is a price black mages should be quite familiar with. In fact, six other cards have been printed with this drawback: Cruel Bargain, Death Wish, Doomsday, Ebonblade Reaper, Infernal Contract, and Lurking Evil. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 10 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Betrayal)#### Betrayal


 *Visions* common.  
 Printed way back in *Visions*, this is still the only Enchant Creature ever printed that can only be played on a creature an opponent controls. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 7 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Treetop%20Village)#### Treetop Village


 *Urza's Legacy* uncommon.  
 In its early days tournament players often referred to the Village as "Bobtown." "Bob" was an acronym for "Beats On Blue," since the Village was effectively a 3/3 creature that cannot be countered. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 6 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Terror)#### Terror

 Alpha common.  
 The art for this card was submitted with the dimensions reversed. Jesper Myrfors, the art director for Alpha, just turned the art sideways. He thought it looked cool and kept it that way.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 5 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mirari)#### Mirari


 *Odyssey* rare.   
 Though players may take it for granted now, "the stack" wasn't part of the game until the *Sixth Edition* rules changes. Mirari was the first **Magic** card to mention the stack in its rules text. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 4 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gloom)#### Gloom


 *Alpha* uncommon.   
Did you know that the original version of this spell only affected the activated abilities of Circles of Protection? Starting with Beta the wording was changed to affect all white enchantments with activated abilities. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 3 janvier 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rootwalla)#### Rootwalla


 *Tempest* common.  
 This card was originally named Chuckwalla after a real lizard. The artist, Roger Raupp, thought the term was made up and drew his own fantasy lizard. The naming team was then forced to change the name as it was no longer a chuckwalla.
