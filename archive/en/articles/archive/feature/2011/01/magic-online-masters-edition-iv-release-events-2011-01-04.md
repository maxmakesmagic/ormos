Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for the *Masters Edition IV* Release Events Championship, players are not permitted to have more than one of their accounts entered in any single event at one time. Players are not permitted to have any accounts entered in events played by other players for any reason. If a player is discovered to have more than 1 account playing in a Championship before, during, or after the event, Wizards may take action against that player's account(s), up to and including disqualification with no refund of product and/or event tickets, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s). 

 Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the**Magic Online** User Agreeement. If you play in these, win, and expect to get your prize, be very sure you are playing on your own account. We do not recognize excuses, such as "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-17 to play on an account that adult has established.

It will be the player's responsibility to make sure that they have been properly entered into this event and are able to join it PRIOR to the start of the Championship. If a player is qualified and is unable to join the Championship, they will need to contact customer service for assistance.

**For all *Masters Edition IV* Release Events, **Wizards of the Coast** reserves the right to modify, reschedule, and/or delete any tournament if, in its sole judgment, tournament integrity has been compromised by an unforeseen technical issue.**
