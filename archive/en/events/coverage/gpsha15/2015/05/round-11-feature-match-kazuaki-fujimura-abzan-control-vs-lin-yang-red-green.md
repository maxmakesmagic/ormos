Coming into the second day of Grand Prix Shanghai there were three players sitting with a perfect 9-0 record. After round 10 there were only two: Kazuaki Fujimura and Lin Yang. By the end of this round, there will be only one.


Grand Prix Shizuoka top 8 competitor, Kazuaki Fujimura, was looking to improve on his previous 5th place finish this weekend. Throughout yesterday, Fujimura could be seen with a smile on his face crushing opponent after opponent with [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s. Different from the popular Abzan aggro decks, Fujimura opted for a more controlling version of Abzan, featuring 3 maindeck copies of [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) along with [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate) and [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon).


His opponent, Lin Yang, ran the tables thus far with Red Green Devotion. Similar to the deck Hugo Diniz used last weekend in Paris, Lin was running 4 maindeck copies of [See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten). This allowed him to sneak early [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka)s and [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen)s into play thus far in Shanghai.


The Games
=========


Both players had an ideal start for their decks. Fujimura started with a [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) while Lin began with [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix).


Fujimura's [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) revealed a hand full of threats; he opted to take a [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental), leaving a [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) behind.


Lin's [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) quickly found him a number of lands, and, while Fujimura had a [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) to buy back [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), Lin drew a second copy of his dragonlord.

It didn't take long for Lin to cast [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka). When he did, he wiped Fujimura's board. Not having an answer to the 8/8, Fujimura conceded one turn later.



**Lin 1 - 0 Fujimura**



In game 2, Lin started with a risky keep: a two land hand with a lot of power, but only [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) as a third mana source.


Fujimura punished Lin's decision on the first turn by casting [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and removing the [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic).


Without access to another mana source, Fujumura had free reign over Lin. He began with a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and quickly cast a pair of [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s.

When Lin was unable to find a third land, Fujimura's army of rhinos quickly sent the match to a third game.



**Lin 1 - 1 Fujimura**



The third game began without much excitement; Fujimura began with a [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) while Lin had a pair of [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix)es. Fujimura had answers for both, however, with a pair of [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price)s.


Lin's first big play of the game was a [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker). Fujimura made his [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) Monstrous and attacked away the planeswalker, but it left behind a 4/4 Mountain.


Having this 4/4 was really important for Lin. On the following turn he cast a Ferocious [See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten), which netted him a [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) and [Dragonlord Dromoka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Dromoka).


Fujimura found an answer for the Dragonlord in the form of [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion), but Lin untapped and cast another [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen).


Staring down a pair of [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen)s and a board full of insects, Fujimura had one turn to find an answer. He used a pair of [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm)s to draw some cards and eventually found a [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight). He used it to wipe away the insects.


Lin continued the pressure with a [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) on the following turn. Fujimura was able to find a [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate), but it wasn't enough. Thanks to [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental), Lin was able to replace his board with an army of 2/2s and attack for the win on the following turn.



**Lin Yang defeats Kazuaki Fujimura 2-1 and remains undefeated at Grand Prix Shanghai!**
