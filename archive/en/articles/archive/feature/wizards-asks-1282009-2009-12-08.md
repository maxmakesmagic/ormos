*When you play MiniMaster (a.k.a. Pack Wars)—opening a booster, shuffling in some basic lands, and playing—how many of each land do you use?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** First off: There's a Pack Wars variant where you look at the booster then add the lands you want. So "as many as I want" is a perfectly reasonable, in-bounds answer. Heretical, but reasonable.

I always used two of each basic land (plus whatever land is in the booster), because that's how I learned. That gives you 11 or 12 lands in a five-color, 25-card deck, and over time I noticed a lot of mana-screw in Pack Wars. It also takes away the dream of ever even casting color-intensive spells like [Roil Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roil+Elemental).

![Shimmering Grotto](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shimmering+Grotto)On the other hand, three of each basic land leaves your deck at more than 50% land, which is a little much. That means that three-of-each-basic Pack Wars games come down to boring topdeck wars just a little too often for my taste.

The compromise my friends and I concocted was to use two of each basic plus two or three [Shimmering Grotto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimmering+Grotto)s, of which we had hundreds. This will fix your ugly five-color mana as well as bringing your total number of lands down to something a little more manageable. You can also customize with nonbasics that are interesting in the particular set you're using. You could put three [Unstable Frontier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable+Frontier)s in a *Conflux* pack, or three [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse)s in a *Zendikar* pack.

That's my personal favorite solution, but once you start requiring a particular nonbasic land, you're taking Pack Wars rapidly away from its roots as a quick and dirty way to play **Magic**. Three of each basic works fine (and it's definitely better than two of each). In a lot of sets, you'll even find there's something for you to do with that extra land—retrace in *Eventide*, Spellshapers in *Time Spiral*, and most recently, landfall in *Zendikar*.
