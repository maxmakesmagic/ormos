Casual Conversations

As should be clear by now, MagicTheGathering.com is very interested in setting up conversations between the site’s writers and its readers. There are two reasons for this.


First, Wizards as a company wants a direct pipeline of talk back and forth with its customers. (I should make clear here that I am not an employee, just a contracted writer… so when I get the occasional email telling me how worrisome *my* online pricing policies are, I chuckle, sympathize, and pass the word on to my editor, who is indeed a paid employee of our favorite fascist collective.) This is just good business sense.



*Speak your mind on the message boards. Yes, we pay attention.*
Second, the Wizards employees and indirect subservients like me who work on this site really do get a thrill from the conversations we have with readers. This is love of writing, and connecting with an audience.


From time to time, I’ll take a moment in Serious Fun to respond to reader feedback. I might pick an email or two, or perhaps a posting I see on the site’s forum message threads. This week, I’ll focus on the message forum for this column.


### HOSE AS MURDER WEAPON?


From “Arpy”:



> 
> Hi Anthony,

> I enjoyed your "Who's to Hose" column but thought it skirted some of the more serious design flaws in **Magic**. The heart of the issue is that **Magic** is designed for dueling and the tournament scene (deck construction limited to cards from recent expansions) and that casual play is often multiplayer with much more relaxed deck construction rules (I would say Type 1 but this isn't really right).
> 
> 
> The color-specific "Hoser" cards and combos you mention are likely too specific to be of use in dueling or are at least balanced. In casual play they can be dominating to the point of ruining the game. Unfortunately this is just one category of "broken" cards for casual play….This problem is more than a small subset of cards and combos but extends to entire deck concepts and strategies.
> 
> 
> What recourse does the group of casual players have? Your article recommends some interesting workarounds but the central problems will remain as long as WotC continues to ignore the casual player. Are card expansions, rules, banned lists, variants and other content that is designed specifically for the casual player (yes even at the exclusion of the tournament player) too much to ask?

(NOTE FROM THE FUTURE - I’m writing this paragraph last, after the rest of the article. Turns out my answer here runs a bit long. But I feel strongly about the subject matter and want readers to know where I stand. Many of you are new to me, and I to you. If you haven’t read much of me off of this site, you should probably get a sense of how I think and feel about this sort of thing. So here goes.)


Arpy raises a central issue that I’m sure this column will touch on more than once. **Magic** is a game that feeds several groups, and one of the most oft-repeated dichotomy (beyond those people that use words like “dichotomy” and those who spare their audience the pain) is between tournament play and casual play.


Arp (Can I call you Arp?… Thanks…), there are some things in your post that I’m right on board with, and other things that I feel you overstate. Let’s start with the common ground.


First, I agree that a color-hosing strategy tends to have a more dramatic impact in a multiplayer game than in many duels. As you probably know, this is because most players don’t show up at a kitchen table with a sideboard for stuff like [Boil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boil) and [Light of Day](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Light+of+Day). I hope that my dim view of color hosing in general came through in that article; I *strongly* prefer the kind of deck that I suggested, which hoses *strategies* that one or more colors may depend on. That usually leads to more interesting and fun games.



*These cards are awful in multiplayer. Awfully effective... and awfully not fun.*
You also notice in your posting that it’s not just color-hosing that can cause frustration in some casual games. Right on. I would point to mana-denial as the number one culprit. [Stasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis), [Winter Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter+Orb), [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon)-based decks, just about anything that shuts down mana are excellent tournament strategy but tend to drive casual players nuts, since mana-denial stops the back and forth of interesting tricks, creature swarms, and card combinations. No one likes coming to a fireworks show only to be drenched by a thunderstorm.


Where I think my view may diverge from yours, though, is in my analysis of what Wizards has done for the past three blocks. *Masques*, *Invasion*, and *Odyssey* block have been three of the most amazing blocks for casual players. On [starcitygames.com](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=www.starcitygames.com), I do a Hall of Fame for multiplayer cards; expansions from all three blocks contribute a large chunk of each color’s Hall.


But while much of the success for us casual players comes in the body of cards like [Radiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiate) or [Spinal Embrace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spinal+Embrace), a good part of it also comes from the “toning down” of the classic, overpowered control cards that plague many tables.


Yes, the toning down of control. People talk about how the sets have slowed down aggressive cards; and that’s partly true; but some of the champion cards of control have also taken a break. Newer players see a game that is more balanced and more accepting of the kind of casual game they probably want to play. Look at the changes seen in those most recent three blocks to mass land-destruction (or mana-lock):


* [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) is now [Epicenter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Epicenter), in the right color but so much harder to make work.
* [Stasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis)’s most recent derivative is [Rising Waters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rising+Waters), still annoying but far less abusable.
* [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance) is now [Balancing Act](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balancing+Act), which gives affected players more choices.
* The ultimate tutor for many combo or control decks, [Demonic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Tutor), is now twice as expensive in [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor).

In addition, *Apocalypse*’s ridiculously good cards were all on the aggressive side -- [Spiritmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger), [Lightning Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel), and so on. Control cards like [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) are excellent, but hardly unfriendly to multiplayer tables. Even the counterspells are creatures or do damage. (The prominent “control” exception in that expansion is [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), which spares lands.)


What’s more exciting to me, speaking of the Deed, is that there are more and more cards that bring together elements of good tournament *and* casual play. The cards I rave most about are those that work in multiple environments. [Misdirection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misdirection) is good anywhere. Ditto [Urza's Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage), [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate), or [Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void). And pros Brian Kibler and Zvi Mowshowitz brought dragons to the Top 8 of a Pro Tour. If you want examples of non-rare cards, green beasts like [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and [Blastoderm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blastoderm), red burn like [Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire) and [Violent Eruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption), black removal from [Massacre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Massacre) to [Faceless Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher)… the list of “good multiplayer” cards that see constructed or limited tournament play is large and growing.


### PARALLEL PLAY


While those cards above merge the two worlds, which is nice to see, Wizards provides plenty of cards that are obviously designed for each. I don’t think we should begrudge the tournament set their [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator)s any more than they should begrudge us our [Radiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiate)s. Both kinds of cards (and other, completely silly, cards like [Atogatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atogatog), which [only dorks talk about](http://archive.wizards.com/sideboard/article.asp?x=sb20010921c).) have gotten plenty of development work, as well as press, from Wizards. So I don’t agree that Wizards ignores the casual player when they builds their sets…not since *Urza’s* block, anyhow.


Arpy, the last question you ask involves rules and bannings and such. Frankly, I don’t see the need for all of this. A group can follow general Type 1 banned and restricted lists (or Type 2, or whatever they want to agree on) and have a rich variety of decks. How on earth would Wizards come up with a banned/restricted list for casual play?


More to the point, why would we want such a thing?


The trappings of tournament play are just that -- trappings. If you want to operate in a controlled environment where everyone follows the same rules and we all keep track of wins and points, there’s tournament **Magic**. If you want to let loose and play casually with friends, then I think you already have what you want. What exactly can Wizards give us that we don’t already have?



*Anthony cites cards like these as indication that casual and multiplayer play are being catered to.*
Perhaps an occasional resource to give you ideas is what you mean, Arpy. If that’s the case, then that’s why Wizards asked me to be here. (They also, to their credit, put out a boxed set a couple of years ago [geared toward multiplayer](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/expert/battle_royale/welcome.asp). If folks found that sort of thing useful and fun, do speak up and ask for another one.) I’m serving here much the same way an ombudsman works at a newspaper, as an independent point of contact and resource for customers who want the corporation to hear and answer them.


Arpy, I hope that really long answer gives us the start of a conversation. Feel free to write back, via email or the message board, to counter anything I said, clarify anything you said, or whatever. I’ll keep scanning the message boards for this issue, and others. (I won’t post on there for now, simply because I don’t feel it’s appropriate for me to barge in on a discussion that is primarily for readers. My role there will be listening, not talking.)


### OTHER CONVERSATION PIECES


I’d like to encourage readers, when they email me or post to the message board, to consider two other discussion topics.


**TOPIC ONE.** I plan on doing a column on the best expansion for multiplayer formats. I’d love to hear from folks what they think. Was it *Invasion*, with its dragon legends and color-mixing? Was it an old-school expansion like *Legends*, or *Ice Age*, with their meaty, ground-breaking cards? Or is it a “sleeper” like *Stronghold*, with the amazing [Sliver Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen) and artifacts like [Portcullis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Portcullis)?


When you tell me what you think, please include clear reasons why you feel the way you do. What about the set really pushed the game for group players? What made it “fun?” What are your memories of opening it for the first time? Go ahead and babble a bit; I sure do.


If folks want to cast the conversation as the “best block,” in addition to the best expansion, that’s okay, too; I’ll do up a bit on that as well.


**TOPIC TWO.** By reader request, I’m thinking of spending a week on “solitaire” formats of **Magic**. I honestly don’t play much of that type myself, but I certainly am aware of such variants. I’d be interested to hear from those who indulge more often what nifty ideas they have.
