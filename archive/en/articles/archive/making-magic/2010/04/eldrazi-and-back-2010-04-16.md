 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 





Today I'm going to walk through some *Rise of Eldrazi* cards and share design and development stories with you. Development? Isn't this the design column? It is but I have to let you in on a little secret (okay, not exactly a secret since I [told you last week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/86)): I wasn't on the *Rise of Eldrazi* design team, I was on the *Rise of Eldrazi* development team.

How did that happen? Well, I wasn't on the *Rise* design team because I was a little swamped with other design teams. For starters, I was designing back-to-back large fall sets (for the trivia buffs out there, I was the second person to do such; Mike Elliott did so with *Urza's Saga* and *Mercadian Masques*) as well as being on the *Worldwake* design team (it was Ken Nagle's first time as a lead, and I'm also on all sets of a designer's first lead, kind of like how your first parachute jump is normally a tandem jump). 

While I mostly work on design teams, I got my start on development teams (for my first four or so years I was on every **Magic** development teamâ€”all of **Magic** Ramp;D, was as there were so few of us). The developers like having a designer on the teams as we're good for fixing cards on the spot in ways other than just tweaking numbers. Since I wasn't involved of the design of *Rise* it seemed like a good time to be on a development team. This would guarantee that I had plenty of opportunity to get to know the set.

With the exposition out of the way, let's get to the stories:
