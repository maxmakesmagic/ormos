El Goleador del Torneo. 


The King of the Hill. 


The top name on the standings sheet. It's the most coveted position on the first day of the tournament, as it gives players the best chance of making it through to the Top 8. Over the course of the day, we only had two players earn the title of Goleador. The first took the role at the beginning of Round 4: Fernando Calvo. Calvo's Boros Aggro deck made mincemeat of opponents all day long. It was an unexpected deck archetype to occupy the top spot, but it didn't appear to have many weaknesses. First, Calvo defeated Ezequiel Antal's Monoblack Devotion deck. Then, he made short work of an incredibly cool Naya Control deck piloted by German Vendler. Finally, he came up against Emiliano Esperidioni and his Monoblack Devotion deck. This time, fate was not on Calvo's side, as he fell from his perch atop the standings.

 Yet things would stay close to home, literally, as the newest Goleador turned out to be Axel Rodriguez, a friend of Calvo's that hailed from the same town about 400 meters from Buenos Aires. Small world! Taking the mantle from his friend, Rodriguez proceeded to defend his position from opponents until the closing bell. First, he took revenge on the Monoblack Devotion menace, dispatching Pedro Laplaza in Round 7. Rodriguez was running another unorthodox choice for the field, opting for an aggressive Esper deck featuring [Lyev Skyknight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lyev+Skyknight), [Precinct Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precinct+Captain), and [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos). The aggressive build trumped the Esper Control build in the next round, as Rodriguez was able to defeat Cristian Segula to move within one match of ending the first day of play undefeated.

 The last round was a tense affair. Only five players managed to escape to the final round of play without a scratch, and Rodriguez was one of them. He found himself the lone undefeated player paired down in the final round, facing off against Christian Alicio and his Esper Control deck. It took a full three games, but Rodriguez's Brimaz and [Precinct Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precinct+Captain) proved too aggressive and too powerful for Alicio, knocking him to 7-2, yet still into Day 2. That made Axel Rodriguez one of the three undefeated players at the end of the day, joining Sergio Ramadan and Mateus Dos Anjos at a perfect 9-0. Even better, despite getting paired down in the final round, Rodriguez's path to the top was difficult enough to keep him at the top of the standings, ensuring that he will remain El Goleador del Torneo to begin the day tomorrow, where he will have to defend his title six more times on the way to the Top 8 cutoff!
