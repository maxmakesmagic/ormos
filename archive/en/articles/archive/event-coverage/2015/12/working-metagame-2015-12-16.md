In spite of the fact that the Extended qualifier season has just started, a few deck archetypes have emerged as clear favourites. At the end of the last Extended season, NecroDonate, also called Trix, sailed up as the major decktype. With the banning of Dark Ritual and Mana Vault, a lot of people thought NecroDonate was dead, but the deck has proved its value also without those mana accelerators.

| The new NecroDonate uses Mox Diamonds and most often Peat Bogs or City of Traitors for mana acceleration. It can easily bust out a turn three Necropotence, and with Duresses it can get rid of most of the important threats by stripping them from an opponent's hand. Firestorm takes care of the annoying Lyrists, and altogether, Trix doesn't have any really bad match-ups.

### THE BEST DECK




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | "Trix is the best deck of the format, and I always play the best deck," Benedikt Klauser says. The Austrian top 8 finisher from 2000 Worlds chose to play with Illusions and Donates just like a lot of other players. He chose to play two Pyroblast main deck because he feels that about eight out of ten decks will be playing Counterspells and Force of Wills. Main deck Pyros seem to be the 'new tech' of the NecroDonate decks. Benedikt is fairly confident in making day two, and his goal is top 16. "Two Pro Tour points will put me closer to the Tokyo masters," he reveals.

| Lauren Passmore also chose to play Trix. "I didn't want to play it, but I've been doing a lot of playtesting and I still think it's the most consistent deck," she says. She chose to spend her Thanksgiving holiday in Florence playing Magic, and with only one bye, she doesn't really have any other goals than first and foremost reaching day two. "And even if I scrub out, I have a nice place to sightsee," she smiles.

|  | Swedish Mattias Jorstedt and German Dominik Hothow like Trix as well. "I play Trix because it's the best deck," Mattias says, echoing the opinions of Benedikt Klauser. Dominik agrees, and he also likes playing combo decks. Still, PandeBurst was never an option. "PandeBurst is inferior. It has no Necro," Dominik says. In spite of him playing the best deck though, Dominik only expects to make top 32: "Sometimes you can't help losing the mirror match-up, but I mostly beat everything else." Mattias doesn't think NecroDonate will last long though when Planeshift is released. "This is the last chance to play it because of Meddling Mage," he believes.

### DAN-DAN?




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Other combo-decks have also emerged, and PandeBurst has done well in a couple of other Grand Prix events. "Trix is by far the best deck, but I don't like it," Antoine Ruel says. He tested Slivers but found them too weak, so he asked one of his friends for a deck and was given a PandeBurst deck. "I think I've got a 50-50 chance of beating Trix. I've got four Dan-Dans in the sideboard, that's my tech. They are big and cheap," he smiles. Antoine hasn't done any testing though, so he'll be happy to make top 16 with the deck.

| --- | --- |
|  | Stasis is an old deck archetype, and Olle RÃ¥de brought a Stasis deck to Florence. "There are no good beat down decks, and I didn't have enough cards to play Trix. I just borrowed the deck from Mattias Kettil," he says. Olle had only one bye, but hoped that his Stasis deck would win against random decks he could encounter during the first rounds. But he didn't really seem to care that much about results. "It's cool to go to Florence, and I went here to keep Mattias company," he smiles.

| --- | --- |
| "I wanted to play a deck with all the best cards in Extended, being Force of Will, Duress, Swords to Plowshares, Seal of Cleansing and Wasteland. This deck just wrecks people," Justin Gary says. When asked about his expectations for the event, he replies with a grin: "Anything less than winning is disgraceful!" Justin's tech was four Duress main deck as they are good regardless of the match-up, but especially against Trix.

| Ryan Fuller chose to play Tradewind-Survival. "It doesn't matter what I play," he grins, very confident in his own abilities. "I could win this tournament with my type 2 deck, but I decided to save it for Chicago," he adds. His best match-ups are supposedly Europeans, but he fears Justin Gary. But with main deck Mother of Runes, he can protect two creatures a turn with the Mother and the Quirion Rangers. Perhaps that will be enough even to beat Gary.

### AGGRESSIVE ANSWERS




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| There aren't many beatdown decks that are considered viable in the environment, but CounterSliver is one of the exceptions. Using a multitude of Slivers for beat down along with Counterspells and enchantment hate, the deck has a chance against the combo decks. "It's aggressive with answers," Trey van Cleave says. The Denmark based American chose to play the deck because he feels that it beats decks based around blue cards and enchantments. While the deck can run into trouble against other beat down decks, Trey reckons that they will beat each other out during the first three rounds. "I wouldn't play this if I didn't have three byes," he admits.

|  | Nicolai Herzog is known for playing Stompy, but the green beat down was left back in Oslo in favour of the Slivers. The Norwegian expected a lot of control and combo, like Oath, Survival and Trix. "CounterSliver is good against Survival, it's one of the better choices against Trix and it's reasonable against Oath. It's a metagame call that I think is pretty good," Nicolai says. He admits that he doesn't play a lot of Extended, Pro Tour Chicago is more important to him at the moment. "I'm not a very skilled CounterSliver player, but I have played it before, and I'm making top 16," he thinks. "I need some expectations, or else I wouldn't be here." It goes with the story though that Nicolai wouldn't be in Florence if he had known that there won't be a Masters event in 2001 Pro Tour LA. "I've been trying to collect Pro Tour points for that event, and now I found out that there are no Masters in LA. It's not a total waste though, but I'm slightly dissatisfied," he reveals.

### BEATDOWN!




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Edward Fear went one step further in the beat down strategy. "I'm playing Hatred. I think Trix is the better deck, I know how to play Hatred as I qualified for three Pro Tours with it. You consistently get a turn three Hatred with Unmask backup, and that's fast enough to deal with Tradewind Survival and Slivers," he says. "I have a bit of trouble with Trix, but I just have to play handkill and prevent them from casting Necro. And I have three Winter Orbs and three Forsaken Wastes in the sideboard," he reveals. Ed feels that the metagame is fairly open though, and not at all like when Trix had Dark Rituals and Mana Vaults. "But you need something to beat Trix. I think Trix will consistently finish up high. It doesn't have any bad match-ups."

| One of the 'worst' match-ups for NecroDonate is Brian Kowal's Ace Deuce deck. With a 50 percent win rate against Trix before sideboarding, it's not a bad choice for those who want to play beat down. The deck is basically a version of Three Deuce, and it sports a lot of small, but efficient creatures along with plenty of enchantment hate. "It's quite good against Trix and very good against decks with enchantments. I think it's a solid deck," Scott Wills says. He chose to play Ace Deuce in Florence and he would be happy to make day two. "I only have one bye due to a ranking mix-up, and I have to go 5-1 to make day two," he says. It may happen though if he doesn't run into a lot of other beat down decks. "The worst match-ups are Stompy and Sligh, but I don't expect a lot of it," he admits.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| David Price is the king of beat down, and while few other pros would choose Sligh, he went for the Mountain, Jackal Pup strategy. "Desperation," he smiles. "I didn't like any decks that are good in the metagame, and I hope everybody took out their anti-red cards and that Sligh is better than it appears to be." David chose a rather unusual approach to red though. He added four Badlands and Agents of Stromgald to his deck to support Demonic Consultations. "I just like Consults. It's broken. Every deck can put Consults in it, and I don't see why red shouldn't have it," he says. Finally, David admits that he wouldn't play Sligh without three byes - and that he doesn't really know the metagame that much. "I've only tested one night, but I hope to play against CounterSliver. I have four Price of Progresses, and I think I will crush it. Other than that, I have no idea."
