Live Coverage of 2003 Pro Tour New Orleans
==========================================












Welcome To New Orleans
----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/ptno03_main.jpg)Rickard Österberg is the **Pro Tour - New Orleans** Champion! Armed with the mighty Punisher concoction "George W. Bosh", a Tinker deck that exploits the power of [Goblin Welder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder), he sailed over a sea of mono-blue Tinker decks, Gob-Vantage, and Severance/Charbelcher.


In the quarters he faced Eugene Harvey, piloting the CMU-TOGIT "So Big Tinks". [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) had been hosing people all weekend, and it continued to work its magic against Österberg. They went the full five games, with Österberg killing Harvey with a hasted Platinum Angel. Harvey's Upheaval was useless. In the semis, he showed his deck's power against Yann Hamon and the french Severance/Charbelcher deck "The Clock". It was a slaughter in three games.


On the other side of the bracket, Tomohiro Yokosuka's [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) deck couldn't handle Nassif's Clock, and Nassif swept. Masashi Oiso kept hope alive for Japan, defeating Hans Joachim Höh in four. He then took on Nassif, and it all came down to one [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). Nassif's deck served up [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) he needed, and advanced to the finals.


The finals were another tight contest, but the star of the weekend, [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), was not to be denied. Nassif conceded before Österberg could steal his third consecutive turn. Congratulations to Rickard Österberg, **Pro Tour - New Orleans** Champion!
