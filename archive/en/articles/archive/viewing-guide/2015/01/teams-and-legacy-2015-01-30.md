[Grand Prix San Jose](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-san-jose-2015) will play host to some terrific three-player teams as they tackle the new Team Limited formats with *Fate Reforged* and *Khans of Tarkir*.



With six packs of *Fate Reforged* and six packs of *Khans of Tarkir* at each team's disposal, the decks that the players assemble can be brutal and efficient. It's also the chance to see powerhouse teams such as Eric Froehlich, Luis-Scott Vargas, and Paul Cheon paired together, working toward one trophy. Speaking of which, those three will be in San Jose, and they aren't the only sweet team you can expect to see!



Join Marshall Sutcliffe, Brian David-Marshall, and Hall of Famer Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa as they bring you live coverage of GP San Jose on the [ChannelFireball Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/channelfireball) starting Saturday and Sunday at 10:15 a.m. PT/1:15 p.m. ET/7:15 p.m. GMT.

With [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) now gone from the format, which Eternal decks will emerge as the top dogs when players are able to use some of the best cards available to them from *Magic*'s history?
