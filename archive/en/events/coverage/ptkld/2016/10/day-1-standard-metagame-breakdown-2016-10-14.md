 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






Pro Tour *Kaladesh* is big, and we're not just talking about the player count. With only a few days of *Kaladesh* availability on *Magic Online*, and just one major weekend tournament way back during release weekend, understanding the metagame of Standard was a daunting challenge for players. Vehicles and aggro in general looked good, but powerful combinations of cards lurked just outside the flashy tournament victories, and finding the answers to everything would give you the presumed control deck nobody believed could exist.


Here's where the 466-strong player field ended up:




| Archetype | Count | % Field |
| Temur Aetherworks | 82 | 17.60% |
| Black-Green Delirium | 55 | 11.80% |

| Temur Eldrazi Ramp | 1 | 0.20% |
| Temur Ramp | 1 | 0.20% |
| Total | 466 | 100.00% |

That's quite an unwieldy list. Let's roll things up a step further.




| Archetype | Total | % Field |
| Aetherworks | 100 | 21.50% |
| Delirium | 64 | 13.70% |
| Midrange | 46 | 9.90% |

| Ramp | 2 | 0.40% |
| Devoid | 1 | 0.20% |
| Total | 466 | 100.00% |

That'sâ€¦still pretty wild. Here's what's going on.


Aetherworks Marvel
==================


How does a turn four [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End) or [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) sound? If it's you that's casting it, then you're probably on board, and that's exactly what happened here. Multiple testing groups and pros settled on the powerful [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) card as the way forward in Standard.




| Aetherworks |  |
| Bant Aetherworks | 6 |
| Four-Color Aetherworks | 2 |
| Green-Blue Aetherworks | 7 |
| Red-Green Aetherworks | 3 |
| Temur Aetherworks | 82 |

While the Temur build was far and away the most popular deck choice, all the [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) decks rely on early sources of energy, such as [Attune with Aether](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attune+with+Aether), that ensure Aetherworks will hit the battlefield firing. If there isn't a monstrosity in waiting near the top of the library, finding a way to generate enough energy to fire again would be, ensuring that as long as [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) is sitting on the battlefield, you can count on it giving you something.


The balance of the deck helps fend off everything else and gives time to set up the engine, with favorite [Kozilek's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return) serving both as early- and late-game battlefield wipes.


Delirium
========




| Delirium |  |
| Black-Green Delirium | 55 |
| Jund Delirium | 8 |
| Red-Green Delirium | 1 |

Delirium decks make the return from the previous Standard format, and they too were a popular choice among players that tested together. Delirum is a creature-heavy deck that's somewhat aggressive, but brings with it the best midrange options. Creatures like Ishkana, Grafwidow can take over a game, stymieing other aggressive strategies, and with things like [Pick the Brain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pick+the+Brain) and [Transgress the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind) available to hit opponents' hands, it can fight combo decks like [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) too.


Aggressive Decks
================




| Aggro |  |
| Black-Red Aggro | 38 |
| Mono-White Aggro | 1 |
| Red-White Equipment | 1 |
| Red-White Tokens | 1 |
| White-Black Aggro | 3 |



| Devoid |  |
| Grixis Devoid | 1 |



| Energy |  |
| Red-Green Energy | 31 |
| Temur Energy | 4 |



| Humans |  |
| Green-White Humans | 3 |
| Mono-White Humans | 1 |
| Naya Humans | 1 |
| Red-White Humans | 7 |



| Madness |  |
| Black-Red Madness | 21 |
| Blue-Black Madness | 1 |
| Grixis Madness | 1 |



| Vehicles |  |
| Four-Color Vehicles | 1 |
| Mardu Vehicles | 13 |
| Red-White Vehicles | 29 |

Aggressive decks, in a general sense, were the largest overall group of decks, and came in the widest set of options. Vehicle decks, like Red-White and Mardu, planned to overpower opponents with an aggressive curve topped out by [Fleetwheel Cruiser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleetwheel+Cruiser) or [Skysovereign, Consul Flagship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skysovereign%2C+Consul+Flagship). [Veteran Motorist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Motorist) and [Depala, Pilot Exemplar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Depala%2C+Pilot+Exemplar) put a fast clock on opponents without a way to answer them. Being the winning deck for the biggest Standard tournament before the Pro Tour put it on the map as step one in aggressive choices.


Black-Red Aggro was another popular option, with [Unlicensed Disintegration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration) packed in as an absolute answer to opponents' creatures. Here, [Bomat Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bomat+Courier) and [Pia Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pia+Nalaar) provided range and speed, though vehicles like [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter) and [Fleetwheel Cruiser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleetwheel+Cruiser) rounded out its ways to apply pressure. Unlike vehicles decks, there wasn't particular synergy with them in Black-Red Aggro. They were just great vehicles that hit hard too.


Black-Red Madness repeated from the previous Standard format, though now it was one of the stronger decks to consider. It took powerful removal like [Unlicensed Disintegration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration), but instead focused on making use of madness and the graveyard to get ahead. [Cryptbreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptbreaker) draws cards as [Haunted Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Dead) and [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam) fill up the graveyard alongside [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper), ideally fired by discarding it to [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter) or [Cathartic Reunion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathartic+Reunion). [Scrapheap Scrounger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapheap+Scrounger) rounded things out in this and other decks ready to get a creature back from the graveyard.


Finally, Red-Green Energy rounded out the biggest hits from aggressive decks. Like [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) decks, early sources of energy power the deck. Unlike the combo-in-a-card artifact, Red-Green Energy was all about [Longtusk Cub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longtusk+Cub), [Voltaic Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Brawler), and other creatures that care about energy. [Electrostatic Pummeler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Pummeler) provided combo potential thanks to [Blossoming Defense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blossoming+Defense) and Larger than Life, but the deck didn't need that combination exclusively. [Longtusk Cub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longtusk+Cub) or [Bristling Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bristling+Hydra) unanswered was enough alone too.


Control and Midrange
====================




| Control |  |
| Blue-Black Control | 2 |
| Blue-Red Control | 6 |
| Grixis Control | 3 |
| Jeskai Control | 18 |
| Mardu Control | 1 |
| Temur Control | 1 |
| White-Black Control | 6 |
| White-Blue Control | 7 |



| Midrange |  |
| Bant Midrange | 13 |
| Black-Red Midrange | 2 |
| Black-White Midrange | 1 |
| Green-White Midrange | 9 |
| Mardu Midrange | 3 |
| Red-Green Midrange | 1 |
| Red-White Angels | 1 |
| Sultai Midrange | 4 |
| White-Blue Flash | 6 |
| White-Blue Midrange | 4 |
| White-Colorless Midrange | 2 |

Contrary to popular belief, control was still around in *Kaladesh* Standard. Jeskai Control was the most popular angle, piling up removal like [Harnessed Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harnessed+Lightning) and [Incendiary Flow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incendiary+Flow) with some number of [Void Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Shatter), [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), or other countermagic to handle bigger things. [Dynavolt Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dynavolt+Tower) was the surprise inclusion here, ensuring that as instants get used to answer threats, extra [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s show up to help out. Unsurprisingly, [Fumigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumigate) was often a one-of or entirely excluded from decklists. Sorcery-speed answers don't work well against the aggressive vehicle decks, which was a must-answer deck for the weekend.


Midrange too had plenty of picks, with Bant and Green-White options leading the way. Almost all of these decks played [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) and [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate). Blue-inclusive versions packing the venerable [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) and [Spell Queller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Queller) from the old [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) decks. Like in the last Standard format, these midrange decks played creatures that hit above their curve, and fight off fast aggressive decks with sheer value. Here, [Verdurous Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdurous+Gearhulk)s appeared *en masse* to ensure oversized threats would dominate late.


Final Choices
=============




| Colossus | 10 |
| Grixis Colossus | 2 |
| Jeskai Colossus | 1 |
| Temur Colossus | 7 |



| Emerge | 31 |
| Blue-Black Emerge | 1 |
| Blue-Red Emerge | 4 |
| Four-Color Emerge | 1 |
| Grixis Emerge | 12 |
| Temur Emerge | 11 |
| White-Blue Emerge | 2 |



| Ramp | 2 |
| Temur Eldrazi Ramp | 1 |
| Temur Ramp | 1 |



| Spells | 11 |
| Blue-Red Spells | 11 |

Emerge decks also returned, largely similar to their previous Standard incarnations. [Elder Deep-Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Deep-Fiend) provides a powerful way to disrupt opponents, and [Filigree Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filigree+Familiar) served as a new body to sacrifice for value entering and leaving the battlefield. Grixis and Temur options varied with their bodies but used [Kozilek's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return) to keep the board clear until Deep-Fiends or bigger things could be found.


Ramp was hardly visible at all in the field, limited to just two players, each adapting from Temur options.


[Metalwork Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalwork+Colossus) was the core of another combo deck. Unlike [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) builds, the acceleration in Colossus decks could power out other threats too, such as [Skysovereign, Consul Flagship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skysovereign%2C+Consul+Flagship). Like in Aetherworks decks, [Glint-Nest Crane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint-Nest+Crane) helped find the necessary pieces, and the story-pivotal [Deadlock Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadlock+Trap) could buy time while making [Metalwork Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalwork+Colossus) come down faster. [Sanctum of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+of+Ugin) made this deck exciting as one Colossus typically led to anotherâ€¦cast for free, of course. Without [Fumigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumigate) hanging around in many decks, answering multiple [Metalwork Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalwork+Colossus) was a tough challenge for opponents.


Blue-Red Spells also made a comeback, though eschewing [Fevered Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fevered+Visions) in most builds to instead use [Dynavolt Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dynavolt+Tower). Like Jeskai Control decks, Spells decks used red removal to stay alive and keep the path clear for a lonely [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk) later on. "Free" [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s are pretty good then they come from card draw and filtering like [Anticipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anticipate), [Take Inventory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Take+Inventory) and [Tormenting Voice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormenting+Voice).
