Known Issues List Updates
=========================


The Known Issues list has been updated with the list of fixes that went out with the March 23 deployment, plus several new known issues. Several of the new known issues will be relevant in full Ravnica Block drafts, so they have been added to that section as well as the full known issues list.


The Known Issues List below has been updated, so refer to that for the most up-to-date statuses on *Magic Online* known issues. If you want to see the history of fixed known issues, refer to the [archive](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-fixed-known-issues-archive).




Ravnica Block Known Issues
--------------------------





The following are a list of bugs relevant to the *Ravnica: City of Guilds* Flashback Draft events. *Ravnica: City of Guilds* will be part of the available Flashback Draft format from March 16 to April 6.




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Status | Description | Format/Category |
| Ongoing | The summoning sickness whirl does not appear on the top token in a stack of summoning-sick creature tokens if one is tapped to help cast a convoke spell. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | The "No Possible Play: Yield All" function, associated with the keyboard shortcut F8 by default, does not work correctly for a player who has a convoke card in their hand. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | [Blood Funnel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Funnel) does not allow its controller to sacrifice a creature during the resolution of its triggered ability. | Flashback Drafts |
| Ongoing | If an Aura becomes attached to a [Bramble Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental) that causes the Elemental to change controllers, the Elemental's triggered ability is incorrectly controlled by the previous controller of [Bramble Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental), not the new controller of [Bramble Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental). Notably for this Limited format, this interaction may occur with [Dream Leash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Leash). | Flashback Drafts |
| Newly Fixed | Cardset | [Gaze of the Gorgon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon) now properly destroys creatures again. | Flashback Drafts |
| Newly Added | [Transguild Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transguild+Courier) lacks a visual indicator displaying that it is all colors. | Flashback Drafts |
| Newly Added | Graft triggers do not display red targeting arrows indicating the creature to receive a +1/+1 counter. Instead, all permanents other than the creature with graft and the creature that triggered graft are dimmed while pointing the cursor at the ability and while the ability is resolving. | Flashback Drafts |
| Newly Added | If a player is instructed to discard more cards than they have in their hand, and one of those cards is a split card, the button to indicate that the player is ready to proceed will be incorrectly labeled "Cancel" instead of "Done". | Flashback Drafts |
| Newly Added | Cardset | In order to use any cards with the Azorius Senate's forecast ability, players must have a stop set during their upkeep. Without a stop set, a player won't be given priority during that phase, and players do not automatically have a stop set for them during their upkeep. Click [here](https://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/34/=3.01) for information on how to set stops. | Flashback Drafts |
| Newly Added | Players assigning combat damage to a series of blocking creatures are unable to change the amount of damage assigned to a creature with a damage prevention shield. | General, Flashback Drafts |
| Newly Added | In certain scenarios, abilities that exchange control of permanents between players fail to function as intended. Notably, this impacts [Spawnbroker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker) and [Vedalken Plotter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Plotter). | Flashback Drafts |

| Status | Description | Format |
| Ongoing | When a player casts [Kozilek, the Great Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+the+Great+Distortion), its triggered ability incorrectly triggers if the casting player has seven or more cards in hand. Upon resolution, the player will not draw cards if he or she already has seven or more cards in hand. | Commander, Legacy, Modern, and Standard |
| Ongoing | If a creature enchanted by [Visions of Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions+of+Brutality) fights another creature (say, due to some [Unnatural Aggression](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unnatural+Aggression)), and is dealt lethal damage this way, the enchanted creature incorrectly does not deal damage to its controller. | Limited |
| Ongoing | In certain circumstances, [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) incorrectly exiles creature tokens created by [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). | Limited and Standard |
| Ongoing | [Crumble to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumble+to+Dust) incorrectly causes the player to search the library of the land's controller, not owner | Modern and Standard |

| Ongoing | [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher)'s triggered ability incorrectly triggers once for each time a spell targets it. For example, if a player's opponent casts [Agony Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), choosing [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher) for both targets, the triggered ability will trigger twice instead of once. | Modern and Standard |
| Ongoing | Several prompt boxes are incorrect or uninformative. Affected cards include [Harvester Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harvester+Troll) and [Devour in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Flames). | Standard, Limited |
| Ongoing | The mana abilities of [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) and [Kozilek's Translator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Translator) cannot be activated while paying the mana cost of a spell or ability. Players can still activate these abilities at any time that player has priority. | Modern and Standard |

Fixes Deployed March 23
=======================


**Cardset**


* Cardset | Cards that require a player to remove any number of +1/+1 counters (such as [Retribution of the Ancients](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retribution+of+the+Ancients) or [Ooze Flux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ooze+Flux)) incorrectly do not allow a player to remove any counters.

| Ongoing | [Eldrazi Spawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Spawn) and Scions created by cards from the *Battle for Zendikar* and *Rise of the Eldrazi* sets display "Add {1} to your mana pool" instead of "Add {C} to your mana pool" upon zoom. As this change in template was not a functional change, these tokens continue to function correctly. | Standard, Limited, Modern |
| Ongoing | [Soulflayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulflayer) fails to gain abilities from creature cards exiled to pay its mana cost with the delve ability. | Standard |

| Ongoing | Using the first activated ability of [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) while an opponent has only one card in hand causes the game to lock until the player who controls [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) passes priority. | Modern, Legacy |

| Ongoing | [Harbinger of the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbinger+of+the+Tides)'s casting options are displayed incorrectly.

| Ongoing | [Mass Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Polymorph) incorrectly does not count exiled creature tokens when determining how many creature cards to put onto the battlefield. | Commander |

Upon resolution, the player will not draw cards if he or she already has seven or more cards in hand. | Commander, Legacy, Modern, and Standard |
| Ongoing | [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth)'s prompt box text incorrectly suggests that the caster must cast all appropriate exiled spells. This is a display issue only. The cancel button allows the player to continue without casting remaining spells. | Commander and Standard |

| Ongoing | [Void Winnower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) incorrectly prohibits players from casting spells that have both an even converted mana cost and a variable in the mana cost. For example, a player whose opponent controls a [Void Winnower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) is incorrectly prohibited from casting [Rolling Thunder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Thunder) or [Nourishing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nourishing+Shoal), even if the value chosen for X would result in a spell with an odd converted mana cost. Even if a player cannot even, they should be able to odd. | Standard |
| Ongoing | [Hunting Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Wilds), when kicked, incorrectly does not untap the Forest cards put onto the battlefield during its resolution. This only affects Forest cards that enter the battlefield tapped, such as [Temple Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Garden) or [Sapseep Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapseep+Forest). | Modern |
| Ongoing | Cards that are exiled by [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) incorrectly show association arrows while in the Exiled Zone. | Commander, Legacy, Modern, and Standard |
| Ongoing | [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls)'s second ability can incorrectly be used to cast face-down creatures of the chosen creature type.  | Legacy and Modern |
| Ongoing | [Myriad Landscape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myriad+Landscape)'s activated ability incorrectly allows a player to put two basic lands that do not share a land type onto the battlefield. | Commander |
| Ongoing | Zooming in on a card exiled by [a land with Hideaway](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5bhideaway%5d) shows an additional basic swamp. This is a visual-only bug, players cannot play the swamp using Hideaway. WORKAROUND: Right clicking on the exiled show will display it properly.  | Legacy |
| Ongoing | Under rare circumstances, a player who controls two creatures that can't attack alone (such as [Bonded Construct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Construct)) but must attack with one of them will be able to attack with only that creature rather than being required to attack with both. | General |
| Ongoing | When [Entreat the Angels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) is on the stack with 0 chosen for X, the blue text that typically indicates the value of X does not appear. | Legacy |
| Ongoing | [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) incorrectly allows a player to redirect spells or abilities to the [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), even if it's no longer on the battlefield. | Modern |
| Ongoing | *Magic Origins* Planeswalkers used as Commanders will not return to the battlefield after exiling themselves. | Commander |
| Ongoing | Copying [All Suns' Dawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Suns%27+Dawn) sometimes causes a crash. | Commander |
| Ongoing | Spells that target [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) more than once incorrectly trigger [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent)'s ability twice. | Standard |
| Ongoing | Spells with multiple targets (such as [Silumgar's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Command), [Agony Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), etc.) sometimes lack visual indicators to show what is happening to each target. | General |
| Ongoing | [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command)'s first activated ability doesn't appear in the Effect zone after it resolves. | Modern and Standard |
| Ongoing | Conceding while looking at cards with [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) reveals cards to opponent. | Legacy and Vintage |
| Ongoing | [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) lacks visual indicators during targeting to show whether or not it is targeting a player. | Limited |
| Ongoing | [Oracle of Mul Daya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) reveals one too many cards from the top of the library after casting [Genesis Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Wave) or similar spells. | Modern |
| Ongoing | Cards cast with conspire that require a player to sacrifice a creature as an additional cost to cast, such as [Life's Legacy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life%27s+Legacy) and [Momentous Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentous+Fall), incorrectly look at the power and toughness of the last creature clicked for conspire. | Commander |
| Ongoing | [The Chain Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) does not allow planeswalkers that enter the battlefield after activating [The Chain Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) to use their abilities twice.  | Commander |
| Newly Fixed | Lightning Storm’s activated ability once again works as expected. | Modern and Legacy |
| Ongoing | When you play a Ravnica shock land (such as [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain)) off the top of the library with [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), the new top card of the library is incorrectly revealed before you decide whether to pay 2 life.  | Modern |
| Ongoing | Casting [Sylvan Primordial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordial) causes the game to be locked in a multiplayer game if there are no legal targets for one player. | Commander |
| Ongoing | Abilities that generate replacement effects preventing specific cards from being put into graveyards (such as those found on [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) or [Blightsteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus)) do not function properly while resolving [Grenzo, Dungeon Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grenzo%2C+Dungeon+Warden)'s activated ability. | Commander |
| Ongoing | If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that had a choice made as it entered (such as [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) or [Painter's Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant)), the copy correctly allows the controller to make a new choice, but the abilities of the copy that refer to that choice do not function correctly. | Commander |
| Ongoing | Many players report that they are unable to properly split cards into piles when prompted to do so by a card like [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). Cards can no longer be dragged from one pile to another in these scenarios, but players can move cards to another pile by single clicking on the card. | General |
| Ongoing | In certain circumstances, [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) incorrectly exiles creature tokens created by [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). | Limited and Standard |
| Ongoing | If [Deceiver of Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+of+Form)'s triggered ability turns creatures into copies of a Legendary creature, the legend rule fails to apply to the copies. | Commander, Limited, and Standard |
| Newly Fixed | [Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest) now works as expected. Notably, it will no longer exile itself if it enters the battlefield without being cast, nor will it exile a double-faced *Magic Origins* creature/planeswalker attempting to return to the battlefield as a planeswalker. | Standard |
| Ongoing | The mana abilities of [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) and [Kozilek's Translator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Translator) cannot be activated while paying the mana cost of a spell or ability. Players can still activate these abilities at any time that player has priority. | Modern and Standard |
| Ongoing | [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher)'s triggered ability incorrectly triggers once for each time a spell targets it. For example, if a player's opponent casts [Agony Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), choosing [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher) for both targets, the triggered ability will trigger twice instead of once. | Modern and Standard |
| Ongoing | If a creature enchanted by [Visions of Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions+of+Brutality) fights another creature (say, due to some [Unnatural Aggression](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unnatural+Aggression)), and is dealt lethal damage this way, the enchanted creature incorrectly does not deal damage to its controller. | Limited |
| Ongoing | [Goldmeadow Harrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow+Harrier) incorrectly prevents players from submitting or playing with a Pauper deck.  | Pauper |
| Ongoing | [Phyrexian Devourer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Devourer) doesn't actually gain +1/+1 counters from its activated ability, no matter how many cards it devours. | Legacy |
| Ongoing | If a player attempts to sacrifice a pile of Eldrazi babies (Scions or Spawn) at once, only one of those tokens will be sacrificed. | Limited, Modern, and Standard |
| Ongoing | If a player casts [Predict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predict) or [Foreshadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foreshadow), accurately naming one name of a split card (such as [Fire & Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+%2F%2F+Ice)) put into the graveyard by the spell, the player will only draw one card instead of two. | Commander |
| Newly Fixed | Players whose opening hand contains [Gemstone Caverns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Caverns) and who are not playing first can once again choose to have [Gemstone Caverns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Caverns) start the game on the battlefield with a luck counter. | Legacy |
| Ongoing | [Hallowed Moonlight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Moonlight) incorrectly fails to prevent [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet) from creating [Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie) tokens. | Standard |
| Ongoing | [Blood Funnel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Funnel) does not allow its controller to sacrifice a creature during the resolution of its triggered ability. | Flashback Drafts |
| Ongoing | If an Aura becomes attached to a [Bramble Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental) that causes the Elemental to change controllers, the Elemental's triggered ability is incorrectly controlled by the previous controller of [Bramble Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental), not the new controller of [Bramble Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental). Notably for this Limited format, this interaction may occur with [Dream Leash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Leash). | Flashback Drafts |
| Newly Fixed | Cardset | [Gaze of the Gorgon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon) now properly destroys creatures again. | Flashback Drafts |
| Ongoing | Cardset | If [Vesuva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva) copies a land with a static ability and then is later turned into a basic land (perhaps by a [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) or [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas)), that static ability will not be removed. Triggered and activated abilities are correctly removed. | Modern |

Client and Gameplay Known Issues
================================


Client and Gameplay known issues are based around the client and broad mechanical interactions. Each known issue is also sorted by where you're likely to encounter it within the client—those categories are listed below. You can search the below table by keyword, or click each header to sort alphabetically.


**Categories:** Collection, Deckbuilding, Duel Scene, General, Play Lobby, and Trade.




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Status | Description | Category |
| Newly Fixed | Several bugs not listed elsewhere that caused crashes have been resolved, including a bug involving a player conceding while another player is making a mulligan decision. | Duel Scene |
| Newly Fixed | When paying a cost that involves the snow mana symbol, mana from snow permanents is no longer removed from the player's mana pool without being applied to pay the cost. | Duel Scene |
| Newly Fixed | Spells cast for a bestow cost are no longer incorrectly affected by spells or abilities that reduce the cost of creature spells. | Duel Scene |
| Newly Fixed | Activated abilities that require players to discard cards at random, such as those found on [Ogre Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Shaman) and [Barbarian Bully](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Bully), now actually require players to discard cards at random. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Emblems display with an extra border. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Clicking the Play button in an event lobby does not take the player to the next available tournament. | Play Lobby |
| Ongoing | Clicking on the empty space in the Will Receive area does not deselect cards in that area.  | Trade |
| Ongoing | Challenging a player directly does not allow the player to set Wins Per Match or Match Clock options. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | The Search Tool is not present in the Other Products tab of a trade | Trade |
| Ongoing | Dropping out of a game does not concede the game if the player is not the first one to drop out | Duel Scene (Commander) |
| Ongoing | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out. WORKAROUND: If a player suspects this is happening, logging out and back in may resolve the problem. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | While building a Limited deck, if a player sorts the deck under construction by converted mana cost, clicking the "Add Lands" button will return each card to the appropriate pile even if the player individually moved them to another pile. | Deckbuilding (Limited: Draft and Sealed) |
| Ongoing | After clicking the Submit button in a trade, if a player adds or removes cards from the trade, the trade is still incorrectly submitted from his or her trade partner's side. Toast messaging does display in this scenario warning players that the trade proposal has changed, and each player will have an opportunity to confirm the trade before it is performed. | Trade |
| Ongoing | When objects are added to a player's collection, the window displaying these objects incorrectly defaults to sorting them alphabetically and not by type of object. This keeps booster packs earned as prizes from being immediately seen. | Collection |
| Ongoing | Under rare circumstances, the Game Details window will display buttons to replay matches instead of a round timer or standings. As a temporary workaround, logging out and back in resolves the issue. | Play Lobby |
| Ongoing | Extra cards are sometimes added to a player's deck in addition to their choices when sideboarding. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | In certain rare circumstances, the window that displays at the end of an event does not display all prizes that the player has earned. This is a display issue only. All prizes are correctly added to players' collections in these situations.  | Collection |
| Ongoing | Land cards that use the multicolor land frame but do not have mana symbols in their rules text do not appear when filtering to display colorless cards. These lands do appear when filtering for land cards, however. | Collection  |
| Ongoing | Deckbuilding | While creating a deck during a Limited event, if a player has sorted a deck and then moved individual cards (for example, moving a [Clutch of Currents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+Currents) to the 5 CMC column), using the Add Lands button incorrectly re-sorts the deck automatically. | Deckbuilding (Limited: Draft and Sealed) |
| Ongoing | Windows 10 may display an error message that *Magic Online* is an unrecognized application while downloading the client. In order to successfully download the client, click the "More Info" link, then "Run Anyway." | General |
| Ongoing | If a player logs back in after being disconnected during a draft, the timer will incorrectly display as 00:00 for the next pick, regardless of how much time that player actually has to make a selection.  | Limited: Draft |
| Ongoing | If a player's spell or ability causes his or her own cards to be revealed, those cards are incorrectly not added to the player's own Revealed Cards area. The player's opponent should still see the revealed cards correctly. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Creatures that enter the battlefield with counters based on the number of creatures in the graveyard (for example, [Undergrowth Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undergrowth+Scavenger)) do not count themselves if they are put onto the battlefield directly from the graveyard. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | It is visually difficult to tell which set of blockers an attacking player is ordering when ordering multiple sets of multiple blocking creatures. WORKAROUND: You must start by ordering blockers for the left most attacking creature, then hit OK to move on to the next attacking creature to the right. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | When face down cards are given an activated ability, the art displays incorrectly on the stack when that ability is activated. | Duel Scene |
| Newly Fixed | Creatures tapped to help cast a spell with convoke no longer retain a green highlight after the spell is cast. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Duel Scene | Under certain rare scenarios, attacking creatures will display on the opponent's side of the battlefield. Resizing the Magic Online game window resolves this display issue. | General  |
| Ongoing | When casting a spell, if there is any mana already in the player's pool, the most recently produced colored mana is automatically applied to the spell first. For example, if a player taps a [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) (naming [Human](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Human)), then an Island, then casts [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), the blue mana applied to the Delver's mana cost will be that from the Island. If the player tapped the Island, then the Cavern, the Cavern's mana would be applied to the spell, and it would be appropriately uncounterable. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Abilities that reduce mana costs are not correctly being applied to additional costs (such as buyback or multikicker). | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | While paying the mana cost for a card with delve, players cannot remove cards from the delve selection without canceling the casting process and starting over. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Cards that ask a player to choose X targets, such as [Glimpse the Sun God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Sun+God), briefly indicate incorrectly that X is equal to zero when the last potential target is chosen before moving on to the cost payment step. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Cards that search for multiple cards at once don't show the cards properly in the Revealed Cards area. WORKAROUND: The cards are properly identified in the game log. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing/font> | Unusual mana in a player's pool, such as mana from a snow permanent or mana with a rider attached (as that produced by [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls)) cannot be applied to a cost by clicking it. As a temporary workaround, players should produce this mana during the cost payment step in which they want to spend that mana. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | If a player makes a selection, then reverses that selection with the "undo" keyboard shortcut (default: CTRL+Z), the game log will sometimes incorrectly show both cards the player selected. Notably, this includes [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) and similar effects that ask a player to put one of a small number of cards into their hand. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | In certain rare scenarios, a bug may cause a game to restart. If this occurs, errors in the restarted game may cause cards to appear with incorrect watermarks, lands not appearing on the battlefield, or other visual issues. If you experience this issue, please contact Game Support.  | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | The summoning sickness whirl does not appear on the top token in a stack of summoning-sick creature tokens if one is tapped to help cast a Convoke spell. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | The "No Possible Play: Yield All" function, associated with the keyboard shortcut F8 by default, does not work correctly for a player who has a Convoke card in their hand. | Duel Scene |
