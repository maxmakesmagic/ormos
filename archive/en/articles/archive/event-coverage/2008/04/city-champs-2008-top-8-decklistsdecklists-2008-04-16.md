You can test each decklist thanks to our [Sample Hand Generator](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/294). Just click on the card fan in the upper right of each decklist and you can see what your opening hand could be, along with mulligans and the first three cards you'd draw.

With the recent change to Constructed legal dates, *Morningtide* cards became legal in Extended decks on February 1. For a full description of the Extended format, [click here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrextended).

Decklists will be updated weekly during the PTQ season. The season runs from January 5 to March 30. To find a PTQ near you, [click here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/hollywood08-qualifiers).
