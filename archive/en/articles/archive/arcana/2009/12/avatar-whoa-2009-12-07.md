We showed off the 2010 Pro Tour card on [the **Magic** Pro Tour Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/MagicProTour) over [here](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=2934808&id=36573882851). And here it is again.

This handsome (and shiny!) card was given to attendees at the [2009 World Championships](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/coverage-2009-world-championships-2009-11-12), and it will be given to all attendees at 2010 Pro Tour events, whether they play in the main event or not. But this is Magic Arcana, so we'd like to call your attention to the art. This, of course, is new art for the venerable [Avatar of Woe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avatar+of+Woe), which originally looked like this.

You'll note that the new art clearly shows the same Avatar. This is because rk post is awesome. To close this out, let's look at the original art.

Very nice! And here's the complete art description given for the new one:


> an alternate illustration of your avatar of woe.

Why beat around the bush, right?
