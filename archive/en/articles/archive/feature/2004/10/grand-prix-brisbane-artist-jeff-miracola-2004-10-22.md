**Jeff Miracola** began his career as a professional illustrator in 1993, at the age of 22, after showing his portfolio during a trip to the GenCon gaming convention. One of the first companies to give Jeff work was Wizards of the Coast, Inc. for the role-playing game **Everway**. Jeff has since worked with FASA Corporation, Steve Jackson Games, Crave Entertainment, Mayfair Games, TSR, Inc., Hasbro, Inc, and Paizo Publishing. He has created hundreds of paintings for books, magazines, newspapers, video games and trading card games. His artwork appears on over 75 current **Magic: The Gathering** cards and can also be found in upcoming sets. Jeff lives in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with his wife and three children.
