After starting his career covering college football and basketball for ESPN.com, Greg Collins found a way to merge his love of sports and games into one job. He's been in charge of Magic event coverage since 2004. 






*Magic*'s return to Innistrad has a special place in many players' hearts. The same is true for the Wizards coverage team, as our first journey to the plane was when we kicked off our expanded Pro Tour video coverage back in 2012 with [Pro Tour *Dark Ascension*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/kibler-triumphs-epic-pro-tour).


As our cameras get ready to dive back into the amazing world of Vampires, Werewolves, Angels, and everything else that makes Innistrad great, here's a look at the major events we're covering during the *Shadows over Innistrad* season. Across a three-week span, we'll be going deep into the freshly rotated Standard format and *Shadows over Innistrad* Draft and Sealed Deck play.


The video coverage begins at [Grand Prix Barcelona](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpbar16) April 16 and 17. With many of the top pros already in Spain to prepare for the Pro Tour, this should be a fantastic first look at how to build Sealed decks and draft the new set. It continues at [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi) in Madrid, and then concludes with Standard at [Grand Prix Toronto](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gptor16).


To help tell the story of the Sealed Deck rounds in a more comprehensive way in Barcelona, the coverage team will be featuring three top players and their Sealed builds across Day One: No. 7-ranked Sam Black, No. 10 Fabrizio Anteri, and Pascal Maynard, fresh off his first Pro Tour Top 8. We hope that this new approach to Sealed Deck coverage will make those rounds more entertaining because you get to follow a few specific decks through the build process and see them in action across multiple rounds. Barcelona's coverage will also serve as a hub to bring you updates from [Beijing](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpbei16) and [Albuquerque](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpabq16), telling a more complete story about *SOI* Limited around the world.


For the Pro Tour, we'll once again be taking our cameras into a testing house, continuing the feature we started at [Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptogw) with the Pantheon. This time we're featuring the dominant team from Europe, Team EUreka. Their roster for this Pro Tour includes No. 5 Martin Müller, No. 10 Fabrizio Anteri, No. 16 Joel Larsson, No. 17 Martin Dang, No. 20 Brad Nelson, Hall of Famers Frank Karsten and Olle Rade, Matej Zatlkaj, Pierre Dagen, Oliver Polak-Rottmann, Immanuel Gerschenson, Magnus Lantto, Simon Nielsen, Aleksa Telarov, and Thomas Hendricks. Along with segments from inside the testing house, two members of the team—Zatlkaj and Karsten—will be providing their insights into the formats and their testing as members of the Grand Prix coverage teams bracketing the Pro Tour.
