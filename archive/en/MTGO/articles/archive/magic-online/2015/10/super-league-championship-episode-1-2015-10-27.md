Super League is a weekly stream on Twitch that shows *Magic* celebrities playing on *Magic Online*. Ever since July, we’ve been building up to the Super League Championship, which features the top finishers from Vintage Super League, Standard Super League, Modern Super League, and last week’s Last Chance Qualifier.


Speaking of last week’s qualifier, the last two spots may have gone to Lee Shi Tian and Kenji Egashira, but all anyone could talk about was the amazing match of *Magic* played by newly minted #No.1-ranked player in the world Owen Turtenwald and his teammate, now #No.19-ranked Reid Duke (whose ranking should go up again later this week, once the results from last weekend’s Grand Prix are added in). If you want to see two complete sickos playing a beautiful match of *Magic*, check out the video below.

The twelve qualified players will be divided at random into three groups of four, and the Group Stage of the championship will see them play each other person in their group once. After those three weeks of games are completed, the top two from each group will advance to the playoffs (and the top 2 group winners will receive byes into the semi-finals). No one knew who else was in their group when we all submitted decks yesterday.


Now that decklists are in, it’s time to reveal the groups and the first week’s slate of games, which will be played tonight:

Finally, we can also now reveal the decklists that everyone will be using for the Group Stage of the competition.
