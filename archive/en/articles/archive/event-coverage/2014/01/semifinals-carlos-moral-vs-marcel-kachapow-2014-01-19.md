In the second semifinal match to finish, Marcel Kachapow sat down at the table with his Tempo Twin, an updated version of the [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) deck Patrick Dickmann had already used to win the last Modern Grand Prix in Antwerp a couple of months back.


Facing him was Carlos Moral, playing Blue-Red Delver, a new-ish deck no one had on the radar before this weekend. That should, and probably is, going to change in the future ...

*Carlos Moral vs. Marcel Kachapow*
**Game 1**


Although Moral couldn't apply any early pressure, he, at one point, resolved [Young Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) and managed to keep it active for several turns, really showcasing the power of the young'un. An army of [Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elemental) tokens swarmed the battlefield and stormed to victory.

**Game 2**


This was quite a different affair. Moral had [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) for Kachapow's [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), and then [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) to flashback-kill a second Lavamancer too. The game seemed to go in a similar direction as the first.


All changed, however, when Kachapow cast and resolved [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull). The equipment was impossible for Moral to race and even more impossible (if that's possible, eh?) to handle conclusively. When he was forced to [Vapor Snag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag) an equipped [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), well, that was a pretty good indicator things were going downhill for Moral.

**Game 3**


The final duel was all about value and Kachapow had a definite advantage here, with [Electrolyze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze) and [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) to recast it. Although Moral fought back with [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) and [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) to generate some extra cards himself, he never really got his foot in the door. Without at least some early pressure, Kachapow's deck appeared to be well-prepared to fight Moral's strategy.


**Carlos Moral 1-2 Marcel Kachapow**
