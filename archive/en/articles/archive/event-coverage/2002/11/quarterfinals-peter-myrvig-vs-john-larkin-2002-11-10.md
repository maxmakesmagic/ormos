![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a383.jpg)It's the vet versus the newcomer in this battle between two Europeans. Ireland's John Larkin is making his third Top 8 appearance, whereas Denmark's Peter Myrvig is having his best Pro tournament ever.

Larkin and Myrvig played this matchup in Round 13—blue/black Reanimator vs. [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)—and Larkin won 2-0. Myrvig rebounded in Round 14, beating Markus Joebstl who had the same deck as Larkin, to make the Top 8, so anything will be possible.

[Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) serves two very crucial functions in both decks: card selection when combined with shufflers like [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb), [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition), and [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta), and as a way to hide critical cards from opposing [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy).

Both players spent the first few turns firing off a flurry of [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)s and shufflers to set up good hands. Larkin also had [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) for library manipulation, and dumped [Visara the Dreadful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful) and [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) into his graveyard. Myrvig cast a [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) on turn three which allowed Larkin to resolve a [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) on the following turn. Myrvig's hand turned out to be not very good after all, and Larkin was able to resolve [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) on turn 4, putting [Visara the Dreadful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful) into play. The Fiend had Myrvig's [Boomerang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boomerang) on lockdown, so the 5/5 flier wasn't going anywhere.

"Gorgon Legend!" cried the Irishman, who then added insult to injury by Reanimating the [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force). Myrvig made one last attempt to win by [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ing for [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) and two [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge)s, but when Larkin [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ed his own [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) Myrvig had no outs.

Larkin 1 – Myrvig 0

Myrvig sided in: 2 [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay), 3 [Engineered Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague), and 1 [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict).  
 Sided out: 4 [Memory Lapse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse), 1 [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), and 1 [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)

Larkin sided in: 1 [Llawan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llawan), 1 [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay), 1 [Volrath's Stronghold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath%27s+Stronghold), 2 [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy)  
 Sided out: 1 [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), 1 [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake), 1 [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor), 1 [Thrashing Wumpus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrashing+Wumpus), 1 [Rushing River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rushing+River)

Normally the Reanimator deck sides in four [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator) against 'Tog, but because Myrvig knew the decklists, Larkin assumed he'd be bringing in [Engineered Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague)s, which render the Infiltrators useless. Actually, Kai Budde and Dirk Baberowski (among others) had tested this matchup extensively for Larkin and probably told him what to sideboard.

Myrvig started in game 2, and had a [Counter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counter) for Larkin's turn-2 [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Larkin may have been able to sneak it in on the first turn, but decided he'd rather play around [Force Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike). Larkin whiffed with a [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) on the next turn and then Tutored for another copy. He was saddened when he saw Myrvig had hidden his one Edict with a [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and would have to play around it now.

Myrvig dropped a 'Tog on turn 5 and got one hit in before Larkin decided to get tricky. Knowing that [Llawan, Cephalid Empress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llawan%2C+Cephalid+Empress) was his best way to handle the 'Tog, he [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ed the Legend and [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)d her, sending Myrvig's 'Tog home. But what about the Edict? Myrvig decided not to respond to [Llawan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llawan)'s comes-into-play ability, and gave priority back to Larkin with an empty stack. So Larkin sacrificed [Llawan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llawan) to flash back the Therapy, forcing Myrvig to discard the 'Tog.

The misplay on Myrvig's part didn't matter, however, as he simply [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ed for his final three 'Togs, played one, and killed Larkin with it on his next turn.

Larkin 1 – Myrvig 1

Game 3 wasn't really a game at all. Larkin mulliganed a hand containing [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb), [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder), and four land, and it went downhill from there. Mulligan to five. Then to four.

The only land Larkin's four card hand had was [Volrath's Stronghold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath%27s+Stronghold), and he never developed any kind of board position. He scooped in six turns.

Larkin 1 – Myrvig 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a381.jpg)Further sideboarding ensued.  
 Larkin in: [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study). Out: [Volrath's Stronghold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath%27s+Stronghold).  
 Myrvig in: 4 [Memory Lapse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse). Out: 2 [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay), 2 [Engineered Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague).

Larkin [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed Myrvig's Edict on turn one and from there had no problem playing around the countermagic.

A [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) took a [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) was [Counter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counter)ed, and a second Fiend took a [Boomerang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boomerang). Myrvig did manage to get one 'Tog down and had just tapped out to put out a second when Larkin dropped the bomb he was holding: [Llawan, Cephalid Empress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llawan%2C+Cephalid+Empress).

With the coast clear, the three [Torment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torment) cards hit Myrvig for six a turn until he was dead. [Llawan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llawan) has definitely turned out to be one of the more brilliant sideboard cards in the format.

Larkin 2 – Myrvig 2

Myrvig sideboarded a little differently for the deciding game, putting 2 Plagues and the [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) back in, and taking out two [Force Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike)s and a [Memory Lapse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse).

The Dane had to mulligan to start the final game, and looked only moderately satisfied with his six-card hand. Larkin went right to work on him with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), and [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), putting Myrvig on the defensive.

Myrvig had to tap out for a 'Tog on the third turn, and that's when Larkin went for it: [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)/[Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) on [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force). Larkin flashed back the Therapy with a Saproling because he had to keep Myrvig from [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ing for [Boomerang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boomerang). But Myrvig had a [Memory Lapse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse) and then a [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) to find the blue bounce spell. He had taken one hit from the 7/7 and there were still three Saprolings in play when he bounced the Force, so he wasn't out of the woods yet.

Larkin had another trick up his sleeve: [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) HIMSELF, naming [Llawan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llawan). He discarded the 2/3 and then [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)d it, putting the 'Tog back into Myrvig's hand. The Saprolings swung in for three.

Myrvig had an [Engineered Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) for the Saprolings (there was some confusion over whether or not he named "[Squirrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel)" for the Plague, but because he didn't speak clearly, intent was used.)

[Llawan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llawan) swung in to knock Myrvig to three, and a [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) sealed the deal for Larkin.

**Final Result:** Larkin 3 – Myrvig 0

The match was clearly all about [Llawan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llawan). Larkin now faces Justin Gary in the semifinals.
