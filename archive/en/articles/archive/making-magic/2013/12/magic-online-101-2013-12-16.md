There are many ways to get help in **Magic Online**, and we'll be talking about some these during **Magic Online** Week, including an article on our Customer Support team you'll find here tomorrow. Today, we want to highlight a new set of tutorial videos on [mtgo.com](http://www.mtgo.com) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/wizardsmtg) that are great resources for new players.

**Magic** is a huge and sometimes complex game. With over 13,000 cards published, it can feel a little daunting, especially if you're brand new to **Magic**. **Magic Online** takes on the enormous task of wrangling thousands of cards, their rules, and their interactions into an environment where the player can focus less on the logistics of a game and more on strategy. Veteran players use **Magic Online** to vet new deck builds and hone their skills, and new players can get in and learn the game with the structured play and helping hand of the game itself. And, of course, **Magic Online** gives you a chance to compete in serious tournaments for prizes without leaving your computer. 


 But before you start playing, it's handy to learn how the **Magic Online** system itself works, and that's where our new set of tutorial videos comes in. 


 You'll find a set of five tutorial videos under " [How to Use **Magic Online**](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/digital/magiconline.aspx?x=mtg/digital/magiconline/magiconlineusage)" on [mtgo.com](http://www.mtgo.com), with a sixth video in the works. If you're a new player, watch these to learn the basics, and you'll be well on your way to entering tournaments.
