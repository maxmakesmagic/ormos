After having a breakout performance at Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar* and qualifying for the World *Magic* Cup, Ryoichi Tamada is still quite unknown to most of the world. The 30 year old player from Osaka is one of the most shy players I've interviewed. I caught up with him about *Magic*, his past performance and his future aspirations.


"I started playing around Odyssey while I was still a student," Tamada mentioned when I asked him about how he started playing *Magic*. It took him a number of years before he started playing more competitively having played in a handful of Pro Tours since 2010. His biggest success before Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar* was 27th place finish at the 2010 World Championships. "Because of my rank and my ability to go to worlds [via the World *Magic* Cup Qualifier], I started playing a bunch more." Playing more netted him his two big successes to date: winning the WMCQ in Kyoto and qualifying for the WMC, and getting second place at Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*.

While he might not have as much experience as some of the other members of Japan's WMC team, Yuuya Watanabe and Kenji Tsumura, he looks forward to practicing with them: "Right now it looks like we're all going to meet up in Tokyo before [the WMC] and practice there. We haven't talked too much, but that's what we're going to do."


Being a relative rookie to the Pro Tour, it was surprising to see him have the success he had at Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*. More surprisingly he prepared to the Pro Tour by himself. "I played a bunch of *Magic Online* to practice for the Pro Tour." Having this outlet to practice Standard and *Battle for Zendikar* draft was invaluable for the Osaka native. "Normally, though, I don't really play too much [MTGO]–maybe 1 hour a day." This weekend he continues playing the deck that brought him success on the Pro Tour–Jeskai. He made a couple of changes to his trademark deck archetype, but he wants to keep them secret.

Looking forward to the future, Tamada was excited: "[Next year] I just want to keep playing *Magic*," he mentioned. Why wouldn't he want to? After getting 2nd place at a Pro Tour and qualifying for what looks to be one of the strongest teams at the World *Magic* Cup, he's got only opportunity ahead of him.
