Remember how some of the *Lorwyn* lands paired off to show [a single piece of art spread across two cards](/en/articles/archive/tenth-edition%E2%80%99s-preview-lorwyn-2007-08-07)? Well, that happens in *Shadowmoor*, too. Observe Omar Rayyan's Plains and Island side by side:



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Plains1 | Island1 |



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Island2 | Swamp2 |



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Swamp3 | Mountain3 |



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Mountain4 | Forest4 |



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Forest1 | Plains4 |

That's pretty neat, right? But wait! There are also five more pairs, hitting the *enemy* colors. Which means that every basic land in *Shadowmoor* is part of a two-card diptych!
