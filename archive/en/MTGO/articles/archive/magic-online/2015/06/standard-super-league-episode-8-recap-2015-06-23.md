The regular season ended in spectacular fashion! Not only did it work out that the final spot in the playoff would go to whoever won the Week 8 finals, but we also got treated to one of the finest matches of *Magic* I have ever had the pleasure of watching.

Ultimately, it was Josh Utter-Leyton who emerged victorious over Brad Nelson to claim 3rd place in the final regular season standings, thanks to the one copy of [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) in his Esper Dragons list. That sets up a date with Tom Ross in this week’s semifinals.

The format for the playoffs is Unified Standard. That means both players need to bring three different decks with them and are limited to four total copies of a card across all three decks (other than basic land, of course). Josh and Tom will play best three out of five matches, where they first play each of their three decks in a pre-chosen order. Then they can choose freely which deck they want to play for match four and match five (if necessary).


Meanwhile, Owen Turtenwald waits in the wings to take on the winner in next week’s championship finale. Tune in Tuesday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time (UTC-7) on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) for the Standard Super League finals! Check [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online) at the same time to see the [decklists](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/standard-super-league-decklists) that players will be using in the upcoming episode.
