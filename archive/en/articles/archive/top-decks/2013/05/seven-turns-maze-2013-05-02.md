Come tomorrow, we will get our first glances of what lurks at the end of the Implicit Maze. But for now, what about some understandably excited speculation RE: the new set? There is some flash in the *Dragon's Maze* and some basic tools. There are cards that will give powerhouse decks headaches and future sideboard superstars that compare favorably to some pretty impressive historical heroes. Let's have a look at...



 
 
Wow, what a card!



Longtime gamers probably immediately zeroed in on the fact that half of this card is about equal to [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) (a contributor since the dawn of Alpha) and the other half is just a tad weaker than [Erase](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erase) (a respectable sideboard card). Put together? It's kind of a different take on [Rack and Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rack+and+Ruin) for similar mana. Not only *not bad*... really, quite good in the sense of flexibility, and sometimes a complete blowout (get your [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) *and* your [Staff of Nin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staff+of+Nin)).



![Rack and Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rack+and+Ruin)

 

*Where does this matter?*


[Wear & Tear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+%26+Tear) is going to be a potential sideboard card for any player who has access to both red and white. I don't think this card is going to generate a huge amount of unaffiliated traffic; but it is going to range from "useful" to "devastating."


When is [Wear & Tear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+%26+Tear) going to be useful? A player wants something to maybe interact with enchantments, maybe something to interact with artifacts? A "[Disenchant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant)" as it were? This card—again based on being "Boros" or better—fits the bill. And sometimes? You get the sick two-for-one! At that point [Wear & Tear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+%26+Tear) is probably performing better than reasonably expected.





![Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Voice+of+Resurgence)


 
Did I mention "Wow, what a card" yet?



What I like best about [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) isn't just how good it is (it is obviously good) but how not-obvious it is. Like, what is the first deck you would want to throw [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) into? Might I suggest a Naya beatdown deck?


Wait a minute!


[Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) doesn't get along very well with [Cavern of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls)... at least not in a deck with substantial Humans.


So [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) makes you choose. Maybe you can play it in your Naya deck... but maybe not in a dedicated Humans deck. You might have to rethink your mana base, or—gasp—play more lands than the average Blitz.


Think about this card in context for a sec.


What kind of defensive card might [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) hate most? What about a [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)?



![Fog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fog)

 

[Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) pretty much just attacks and blocks and makes little buddies that just attack and block (even if they get big). A deck based on [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) can lock down [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence)*and* all of its progeny.


So you can have this opponent who is [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)ging and [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)ging and locking down your Voice and all its little sidekicks. Atrocious, right?


*Except* that you keep making guys because the opponent is casting stuff on your turn, which in turn makes more guys.


What happens when you mix up the not-played-quite-enough *Gatecrash* foil [Skullcrack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack)? All of a sudden, those seemingly locked-down tokens might be looking pretty deadly. You might just get a one-shot start-and-finish.



![Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Skullcrack)

 

[Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) is an excellent attrition card. Think about how little downside there is to, say, putting a [Rancor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancor) on one. It dies... you get paid on both cards. What happens when your opponent casts a card on your turn... that results in [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence)'s death? Not just multiples but multiples multiplying size on each other's backs. Preexisting Naya decks might have, at present, a hard time casting [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence), but that kind of deck is generally pretty thin in terms of card drawing. [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) can give a deck without a lot of card advantage a little, you know, card advantage.


### Where does this matter?


[Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) is going to create a sub-game in Standard in a similar way to [Boros Reckoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner). For some players, that sub-game isn't going to matter at all; they are going to tap ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) for [Pillar of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillar+of+Flame) and kill [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) like any other creature. Other players might not have the relevant tool... but because their decks function a certain way they aren't particularly vulnerable to "a Bear" either...


But for a reasonable chunk of decks in the Selesnya, Bant, and Naya portions of the metagame, this card is going to be somewhere from "annoying" to the straight-up game winner. You don't have to think hard to imagine that. Card advantage, untold size, giving the opponent the old "you have removal but the cure is almost worse than the sickness" feeling at the pit of his or her stomach. *That's* when [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) looks most fun. Because winning is fun.





![Pilfered Plans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pilfered+Plans)


 
Did this card jump out at you as an excellent potential Constructed card?



Well, hither and thither, [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) has been a hit, generally as a two-of in various blue-black or Grixis decks. [Pilfered Plans](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pilfered+Plans) is kinda sorta [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination)-*plus*.


Obviously, you can use [Pilfered Plans](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pilfered+Plans) to deck your opponent (or at least move him or her in that direction)... but what is more interesting is using it on yourself. [Pilfered Plans](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pilfered+Plans) has excellent synergy with [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). Not only can you use it to "make your own [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter)" (where a 2/2 Elemental with flying is a 2/1 Wizard without flying) but [Pilfered Plans](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pilfered+Plans) also sets up your next [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). Not only does it put itself into the graveyard and potentially dig you to a potential [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), but it fills your graveyard (a little) for additional flashback options. Not busted, but [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination)-plus.



![Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Snapcaster+Mage)

 

*Where does this matter?*


This card is a solid option; it isn't an automatic four-of and it loses value in formats where it doesn't get to put heads together with a certain flashy 2/1 two-drop. But when you are going to start filling in certain checkboxes in Standard? [Pilfered Plans](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pilfered+Plans) is largely better than a card that has been a reasonable contributor... and should be rated as such.





![Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Advent+of+the+Wurm)


 
I just wanted to say, for sake of comparison, that on the occasion of my first Pro Tour seventeen years ago, [Nettletooth Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettletooth+Djinn) was played (in Standard), and finished if I recall in the Top 16; [Nettletooth Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettletooth+Djinn) was then the smaller (aka "fixed") version of Juzám Djinn.



Isn't it odd that we now live in a world where green and white have a card that is not only so substantially better than Juzám Djinn? This card has all of Juzám's size, but none of its specific downsides. It isn't just that this card is better on its face (no drawback), but the token has trample... and the creature itself essentially has flash!


*Where does this matter?*


When [Advent of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm) was revealed, Thea Steele made the comment that it will never be safe to attack into four mana again. *Ooh*, one might think, *[Advent of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm) can [Elephant Ambush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Ambush) the unwary*. But the reality is? That it is pretty much [Restoration Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel) territory already in Standard.



![Intangible Virtue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Intangible+Virtue)

 

This makes for an interesting deck-tuning question. Angel or Wurm? One of them thrives with other creature cards (especially other creature cards with interesting enters-the-battlefield clauses)... the other doesn't want to be blinked by an Angel. Ever. This card has tremendous value for the right deck; but that right deck isn't necessarily the GW[x] decks of Standard so far. Tokens strategies might love [Advent of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm) in a way [Restoration Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel) could never get any love, as this card works so well with populate or [Intangible Virtue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intangible+Virtue).


As a card, irrespective of synergies elsewhere, it's hard to find more value for the proposed effect at this price.





![Obzedat's Aid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Obzedat%27s+Aid)


 
This card is one of the most pregnant-with-possibilities spells in the entire set. [Obzedat's Aid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%27s+Aid) has the potential to do some of the most interesting things of any card: By being able to bring back any sort of super-expensive (and presumably super-powerful) permanent, it offers a discount on spells like [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker) or [Omniscience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience)... as long as you can get one of those cards into the graveyard.



So there is a price. You probably need to play a lot of the same kinds of tools we are used to seeing in other Reanimator decks. [Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch), [Grisly Salvage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grisly+Salvage), [Faithless Looting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting), etc. On the other hand? If you are already playing a deck that does that sort of thing... [Obzedat's Aid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%27s+Aid) can potentially go straight in for Rites-redundancy.

Grisly Salvage

Faithless Looting

*Where does this matter?*


There are two questions that must be answered with regards to [Obzedat's Aid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%27s+Aid). One of them is whether it matters that what we are reanimating is a creature (or not). If we are just bringing back creatures, this card is a poor [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites). It costs as much as the front half of [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites), but is a bit more annoying being both colors. That said, an annoying set of extra cards is not necessarily a bad thing. Ask any red mage who has supplemented [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s with [Volcanic Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer)s or straight [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)s. Sometimes you just want some more. Fifth or sixth [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) might be perfectly welcome (if only to get around [Nevermore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nevermore)).


Big deal: Let's make sure we are getting a substantial savings or additional efficiency out of it. In previous formats, one bonus on Junk Rites was how good [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk) could be in concert with [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites). Any [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk) could be a problem, but the two-for-one after two-for-one after two-for-one that decks had to deal with between [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk) (and its Beast) and the next two copies of the same card could be oppressive. We don't really have that here; what we do have is the ability to cheat out, say, an [Omniscience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience).



![Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Omniscience)

 

Did we just cheat out an [Omniscience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience)? Well how fast was that? To what degree did we have to bend our mana around potentially hard-casting it? Here is the big one: *So now what?* Crazy! Right? Because if you just cheated out an [Omniscience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) on turn four or so and you just said "go" instead of winning in spectacular fashion... maybe there was something off with how you put together your [Obzedat's Aid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%27s+Aid) deck.


Junk Rites, Four-Color Reanimator, and the various infinite Reanimators have already shown us a massive level of power and success when using these kinds of cards. We have to be vigilant when playing a potentially super-exciting variation that we didn't just trade "exciting" for win percentage. There was already plenty of spectacularly exciting to go around.





![Blast of Genius](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blast+of+Genius)


 
Speaking of Reanimator, I think [Blast of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blast+of+Genius) has a potential hole to fill in decks like that... decks that are up against a certain amount of hate, for instance, might see a lot of utility. Take a deck with [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand). Say that a deck wants to reanimate [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand)... isn't it cool to brain the opponent with [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) right before trying to bring him back?



*Where does this matter?*


Now, obviously, the default reaction to this card is unlikely to be "tool for Reanimator" but I do think that the potential is there, in particular for some new-fangled version with lots of colors. If you are going to try to do something crazy with [Obzedat's Aid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%27s+Aid), for instance? There is an implication playing with [Omniscience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) that you might want blue mana for hard-cast and red mana for [Nicol Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas). Junk Rites, unlikely (but they already have a midrange Plan B). New guy? Maybe.



![Tidings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tidings)

 

In general, though... this is kind of a [Tidings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidings) that can affect the battlefield. One of the scary elements players tapping out for a big card-drawing spell face is a non-effect on the board. You might *have* to tap out... but you're afraid about what's already there (let alone what is coming next from the opponent). [Blast of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blast+of+Genius) resolves that somewhat. Tap out... but maybe you are clearing an opposing threat at the same time. Your mileage may vary. The more a deck is tailored to take advantage of all parts of the [Blast of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blast+of+Genius) buffalo... the more value it is going to be able to give you.





![Teysa, Envoy of Ghosts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Teysa%2C+Envoy+of+Ghosts)


 
I don't know if you noticed, but I picked a card at every casting cost in *Dragon's Maze* to talk about. Okay I cheated on [Wear & Tear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+%26+Tear) a little bit but half of that three is a one if you grok. Teysa is at the top of this article's provocative curve.



[Teysa, Envoy of Ghosts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teysa%2C+Envoy+of+Ghosts) is our seven. Any time you are considering a seven in Constructed it is implicit that the card is powerful. Think about the fives we play, about how good a card has to be to compete with [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk), [Thundermaw Hellkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundermaw+Hellkite), or [Zealous Conscripts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zealous+Conscripts)—a seven is two *more* mana than these fatty boom booms. To get to seven in Standard you have to leap a mana past [Staff of Nin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staff+of+Nin) and to get to seven in Orzhov—white and black—you are talking about asking [Angel of Serenity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Serenity) to give up its seat at the mana curve table.


Does [Teysa, Envoy of Ghosts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teysa%2C+Envoy+of+Ghosts) fulfill enough of our seven-drop dreams to get us there?


I think the answer is... *sometimes.*

*Where does this matter?*


I am skeptical about knowing the metagame well enough to say that she will see much main-deck play. Your main deck generally has to take a good number of different comers and Teysa is badly outclassed in certain fights, given her cost. Case in point, Teysa is basically there to beat on creatures and some decks beat you with Planeswalker lockdown, rainbow [Door](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door)s to losing the game, or [Nephalia Drownyard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nephalia%2BDrownyard) decking. To them, contextually, Teysa is simply four mana more than a 4/4 threat needs to be.


Teysa is powerful and expensive, but she is not a big blunt object. As you might gather from the precision and implied expense of her little outfit, she is more of a surgeon than a jackhammer.


Teysa is built to beat on creatures. As a seven, she requires two bits of machinery, one obvious and one less so.


From the obvious side... you have to live long enough to hit seven. When you will be tapping out. Obvious again... you need to be able to live through the next attack and untap.


Now when that happens, Teysa still needs a little help. Teysa is sweet on offense/defense... [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) reborn. Teysa can attack through any blockers and live through any battle, but...


In order to keep getting money out of Teysa (or get any at all) you need to be able to withstand at least a wave of unblocked attackers. The subsequent 1/1 brigade will help you out after that but I am envisioning the need for an ongoing source of lifegain if you plan to keep taking it on the chin for more and more 1/1s. Luckily, Teysa is two-thirds in the [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)/Esper colors to start and is already the envoy to [Obzedat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat) (who will probably show up first).


Originally, I thought of Teysa as an anti-swarm card but I think she might be even more strategically oppressive to a deck that tries to win with one big guy. Your [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk)s, Thundermaws, selected Angels, or now [Ætherling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling)s. Because these decks work up a lot of effort to get into a "win with this" situation... but might never get a second attack.


So... what are your favorite new ones, twos, threes, and sevens hidden in the *Dragon's Maze*? Me? I'm bravely planning to send with this, this weekend:



![Unflinching Courage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Unflinching+Courage)

 

Roar.
