There were 285 cards in *Limited Edition Alpha*, the first **Magic: The Gathering** core set. Only 250 of those cards were reprinted in *Revised*. And only 211 of *those* cards were in *Fourth Edition*. With each core set, the number of cards that had been in every core set went down. Here are the numbers so far:

With last year's ***Magic** 2012*, [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) became the winner of Core Set Survivor. But what about the future? Will [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) continue to reign unchallenged in ***Magic** 2013*? To find out the answer, click here!

**No!**
[Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) is *not* in the ***Magic** 2013* Core Set! That means there will no longer be any card that appears in every core set. We've achieved 100% turnover.


### The New Core Set Survivor


So now, the Core Set Survivor game has to change, since we ran out of cards doing it the old way. There are two ways we can calculate things from now on:


**1. What Card Has Been in the Most Core Sets?**


Right now, it's clearly [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider), right? Well, maybe not! Through ***Magic** 2012*, the following cards had only missed one core set each:


* [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) (skipped *Ninth Edition*)
* [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) (skipped ***Magic** 2012*)
* [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) (skipped *Eighth Edition*)
* [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) (skipped *Ninth Edition*)

If any of these cards makes it into ***Magic** 2013*, there will be a tie for "what card has been in the most core sets." But that might not be as interesting as...


**2. What Card Has Been in the Core Set the Longest?**


Through ***Magic** 2012* (because we don't want to give away any more information about the upcoming ***Magic** 2013* than we have to), the answer is still [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider), which has been in thirteen straight core sets. But what's next? What cards that are neither basic lands nor [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) have been in the core set the longest? What's the longest current streak? Click here for the answer!

[Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) and [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) have been in every core set since *Sixth Edition*, making seven in a row. Next, [Lava Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Axe), [Mind Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), and [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) have been in every core set since *Seventh Edition*, making six in a row.
