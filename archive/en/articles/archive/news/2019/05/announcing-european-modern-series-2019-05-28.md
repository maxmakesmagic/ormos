Wizards of the Coast is happy to announce a new series of events taking place throughout Europe, targeted at Modern players. This series is made up of two types of events: European Modern Series Qualifiers and European Modern Series Finals.


**Qualifiers** – WPN stores throughout Europe will be running up to two qualifier events from the end of June to the middle of August. The winners of these events will qualify for the European Modern Series Final event local to their store.


**Finals** – There will be seven European Modern Series finals events. These will be multiformat events including both Modern and *Modern Horizons* Draft. The only way to qualify for one of these events is to win a European Modern Series Qualifier event.


European Modern Series Qualifiers
=================================


WPN stores throughout Europe will be running qualifier events. These will either be *Modern Horizons* Sealed or Modern format, with the option of the Top 8 being run as a *Modern Horizons* Booster Draft. The winner of this event will qualify for the European Modern Series Final event linked to that store (this is based on the country of the WPN store). Find out if there is a local store near you running this event by visiting [locator.wizards.com](https://locator.wizards.com/).


Players may not participate in a European Modern Series Qualifier if they are already qualified for a European Modern Series Final (e.g., a player who has already won a qualifier).


European Modern Series Finals
=============================


After this first stage of events, qualifying players will be able to participate in one of seven regional final events across Europe, with event locations to be confirmed soon. These will be taking place in August and September.


How each final will be fed by each region is detailed below:


* **UK Final** – Fed by qualifiers in stores from UK, Ireland, Jersey, and Guernsey
* **France Final** – Fed by qualifiers in stores from France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Luxembourg
* **Germany Final** – Fed by qualifiers in stores from Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands
* **Italy Final** – Fed by qualifiers in stores from Italy and Malta
* **Spain Final** – Fed by qualifiers in stores from Spain and Portugal
* **Russia Final** – Fed by qualifiers in stores from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Moldova
* **Poland Final** – Fed by qualifiers in the countries not represented above

These finals will feature three rounds of Modern, three rounds of Modern *Horizons Booster* Draft, additional rounds of Modern (with the number of these rounds being dependent on attendance), as well as a Booster Draft for the Top 8. Top 8–placing players will also each receive an SDCC 2019 promo set. Each player who participates in the finals will also receive a promo version of Arcbound Ravager (whilst stocks last).


Finally, individual finals winners will qualify for the Mythic Championship in Richmond, Virginia, taking place November 8–10.
