Last Full Week of Legacy Cube
-----------------------------


Do you like that one card, from that one set, and you just never see it anymore? Fear not, *Legacy Cube* is in full swing, and you may see it again! *Legacy Cube* is full of some of the best cards from across *Magic*'s history, working together in ways you can only experience in a Cube. And the fun doesn't stop for nearly a full month, ending April 25.


For more information on this update of the *Legacy Cube*, check out [designer Paul Cheon's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/march-2019-legacy-cube-overhaul-2019-03-19).

London Mulligan Testing
-----------------------


As a reminder, the London Mulligan is currently in testing on *Magic Online* until May 1. This mulligan is part of an experiment run by *Magic* R&D in their never-ending efforts to improve the game we all know and love. This will apply to all formats, in all events and casual games.


As MTGO is the best and largest way to play classic formats like Legacy and Vintage, this test will provide a critical mass of data to help R&D make a final determination whether to adopt this mulligan for *Magic* as a whole. And importantly, it will allow Mythic Championship competitors to practice their Modern game under the same conditions that they'll face in London.
