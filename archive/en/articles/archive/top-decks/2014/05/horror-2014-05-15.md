Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 







Welcome back to Perilous Research! This is a huge week for **Magic**: We've got [a Pro Tour to watch](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/journeyintonyx14#viewer) less than 48 hours from now, we just watched one of the most exciting [Modern Grand Prix](/en/events/coverage/parks-great-scape-minneapolis) events ever, and [*Vintage Masters* previews](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/Vintagemasters/cig) are doing a great job of getting our blood pumping. Today, we'll be taking a look at an exciting card from *Vintage Masters*!


*Vintage Masters* will give [**Magic Online**](https://accounts.onlinegaming.wizards.com/) players an opportunity to play with the most powerful and storied cards of the game's great history. Vintage has historically been a format that excluded the majority of **Magic**'s community. There simply aren't enough copies of cards like [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) to make the format accessible to the masses.


*Vintage Masters* is a **Magic Online**â€“only set that opens the door for all of us to get a crack at **Magic**'s most complex Constructed format. The Vintage format allows for use of cards from all sets, but there's a reasonably sized restricted list of cards that we can only play one copy of. Cards that involve dexterity, like [Chaos Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Orb) or [Falling Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falling+Star), are banned, along with other cards that no longer work in an actual game of **Magic**, like [Shahrazad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shahrazad). [Here are the full banned and restricted lists for Vintage.](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrVintage)


Today's preview card is a puzzle piece. On its surface, it seems like a convoluted hoop to jump through, but when surrounded by the right combination of cards it becomes a potent weapon. Many of you are already familiar with the horror about to be unleashed:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/pr/2014/Ichorid.jpg)
Sure, [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) has been a piece of some versions of Dredge in Legacy, and it experienced some success in Extended alongside [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) many years ago, but how will we be using [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) in Vintage? After all, wouldn't we be crazy to play a deck without the likes of [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall), [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), and [Time Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk)?


No, we wouldn't. [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) is a valuable piece to the Vintage combo strategy known as Manaless Dredge. Manaless Dredge uses cards like [Bazaar of Baghdad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad) to quickly fill its graveyard and attack strategies from a direction that's often unexpected. I'm just an aspiring Vintage Master, but I've always enjoyed a good deck-building exercise. Let's see if we can put together a Manaless Dredge strategy that can stand up to the power of other Vintage strategies.


The first thing we'll need is a hefty dose of the dredge mechanic. [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) is the most powerful dredge option available, so we'll definitely be playing four copies of that, [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp), [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell), and [Golgari Thug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Thug) are black creatures that work well with [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) while also filling our graveyard with the dredge mechanic.

Then we'll need some dredge enablers. [Bazaar of Baghdad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad) is clearly the most powerful card available in this department. In fact, [Bazaar of Baghdad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad) is so essential to this strategy that we'll be playing four copies, alongside four copies of [Serum Powder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Powder), and we'll be mulliganing very aggressively (often to two or three cards) in an effort to find our cornerstone combo-piece land. [Bazaar of Baghdad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad) is so strong that we may want to include a few copies of [Petrified Field](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petrified+Field) to return it to play in case we get hit by a timely [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) or [Strip Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strip+Mine).


We can hypercharge our dredging process with cards that allow us to draw without spending any mana. Cards like [Street Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith) and [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) can effectively give us draws that we can use to dredge without actually needing any mana. We can also play a single copy of [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) to [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return) for a game-ending septuple dredge on the second or third turn. [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) also happens to be a black creature for our [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) or [Unmask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unmask).

We'll need a way to win the game: The combination of [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba), [Bridge from Below](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below), [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return), [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid), and [Flame-Kin Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame-Kin+Zealot) is a tried-and-tested route to victory for these types of strategies. We'll be dumping our whole library into the graveyard within the first few turns of the game. In doing so, we'll find ourselves with a few copies of [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) on the battlefield. We can then sacrifice our [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)s to cast [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return), making a ton of Zombies in the process thanks to all the [Bridge from Below](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below)s in our graveyard. [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return) will target [Flame-Kin Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame-Kin+Zealot), which will give our army of Zombies haste and a nice power boost. We'll be attacking for well over 40 points of hasty damage as early as the second or third turn in many games.


This is Vintage, so we'll need to be disrupting our opponent so we don't get blown out by a timely [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), [Surgical Extraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction), or something else. Playing Vintage without a form of disruption opens us up to losing on the second or third turn to many different card combinations. [Unmask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unmask) is essentially a free [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) for a deck like this. [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) is another great disruptive option, especially on the play. [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) counters all of our opponent's Moxes, [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), [Lotus Petal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal), [Tormod's Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt), and [Engineered Explosives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) for zero, rendering many decks significantly neutered while not affecting our game plan. Our spells may be cast without paying their mana cost, but their converted mana cost is still as printed on the cards. [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) is an essential disruptive element here; it produces a lot of Zombies with [Bridge from Below](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) and gives us a green light to go off once we get a look at our opponent's hand.

One of the most attractive parts of this deck is that we don't need to acquire hard-to-find cards like the [Power Nine](/en/articles/archive/power-nine-2003-10-15-0) or [dual lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5B%22Land%22%5D&set=+%5B%22Limited+Edition+Beta%22%5D&rarity=+%5BR%5D) to compete. The deck as a whole runs beautifully.


Here's a recap on how we should be attempting to pilot our [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid)-centric Vintage creation:


Mulliganing properly is of utmost importance with a deck like this. We need to find our [Bazaar of Baghdad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad). [Serum Powder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Powder) should be used aggressively. It's OK to mulligan down to two or three cards in an effort to find [Bazaar of Baghdad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad). We can be greedy, though; if we have an opener with [Bazaar of Baghdad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad), but one non-[Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) or zero dredgers and little in the way of disruption, then it's probably correct to go to six cards. Our range tightens significantly on six cards, but [Serum Powder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Powder) gives us quite a few cracks at finding a nice starter.

Once we have our [Bazaar of Baghdad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad) opener, we want to play it and discard some dredge creatures after we've used any copies of [Unmask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unmask) or [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void).


Then, on our second turn, we can activate our [Bazaar of Baghdad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad) again, triggering dredge and discarding more dredge creatures. Then we should be firing off the [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe)s and [Street Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith)s we've found. This should find us some copies of [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba).

If we don't have the necessary ingredients to kill our opponent through the presumed disruption at this point, and we usually won't, we can pick apart our opponent's hand with [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and make some Zombies in the process with [Bridge from Below](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below). The following turn, we should be returning all possible copies of [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) from our Graveyard to the battlefield, dredging the remainder of our library, and using [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return) to get back [Flame-Kin Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame-Kin+Zealot) for a massive attack.


Vintage is awesome!
