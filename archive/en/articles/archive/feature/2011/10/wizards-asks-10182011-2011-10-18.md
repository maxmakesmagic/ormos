**Tom LaPille:** My most underrated card from *Innistrad* is [Nightbird's Clutches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightbird%27s+Clutches). It's pretty gross in general in any kind of attack deck, as most people can't leave back three or more creatures to block your stuff. 

![Nightbird's Clutches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nightbird%27s+Clutches)  
It's also particularly important to my favorite Limited archetype in the format, which is the [Rally the Peasants](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Peasants) white-red token deck. This kind of effect isn't normally that strong, but the reasonably costed second use is more than enough to get this card over the top for me. I'm willing to play two in most red decks that have an aggressive bent.
