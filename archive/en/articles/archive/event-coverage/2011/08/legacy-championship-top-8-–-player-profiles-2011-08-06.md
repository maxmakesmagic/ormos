Fish – it’s the most forgiving to mistakes and I had the cards.

Play-tested yesterday drinking beer with Brian Wegso. Thankfully, he played maindeck Tarmogoyf as maindeck Sower of Temptation came up big.

**How many times have you played in the Legacy Championships? Best Finish?**  

0.  
  
**What deck did you play and why?**  

Reanimator. Was playing MUD for a while and wanted to play Brainstorms again, plus I love Combo, so this decked seemed fun. So I said, “Why not?”  
  
**How and with whom did you prepare for this event?**  

Played some test games at my local store with people I came here with about three weeks leading up to this event.  
  
**What is your favorite part about the Legacy format?**  

It’s super-diverse. So that means there’s a myriad of decks to choose from.  
  
**What is your favorite card available in Legacy, but not Extended or Standard and why?**  

Brainstorm. It’s the best card in the format. I’ve won so many games top-decking it, putting lands back for spells, then shuffling the lands away with Fetches.  
  
**What is the best recent addition to Legacy?**  

Mental Misstep.  
  
**What is the best costume you’ve seen during your time here at GenCon?**  

10-ft Lincoln.

**How many times have you played in the Legacy Championships? Best Finish?**  

This is my 3rd – 11th place in 2009  
  
**What deck did you play and why?**  

Zoo, because I get to place with the most powerful spells ever printed in Magic, like Lightning Bolt and Steppe Lynx.  
**How and with whom did you prepare for this event?**  

Bernie Wen, Mark Sun and Korey Fay. We tested on our time offline and online.  
  
**What is your favorite part about the Legacy format?**  

Very many viable decks and viable strategies across every archetype.  
  
**What is your favorite card available in Legacy, but not Extended or Standard and why?**  

Wasteland. It’s the ultimate format-balancer.  
  
**What is the best recent addition to Legacy?**  

Not Mental Misstep.  
  
**What is the best costume you’ve seen during your time here at GenCon?**  

Some Asian guy pulled off Kung Lao from Mortal Kombat flawlessly.

Ian Rogerson  
  
**Age:**  

26  
  
**Hometown:**  

Dekalb, Illinois  
  
**Occupation:**  

Security Specialist  
  
**How many times have you played in the Legacy Championships? Best Finish?**  

First time (never been to GenCon).  
  
**What deck did you play and why?**  

Non-LED Ichorid – Even though I have been told it’s soft to Mental Misstep and Batterskull, I think it’s still strong and is the Boogeyman of Legacy. People take out their hate and hope not to see it and cringe when the see the Golgari Grave-Troll.  
  
**How and with whom did you prepare for this event?**  

I have played Ichorid since Future Sight. I have tried almost every version and this is the list I have come to use. I’ve been trying other combo lately (TES, Hive Mind, Four Horsemen) and decided for this tournament to go back to my standby. I.E. – I haven’t done any specific testing for this tournament.  
  
**What is your favorite part about the Legacy format?**  

The insane amount of diversity of viable archetypes.  
  
**What is your favorite card available in Legacy, but not Extended or Standard and why?**  

Not in my deck – Brainstorm. This card is so powerful and versatile. In my deck – Cabal Therapy. Very skill-intensive, but there is no better feeling than peeling a blind card from my opponent to win the game.  
  
**What is the best recent addition to Legacy?**  

I hate to say it, but Stoneforge Mystic and Batterskull. They are new staples.  
  
**What is the best costume you’ve seen during your time here at GenCon?**  

Justice League grow.

Recent Chemical Engineering Graduate – Hire Me!  
  
**How many times have you played in the Legacy Championships? Best Finish?**  

Once. This is my first.  
  
**What deck did you play and why?**  

NO-RUG. I like my Stoneblade matchup, and I have yet to lose to Hive Mind!  
  
**How and with whom did you prepare for this event?**  

Testing with Mark Larson and Bernie Wen. Grinding SCG Opens. There’s rarely a better place to practice and talk shop with other players. I’ve gotten help from reading Todd Anderson and Reid Duke, and advice from Mr. Alex Bertoncini.  
  
**What is your favorite part about the Legacy format?**  

How diverse and exciting it can be. I’ve seen about 30 different archetypes today.  
  
**What is your favorite card available in Legacy, but not Extended or Standard and why?**  

Natural Order! How many times can you cast a green Tinker? I like Sylvan Library too – card advantage!  
  
**What is the best recent addition to Legacy?**  

Mental Misstep. It’s drastically improved blue as (already) the most powerful color.  
  
**What is the best costume you’ve seen during your time here at GenCon?**  

Pyramid Heads from Silent Hill … creepy.

First-timer.  
  
**What deck did you play and why?**  

U/W Stoneforge. I played the deck I was most comfortable with.  
**How and with whom did you prepare for this event?**  

Mark Larson, Mark Sun, Korey Fay, Adam Tukel from Fine-Good, and Jack Grannen.  
  
**What is your favorite part about the Legacy format?**  

I like Legacy because you get to play with a large pool of cards that are all viable. Any deck can win.  
  
**What is your favorite card available in Legacy, but not Extended or Standard and why?**  

Force of Will because it keeps the “broken” decks honest.  
  
**What is the best recent addition to Legacy?**  

Probably Mental Misstep.  
  
**What is the best costume you’ve seen during your time here at GenCon?**  

Cloud from Final Fantasy 7.
