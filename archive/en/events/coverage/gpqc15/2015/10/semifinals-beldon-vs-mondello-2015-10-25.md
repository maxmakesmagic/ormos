Jake Mondello had a narrow loss in his first Grand Prix Top 8, a finalist appearance at Grand Prix Cleveland earlier this year. Now, back in his second Top 8 Mondello was looking to earn the title that slipped away.


Standing in the way was Omar Beldon, who rallied to the Top 8 after going undefeated on Day 1. It was his first Top 8 at a Grand Prix, and his first notable *Magic* moment yet. Like Mondello, this was Beldon's chance to break through to a finals showdown and shot at a trophy.


**The Decks**


Beldon wielded a deck similar to what two other semifinal competitors had found success with as well: Dark Jeskai. One of the premier decks of Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*, the deck could attack across multiple modes. With [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider), it was a fast and efficient rempo deck that backed up threats with removal and countermagic. With [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) and [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) it could grind out a controlling match, incrementally pulling ahead with card advantage and reusing its best options in the graveyard. Thanks to the free black mana off the combination of *Khans of Tarkir*'s fetch lands and *Battle for Zendikar*'s dual lands, [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom), [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) gave it both the “Dark” moniker and more potent tools for its arsenal.


Mondello however was the lone remaining that had taken a different path. Red-Green Eldrazi wasn't a deck on the map before Quebec City, and while others tried to make it work for the weekend it was Mondello that found the greatest success. With a slew of ramp spells from [Explosive Vegetation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Vegetation) and [Map the Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Map+the+Wastes) to [Nissa's Pilgrimage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Pilgrimage) and [Shrine of the Forsaken Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+the+Forsaken+Gods), Mondello was playing mosters like [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) and [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) to clear out the competition. With a smart suite of removal like [Rending Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rending+Volley) and [Seismic Rupture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Rupture) in the sideboard, Mondello's deck was built to bash in first with protection coming in one when needed.


**The Games**


Mondello led off the first game making plans with mana, finding [Shrine of the Forsaken Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+the+Forsaken+Gods) with [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) on his second turn. Beldon missed his second land drop, and played a tapped [Prairie Stream](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prairie+Stream) on his third.


It left Mondello to  explode with mana off an unopposed [Explosive Vegetation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Vegetation).


[Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) looked to turn things around but Mondello's fifth turn [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) annihilated the puny Human Wizard. [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) revealed just [Jaddi Offshoot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jaddi+Offshoot) in hand for Mondello but it didn't matter if the Dragon stuck around. Beldon made a [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) before falling to 4 life on Mondello's next attack.


Beldon didn't find anything to kill the Dragon in the end.

The second game featured Beldon leading off with Jace, Vyrn's Prodigy on the second turn. [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) and Jace's transformation quickly followed as Mondello just kept playing lands.


[Explosive Vegetation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Vegetation) resolved, putting him up to an impressive eight in a hurry. [Rending Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rending+Volley) handled the [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) – saving Mondello some life – as Beldon kept ticking his Jace up.


[Nissa's Pilgrimage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Pilgrimage) increased the mana even more for Mondello before Ugin, the Spirit resolved, removing Jace for “free” zero loyalty. More importantly, [Sanctum of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+of+Ugin) was sacrificed, and Mondello pulled [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) out from his deck.


The monsters were coming, but Beldon was prepared this time.


[Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End) was the end of Ugin, and Beldon dug in with [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths) for three. Beldon passed and Mondello played his tenth land to cast [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger). It exiled two sources of red mana from Beldon, but [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command) countered the Eldrazi and returned Jace to the battlefield.


Jace transformed again, and [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) number two put the pressure on Mondello to find an answer. [Explosive Vegetation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Vegetation) was his first step, followed by [Map the Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Map+the+Wastes). Mondello fell to 8 life on Beldon's next attack, then had his [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) countered by [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke).


5 life was next as Mondello drew into his second [Sanctum of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+of+Ugin). Playing it then casting [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) for eight mana the Sanctum triggered, finding [Ruin Processor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+Processor) – which Mondello thought he could pay for by playing a Forest that was actually his second land that turn.


The judge paused and backed things up, which left Mondello to pass the turn into [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) and [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom). Beldon had evened the score.

[Shrine of the Forsaken Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+the+Forsaken+Gods) into [Map the Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Map+the+Wastes) began Mondello's usual ramping path in the third game, but [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master) and [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) put the pressure on for Beldon. [Explosive Vegetation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Vegetation) pushed the land count higher after Mondello played [Sanctum of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+of+Ugin). [Rending Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rending+Volley) cleared away the [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider), but Beldon kept up four mana to represent any number of counterspells.


Mondello went for [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) anyway – which hit Beldon's [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke) – but it brought an [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) to Mondello's hand off [Sanctum of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+of+Ugin). Another [Rending Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rending+Volley) killed the Grand Master and Mondello went for a second Ugin first. Using the Ghostfire loyalty ability, Mondello began to burn away at Beldon's tall life total.


[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) at the end of Mondello's turn was a start, but Beldon kept his mana up. He dropped to 16 life from the next blast of Ugin and Mondello cast his final card in hand: Ulamog.


[Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command) hit the Eldrazi again, and [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End) ended Ugin once more. [Jaddi Offshoot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jaddi+Offshoot) and [Map the Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Map+the+Wastes) led into a 1/4 to blocker with and a [Haven of the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haven+of+the+Spirit+Dragon) sacrifice to get back the namesake Planeswalker, but Mondello was in trouble: [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) into [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) destroyed the Ugin and soon Mondello was facing down double [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider).


After drawing for one last turn all Mondello could do was shake Beldon's hand.


**Omar Beldon defeated Jake Mondello, 2-1.**
