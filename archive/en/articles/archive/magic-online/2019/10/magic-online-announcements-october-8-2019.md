Modern & Legacy Bonus Format Playoffs
-------------------------------------


For those of you who missed the previous format playoffs, we're holding bonus playoffs this month! To join, accrue 35 Format Points in Challenges and Leagues within a single format by its Playoff date—Modern on Saturday, October 12, and Legacy on Sunday, October 13, both at 8 a.m., then Vintage on Saturday, October 19, and Pauper on Sunday, October 20, both at 10 a.m.


The *Magic Online* Format Challenges continue every weekend for Modern, Vintage, Legacy, and Pauper formats except when replaced by Format Playoffs during scheduled Format Playoff dates.


Format Playoff events qualify you for the Format Championship in January that sends the top player to the *Magic Online* Championships and the tabletop Players Tour.

*Masters Edition* Flashback Draft
---------------------------------


Beginning tomorrow, October 9, and running until next Wednesday, October 16, you can draft original *Masters Edition*, starring original art from the earliest *Magic* sets. And it's using the original Draft style: this is no Phantom flashback. When you draft these cards, they're added to your collection. Entry options are 12 Event Tickets, 3 *Masters Edition* boosters plus 2 Event Tickets, or 120 Play Points.


For weeks listed in the [Alternative Play Calendar from Alli's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo/throne-eldraine-magic-online-edition-2019-09-18#altplay) as non-Phantom events, this League will begin at approximately 10 a.m. PT on the first day listed, which is always a Wednesday. These Leagues will be closed to new entries at 10 a.m. PT on the last day listed and ended no later than 2 p.m. that same day.

Alternative Play Calendar
-------------------------


For the *Throne of Eldraine* Alternative Play season, we're trying something new and different: a series of blasts from the past. And by that, we mean *way* in the past.
