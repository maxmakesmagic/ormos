*What's your favorite Draft format of all time?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** This is a tougher question than I first thought. While I do have a clear favorite, the last few years have been a great time to be a drafter. *Shadowmoor* was particularly fun; I loved drafting monocolored decks (red especially) and occasionally figuring out well into (or after!) a draft that my deck was different colors than I thought it was, and wither is a fascinating mechanic. Full-block *Shards* is also a lot of fun. Cascade is one of my favorite Limited mechanics ever, and with *Alara Reborn*, the third pack always feels like Christmas. And ***Magic** 2010* Limited is—well, I've said too much.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/activity/act222_packs.jpg)Overall, though, I'd have to vote for *Time Spiral* (with one, two, or three sets—take your pick). I (unlike some I've spoken with) really enjoyed what suspend did to the format; there was that wonderful feeling of impending doom when there were three big spells ticking down. Between the 121-card "timeshifted" set and the ridiculous number of different keywords and homages, every draft seemed to bring a radically different experience—something I put a premium on. Sometimes it was double [Gaea's Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Anthem), [Phantom Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm), and [Sprout Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprout+Swarm); other times it was double [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake), double [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink), and [Draining Whelk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draining+Whelk) (yes, both of those actually happened). One of the reasons I play Limited is to get a different game every time, and no format was more varied than that.
