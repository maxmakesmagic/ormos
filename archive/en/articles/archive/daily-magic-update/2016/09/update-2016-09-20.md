The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 20, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [Aetherflux Reservoir and getting to 50 life](#item9).


Today's Must
============


1. [*Kaladesh* Set Review: Commons and Uncommons](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-355-kaladesh-set-review-commons-and-uncommons/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

It's here. Oh is it here. All 4 hours and 45 minutes of it. Which, too be fair, I think is actually one of the shorter review podcasts from Limited Resources.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [*Kaladesh*: Top 5 White Cards](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/kaladesh-top-5-white-cards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive and Chaz V

Here's a new take on the set review. Instead of reviewing all of the cards, the MTGGoldfish duo are instead talking just about the Top 5 cards in each color. It's like the tl;dr of [Luis Scott-Vargas' card-by-card reviews](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/kaladesh-limited-set-review-artifacts/).


1. [*Kaladesh* Multiplayer Options](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13517&writer=Bruce+Richard&articledate=9-20-2016) | TCGPlayer | Bruce Richard

Richard is a master of multiplayer. The *Conspiracy* commodore looks at some mighty multiplayer options from *Kaladesh* to overmaster opponents.


1. [Pent Up Energy](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/alexullman-09202016-pent-up-energy/) | Gathering Magic | Alex Ullman

In other "niche" review news, Ullman naturally is on top of the Pauper review. He's most interested in energy, but he's also got some metal on his mind for this one.


1. [On *Kaladesh* and pronunciations](http://talinthas.tumblr.com/post/150663933967/on-kaladesh-and-pronounciations) | Finding the Path | Shivam Bhatt

Bhatt, also known as [@elektrotal](https://twitter.com/elektrotal/with_replies) on Twitter, provides a pretty cool pronunciation guide for *Kaladesh* words and cards based in the Indian language that formed the inspiration for words and names in the set. I know I've mumbled through a few of these, so this is super helpful to anyone who actually likes to talk while playing. So, hopefully, everyone.


1. [The First Vehicles](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2016/09/the-first-vehicles/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Zach Barash

Hipsters of the Coast lives up to the name with this "Oh, you like Vehicles? I remember when I was riding a [War Barge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Barge). You know, back when it was cool" article. It's actually a pretty fun look at previous attempts to mimic vehicles in *Magic*, from the aforementioned [War Barge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Barge) to [Predator, Flagship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%2C+Flagship) to proto-crew cards like [Hollow Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hollow+Warrior) and [Keldon Battlewagon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Battlewagon). Plus, let us not forget the great [Goblin War Buggy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Buggy).


What People are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> (Dan) \*sniff\* It's time for the LAST episode of Walking the Planes ([@WalkThePlanes](https://twitter.com/WalkThePlanes))! Episode 41 - "The End": <https://t.co/Xjff3XYHqt>
> 
> 
>  â€” Magic Europe (@Wizards\_MagicEU) [September 20, 2016](https://twitter.com/Wizards_MagicEU/status/778247599132381184)

The video is awesome and a fitting end to the *Walking the Planes* series. I'm glad I got to be a part of a few of them, and even happier that Nate and Shawn will continue to make awesome *Magic* videos in other ways.


1. [Tezzeret and the Phyrexian](http://sarpadianempiresvol-viii.tumblr.com/post/150658733134/so-tezzeret-was-with-the-lovely-phyrexians-last) | Sarpadian Empires Vol. VIII | Andrew Weisel

A ton of people have been commenting on this, but flavor Tumblr dude Andrew Weisel doesn't think the Phyrexians are involved here. Here's why.


Now we just have to wonder of Andrew is being controlled by Phyrexians and is trying to throw us off...


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Storming Off with Aetherflux Reservoir in Standard](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/storming-off-with-aetherflux-reservoir-in-standard/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Frank Karsten essentially looks at Aetherflux Reservoir and proclaims "Challenge Accepted!" And then he does a bunch of math.


The result of that math is an early version of a Standard "Storm" deck. Yeah. That's a thing that can happen with Aetherflux Reservoir.


Before we talk about it, head over to the [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/kaladesh) to check out the included *Kaladesh* cards if you're not familiar. (The Gatherer and associated updates are coming this week.)


So the deck uses a variety of cheap spells to interact with Aetherflux Reservoir, hopefully, gaining you a bit of life. Then, Paradoxical Outcome lets you bounce and replay all of those spells, gaining a ton of life and drawing a bunch of cards. From there, the plan is to hit 50 life. If you can't do that, you can buy time to [Crush of Tentacles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crush+of+Tentacles) and, hopefully, set up the whole thing again.


Will it work? Who knows. But the math checks out. Head over to [Karsten's article](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/storming-off-with-aetherflux-reservoir-in-standard/) to check out the deck list.
