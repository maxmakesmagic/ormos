Tom LaPille makes things. Some of the things he makes are card sets, like Dark Ascension and Born of the Gods. Sometimes he makes stories, too. Sometimes he makes unexpected things, like 16th-century Japanese clothing. He's probably making something right now. 





I started working at Wizards in June of 2008. It is now December in 2011. Two weeks ago, I said in this space that I was moving from **Magic** Ramp;D to **Dungeons amp; Dragons** Ramp;D. That is still true, and today will be my last Latest Developments article.

My favorite example of this from technology comes from [Steve Jobs's Stanford Commencement address](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html), in which he said that the earliest Macintosh computers were the first computers to have beautiful typography. While I can't prove his assertion, I used a lot of pre-Macintosh computers that had crude typography, and the Macintosh I used at my dad's high school was the first computer I had seen that had fonts that were nice to read, and most computers since then have had them as well. No matter how much credit you choose to give Steve for this, computer typefaces have been different forever since the first Macintosh.

I worked on **Magic** for three and a half years. In that time, lots of important things have happened thanks to raised standards. **Duels of the Planeswalkers**—the result of someone deciding that **Magic** should have a really good digital introductory product—created lots of new **Magic** players and brought many lapsed players back into the fold. ***Magic** 2010*—the result of Aaron Forsythe deciding that core sets entirely made out of reprints with bad flavor are lame—released to great success, ushering in a new era of core sets with good flavor and exciting new cards. Erik Lauer has built a very powerful suite of development tools that simply didn't exist when I started. We have also been much more careful about where we spend individual card complexity, making sure to spend our complexity points in the same places we want players' attention focused, which has sharpened the spotlight on the most important aspects of sets.

Although many of these changes came from my coworkers, a few came directly from me as well. I'm proud of my development work on *Masters Edition III* and *Masters Edition IV*, both of which I think are a big step forward in the technology we use to build smaller sets for one-set drafting. I have also been quite strident when an individual card does not tell a coherent story. Mark Rosewater said to several people in my hearing that I was the core developer who cared most about flavor, and I like to think that we make fewer cards like [Cloudchaser Kestrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudchaser+Kestrel) or [Windwright Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windwright+Mage) these days than we used to partially because of me.

We have higher standards for **Magic** sets now than we ever have before. *Innistrad* is a perfect example of this. We've never made a non-core set with mechanics and flavor this integrated before. There are classic horror tropes all over the place, with faithful expressions of those tropes in text boxes. The feel of each allied color pair's tribe is an attempt to express the way that creatures of that type act when they appear in the source material. Our standards were just as high on the development side. The draft environment is intricate, balanced, and awesome. The Standard environment is still morphing by the day, despite two months of Grand Prix, large third-party tournaments, and a [World Championships](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/worlds11/welcome).

Of course, people change over time just as much as games do. When I walked in the door at Wizards three and a half years ago, I was coming off four years of college during which about a third of my weekends contained long-distance travel to **Magic** tournaments. Somewhere during the past three and a half years, though, my gaming time shifted from card games to roleplaying games, and this year I found myself making as many trips to conventions to play roleplaying games as I used to make to play **Magic**.

While it's been fun to discover something new, I am also no longer the best person to keep standards for **Magic** high. Happily, Wizards also makes a well-known roleplaying game, and jumping over to work on **Damp;D** was a surprisingly easy transition to accomplish. I already feel that in my new role my level of standards is causing us to challenge the way we have done things in the past, and that tells me that I am doing the right work.
