What's rarer than a *Battle for Zendikar* expedition? A Grand Prix stamped Expedition!


When players draft on Day 2 of a Grand Prix, the packs have all been pre-opened and stamped by the judge staff to help preserve the integrity of the draft. For a long time, Grand Prix stamped cards have been desirable among a niche audience, but now they have an even sweeter collectable to search for.

*Alex Ball opened a [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain) in his draft.*

*William Li got a [Windswept Heath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath) in his, and he got it 5th pick!*
