![Arcane Teachings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arcane+Teachings)**[Arcane Teachings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Teachings)** – *Tenth Edition* uncommon. Sometimes, cards get new art to change the way they feel. One of the biggest changes for *Tenth Edition* was [Arcane Teachings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Teachings). The [Arcane Teachings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Arcane%2BTeachings) featured a bearded dwarven wizard writing a scroll, but the [Arcane Teachings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Arcane%2BTeachings) features a mage consumed with power and setting fire to things. Whoo!![The Ultimate Nightmare of Wizards of the Coast Customer Service](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=The+Ultimate+Nightmare+of+Wizards+of+the+Coast+Customer+Service)**[The Ultimate Nightmare of Wizards of the Coast Customer Service](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Ultimate+Nightmare+of+Wizards+of+the+Coast+Customer+Service)** – *Unglued* uncommon. With this card and [Ow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ow), *Unglued* had both the longest card name in **Magic** and the shortest. Both of those records would be broken in *Unhinged*, which had both [Our Market Research Shows That Players Like Really Long Card Names So We Made this Card to Have the Absolute Longest Card Name Ever Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Our%2BMarket%2BResearch%2BShows%2BThat%2BPlayers%2BLike%2BReally%2BLong%2BCard%2BNames%2BSo%2BWe%2BMade%2Bthis%2BCard%2Bto%2BHave%2Bthe%2BAbsolute%2BLongest%2BCard%2BName%2BEver%2BElemental) and [the shortest name possible](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=74252).![Maraxus of Keld](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Maraxus+of+Keld)**[Maraxus of Keld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maraxus+of+Keld)** – *Weatherlight* rare. Maraxus can be seen in [Desperate Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Gambit) fighting Gerrard. And he might win, except that you can see [Starke of Rath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starke+of+Rath) in the background. And in [Debt of Loyalty](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debt+of+Loyalty), we see that Starke has killed Maraxus.![Serra Inquisitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Serra+Inquisitors)**[Serra Inquisitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Inquisitors)** – *Homelands* uncommon. The [Serra Inquisitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Inquisitors) of *Homelands* are human followers of Serra, which explains why they get a built-in bonus when fighting black creatures.![Blockbuster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blockbuster)**[Blockbuster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blockbuster)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* uncommon. In the real world, a "blockbuster" is a kind of bomb. In *Ravnica*, we see it actually blowing up an entire block. You can do that when your setting is an actual city!![Suleiman's Legacy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Suleiman%27s+Legacy)**[Suleiman's Legacy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suleiman%27s+Legacy)** – *Visions* rare. Suleiman originally appeared in *Arabian Nights* as [King Suleiman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=King+Suleiman), with the ability to tap to destroy a Djinn or Efreet. Strangely, [Bottle of Suleiman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+of+Suleiman)'s effect *summons* a Djinn. This is because it's the bottle that Suleiman used to capture one and now he can let it out any time he wants!
 ![Standardize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Standardize)**[Standardize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standardize)** – *Onslaught* rare. The Oracle text for [Standardize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standardize) doesn't include "Legend" as a creature type you're not allowed to choose, because "Legend" is no longer a creature type. It still lists "Wall" to stay as close as possible to the original card, but it's not really relevant anymore now that "Can't Attack" is attached to the keyword "Defender" rather than the creature type "Wall".
 ![Pauper's Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pauper%27s+Cage)**[Pauper's Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pauper%27s+Cage)** – *Mirage* rare. [Pauper's Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pauper%27s+Cage) is a "fixed" version of [The Rack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Rack). The same idea has also appeared on [Rackling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rackling) and [Wheel of Torture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+of+Torture), although the most recent version was the original [The Rack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Rack), appearing as a Timeshifted card in *Time Spiral*.
 ![Kaleidostone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kaleidostone)**[Kaleidostone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kaleidostone)** – *Conflux* common. Originally, [Kaleidostone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kaleidostone) and [Armillary Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armillary+Sphere) were swapped, but Doug Beyer felt that the art with the prism in it looked less concrete and more appropriate for the mana-related card, so he switched the names and arts.
 ![Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Foresee)**[Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee)** – *Future Sight* common. Get it? [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee)? *Four*... *See*?
 ![Goblin Spy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Spy)**[Goblin Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Spy)** – *Invasion* uncommon. Unlike most spies, the [Goblin Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Spy) spies on his own side and broadcasts the results to everyone. Unsurprisingly, this card was never that popular in the top-level tournaments.
 ![Thieves' Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thieves%27+Fortune)**[Thieves' Fortune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieves%27+Fortune)** – *Morningtide* uncommon. The boggart in the art for [Thieves' Fortune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieves%27+Fortune) is looking through a window at four different possible futures, any of which could be the result of his trespassing. You can get a closer look at the art in [this arcana](/en/articles/archive/morningtide-sketch-quickies-2008-02-18).
 ![Prophecy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Prophecy)**[Prophecy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophecy)** – *Homelands* common. Although [Ihsan's Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ihsan%27s+Shade) has protection from white, he appears in the pupil of the eye on the white card [Prophecy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophecy). Spooky!
 ![Future Sight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Future+Sight)**[Future Sight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Future+Sight)** – *Onslaught* rare. The art for [Future Sight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Future+Sight) shows [Ixidor, Reality Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ixidor%252C%2BReality%2BSculptor) walking through his castle, seeing visions of himself in the future pleading with [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Akroma%252C%2BAngel%2Bof%2BWrath), battling [Kamahl, Pit Fighter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kamahl%252C%2BPit%2BFighter), and facing off with [Phage the Untouchable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Phage%2Bthe%2BUntouchable).
 ![Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker)**[Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker)** – *Conflux* mythic rare. There's too much to say about [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker). After an entire week devoted to him, we've barely scratched the surface. So we're just going to direct you to [Doug Beyer's feature article](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/22) and Bolas's own [Planeswalker page](/en/node/637441).
 ![Elder Mastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Elder+Mastery)**[Elder Mastery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Mastery)** – *Conflux* uncommon. Nicol Bolas is not averse to giving his minions a small amount of power so that they can serve him better. In the art for [Elder Mastery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Mastery), a necromancer has sprouted wings and is presumably about to soar forth and perform evil deeds on Bolas's behalf.
 ![Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cruel+Ultimatum)**[Cruel Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum)** – *Shards of Alara* rare. [Cruel Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum) hinted at an unfinished cycle: the other four Ultimatums had the four *Shards of Alara* planeswalkers in their art. The obvious assumption was that there was a missing black-aligned planeswalker, but the "higher power" alluded to in the flavor text turned out to mean the legendary blue-black-red character already known to be a planeswalker!
 ![Imp's Mischief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Imp%27s+Mischief)**[Imp's Mischief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imp%27s+Mischief)** – *Planar Chaos* rare. Nicol Bolas's reach spans the multiverse and he shows up in the most unlikely places. Whenever there's a time rift, Bolas is probably involved in some way. So it's no surprise that although he wasn't officially part of the *Planar Chaos* storyline, he stops by to deliver [Imp's Mischief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imp%27s+Mischief)'s flavor text.
 ![Nicol Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nicol+Bolas)**[Nicol Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas)** – *From the Vault: Dragons* rare. The flavor text on the *From the Vault: Dragons* version of [Nicol Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas) refers to it as "Dominaria's most ancient evil." It's certainly a recurring villain, since its original appearance in *Legends* was followed by *Chronicles* and the *Time Spiral* timeshifted cards.
 ![Magus of the Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Magus+of+the+Coffers)**[Magus of the Coffers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Coffers)** – *Planar Chaos* rare. The [Magus of the Coffers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Coffers) is, of course, a reference to *Torment*'s [Cabal Coffers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Coffers). But did you notice that the Magus is actually standing in the very same coffers, many centuries later?
 ![Jhoira's Toolbox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jhoira%27s+Toolbox)**[Jhoira's Toolbox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhoira%27s+Toolbox)** – *Urza's Legacy* uncommon. Lists of the crew of the *Weatherlight* often neglect Jhoira, who was captain before Gerrard. And as you can see from her toolbox, she liked to combine the aesthetic and the utilitarian, which may explain why she had such a [Urza's Blueprints](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Urza%2527s%2BBlueprints).
 ![Souls of the Faultless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Souls+of+the+Faultless)**[Souls of the Faultless](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Souls+of+the+Faultless)** – *Guildpact* uncommon. Originally concepted as "Souls of the *Vaultless*", the name had to be changed when the flavor text came in referring to nobility rather than a lack of storage space. Note, however, that the original art was used. And sure enough, these souls appear to lack vaults!
