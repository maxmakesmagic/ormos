Grab two friends and join in the fun at what is sure to be one of the biggest events on the 2013 **Magic** calendar. 


Utrecht, the fourth biggest city of The Netherlands, was once the capital of Kingdom Holland. It is currently the most booming city of the country. Utrecht is known as a student city with a large population of young, single people. This results in a great nightlife with many places to dance, drink, and eat. 


Don't forget to go up the Dom Tower, the highest church tower in the Netherlands, or relax in the cloister gardens next to it. Or perhaps you want to rent a canal bike and pedal your way around the canals? In the evening, be sure to check out the Oudegracht lower docks. 


Best of all, there are many stores near the Oudegracht that sell board games, card games, war games, role-playing games, and fantasy and science-fiction books.
