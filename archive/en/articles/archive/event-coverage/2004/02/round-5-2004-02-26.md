Tsuyoshi Fujita vs. Kai Budde
-----------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob04/r5fm1_1.jpg)Strangely enough, Kai Budde hasn't won a Pro Tour this season. He came into this round at 4-0, and is in a good position to fix that anomaly. Momentum is certainly on his side, as he's coming off a huge Grand Prix win in Madrid last week, beating a record setting field of 1353. Tsuyoshi Fujita was the first Japanese player to make a Pro Tour Top 8, and some have him pegged as the man who will be the first Japanese Pro Tour Champion. He's currently 3-1 and got paired up this round, and a win here will go a long way towards helping him make a run at the Top 8.


### Game 1


Budde cycled a [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) and played [Pyrite Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb), and Fujita had no plays until turn four when he brought out [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum). It died to [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt), and Budde attacked for one with Blinkmouth Nexus, missing his fourth land drop. Fujita summoned [Arc-Slogger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger), and Budde cycled another Sphere hoping to find a land, but it didn't come. He took a point of mana burn, and the [Arc-Slogger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger) shot him for more damage. A second Slogger followed, and Budde finally found a fourth land to play a Simulacrum. A Slogger shot it down on end step, and [Pulse of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Forge) got through the last points of damage.

### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob04/r5fm1_2.jpg)Budde mulliganed down to six. He cycled through two Spheres, played a Talisman but got mana stalled once again, as Fujita played a pair of Simulacrums. Budde had found a fourth mana source, but it was a [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) and kept his development stunted. He used [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) to kill one of the Simulacrums, and Fujita used two [Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain)s and [Echoing Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Ruin) all in one turn to completely destroy all of Budde's mana sources except one- a [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) finished it.
