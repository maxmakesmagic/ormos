Seven different formats. Sixteen individual competitors. More than seventy teams from around the world. A coverage team that numbers in the dozens. Five days of live coverage. There is going to be nothing else like Worlds Week during the tournament season, and it will all start coming to you live on Wednesday, with wall-to-wall coverage straight through to the awards ceremony on Sunday, when we will crown the [2013 World Champion](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/worldchamp/2013/info) and [World **Magic** Cup winners](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtg/event/worldmagiccup13).
