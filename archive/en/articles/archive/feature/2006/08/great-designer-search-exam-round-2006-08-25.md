**To apply, you need to write a 250-350 word essay for each of the ten questions below. If any question is under or over the required length, the entire test may be discarded.** 

1. Introduce yourself and explain why you are a good fit for this internship.
2. Explain three positive ways "mana screw" affects **Magic**.
3. Name a popular, existing mechanic and explain how you would make it better.
4. From a design standpoint, what was the best thing about the *Champions of Kamigawa* block?
5. From a design standpoint, what was the worst thing about the *Ravnica* block?
6. We design cards for three player psychographics: Timmy, Johnny and Spike. In the average set, who should the most cards be designed for? Why? Who should the fewest cards be designed for? Why?
7. Imagine you must eliminate a card type (artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land or sorcery) from **Magic**. Which one would you choose and why?
8. You stumble upon a time machine and travel back to the early 90's. What is the one change you would recommend Richard Garfield make with Alpha? (You must recommend a change.)
9. You are forced to move counterspelling out of blue. What color do you move it to and why?
10. What is **Magic** design currently doing wrong? How would you do it right?
