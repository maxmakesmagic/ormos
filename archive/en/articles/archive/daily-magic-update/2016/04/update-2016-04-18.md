The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 18, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by a weekend full of *Magic* news, content, and art.


The Weekend's Top Moments
=========================


1. [Top Moments of Grand Prix Beijing, Barcelona, and Albuquerque](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/top-moments-grand-prix-beijing-barcelona-and-albuquerque-2016-04-17) | Wizards of the Coast Event Coverage Staff

If you have the ability to read just one article about this weekend's Grand Prix, this is it. Summarizing the key moments from this triple-Grand Prix weekend is no mean feat, but this article does it—and gives you a taste of what you might have missed if you couldn't tune in over the last couple days.


There were a number of good articles from Grand Prix coverage worth checking out if you've got a little more time as well.

1. [Max McVety wins the StarCityGames.com Columbus Invitational](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/160416_columbus.html)

When Gerry Thompson made the Top 8 of the invitational, he quickly became the internet's favorite to win the whole thing. But when [he went down in the quarterfinals](https://twitter.com/G3RRYT/status/721768988691312642), the door was open for the only other Humans player in the Top 8 to crash the party. Max McVety overcame the deck of the tournament—Bant Company—in the finals to claim the trophy, the prizes, and the instant celebrity that comes with an invite to the Player's Championship. Don't let it get to you, Max. Stay humble.


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [Modern Classic Results](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=28&start_date=04/15/2016&end_date=04/17/2016&event_ID=36) | StarCityGames.com

While *Shadows over Innistrad* was the focus of the weekend, StarCityGames.com also held a [Modern event](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=28&start_date=04/15/2016&end_date=04/17/2016&event_ID=36) (and [Legacy](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=3&start_date=04/15/2016&end_date=04/17/2016)) that showcased the format's diversity. Won by Charles Porges's Zoo deck, the Top 8 consisted of eight completely different archetypes, and of the Top 16, only two decks had multiple copies. If you love Modern, this is a pretty good indication that the format is as diverse as ever.


1. [The *Magic* Art of Wayne Reynolds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqz-MyUAdV8) | TheMagicManSam

The Magic Man Sam only does videos every once in a while, but when he does, they're certainly worth watching. In this one, Sam teaches the finer points of Wayne Reynolds, complete with quizzes to hone your Reynolds-spotting abilities. Slick, clean, and always on point, videos from The Magic Man Sam are some of the best the internet has to offer.

After Those, Read Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [LR's *Shadows over Innistrad* Audio Review Library](http://www.channelfireball.com/clickable-set-review/) | ChannelFireball

This is really cool and quite useful if you're into the Limited set reviews from Limited Resources. Basically, instead of wading through the entire set review for four days or however long that podcast is, you can click on individual cards to hear the audio section that's just about that card. That way you don't have to spend your time listening to why [Chaplain's Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaplain%27s+Blessing) is not a card you want to play.


1. [Top 5](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/top-5-2/) | ChannelFireball | Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa

Paulo ranks a bunch of things in his Top 5s. Mostly *Magic* stuff, but not entirely (Top 5 books he's looking forward to reading, for example). Entertaining as always.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

Fabrizio Anteri's fifth win might have been the big story out of [Grand Prix Barcelona](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbar16), but a double-Top 8 from the Peach Garden Oath—a trio of close, top players consisting of William Jensen, Reid Duke, and Owen Turtenwald—was quite noteworthy as well. Jensen and Duke, in this case, were the two-thirds of the group who played late into the day on Sunday. They're already some of the best at the game, but when their Limited game is this on-point right before a [Pro Tour](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi), you have to expect big things.

To most people who play *Magic*, pro levels—Silver, Gold, and Platinum—mean very little. You can't trade them for your favorite card, they don't affect Friday Night *Magic*, and you definitely can't use them to beat your friend Jake's stupid red deck.


But to those who make sustained success on the Pro Tour their goal, Gold means everything. Gold is the first step toward becoming a longtime, thriving pro. Earning Gold status means qualification for every Pro Tour the rest of the season and next. It means paid flights to Pro Tours and, most importantly, it means not having to requalify any time soon. Gold is the level you need to hit to really be a Pro *Magic* player, and for many like Brian Braun-Duin, it's the culmination of a lot of hard work and reaching for your goals.


You'll be hearing a lot about levels with [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi) this weekend, and it's helpful not to think of them as levels that get a player X things or Y invites—it's best just to think of them as players hitting their goals and, for some, realizing long-held dreams.


1. [Statement on GP Barcelona Top 8 Advancement Issue](http://magic.wizards.com/events/coverage/gpbar16/statement-on-gp-barcelona-top-8-advancement-issue-2016-04-17)

If you haven't heard about this yet or have only heard bits and pieces, the link above tells you everything you need to know. Essentially, a software issue led to a player who should have been in the Top 8 of Grand Prix Barcelona—Jonas Friberg—missing out on the Top 8. As compensation, he was granted an additional Pro Tour invite, the flight, and a prize payout equivalent to making the Top 8. You can see most of the [discussion on the topic here](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4f8sfb/statement_on_gp_barcelona_top_8_advancement_issue/).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Bant Company](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=101064)

It may not have won the whole thing, but it was certainly the most represented Standard deck over the weekend. Plus, it has the most on-the-nose name [that also happens to be a pun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMKtiS6UEQ). That's some quality deck naming right there.


*Plus*, it might just be the best deck in Standard.


This is the version that Craig Krempels used to take 2nd place at the [StarCityGames.com Invitational](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=1&start_date=01/24/2016&end_date=04/17/2016&start=1&finish=8&event_ID=21) this past weekend, and the approach is pretty straight forward even if gameplay isn't necessarily. The deck has as many value creatures costing three mana or less as it can pack in, and then it plays [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company). Creatures like [Bounding Krasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bounding+Krasis) and [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) keep the battlefield under control, while [Duskwatch Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskwatch+Recruiter) provides card advantage, [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) beats down, and [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) cleans up any messes. The deck is flexible, has a decent mana base for a three-color deck, and gets to play [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), possibly the most powerful spell in Standard.


The question that will be posed this weekend at [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi) is whether another deck or strategy can consistently beat Bant Company. Because there is virtually zero chance it won't show up in some form or another.
