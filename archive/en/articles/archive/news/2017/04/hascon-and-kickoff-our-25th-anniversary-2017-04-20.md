[HASCON](https://hascon.hasbro.com/)—Hasbro's first-ever convention—is coming September 8–10 to Providence, Rhode Island, and *Magic* has a few special events planned that you won't want to miss.


As *Magic* celebrates its 25th Anniversary, we'll be kicking off a year-long celebration full of exciting products and experiences at HASCON, including an old-school Prerelease of *Iconic Masters*—a set you are just hearing about for the first time right now.


*[Iconic Masters](http://magic.wizards.com/en/products/iconic-masters)* offers players a tour through some of the most iconic cards in *Magic* history. Featuring new artwork on many cards, the set brings an array of Angels, Sphinxes, Demons, Dragons, and Hydras alongside some of our favorite and most memorable spells over the game's entire history. *Iconic Masters* is truly a celebration of *Magic*'s 25 years. Every box contains 24 booster packs of 15 cards each, including one premium card in every pack—perfect for drafting with your friends.


*Iconic Masters*, which is being released as part of *Magic*'s 25th Anniversary celebration, does not actually release until November 17, but that's what makes the event at HASCON so special. Back when *Magic* was still young, Prereleases used to be experiences that players entered into without knowing a single card in the set. Previews didn't exist, and Prerelease participants were experiencing the cards for the first time.


So the first people to play with *Iconic Masters* will also be the first people to see the cards in public!


In addition to kicking off our 25th Anniversary, HASCON will also prominently feature *Ixalan*, *Magic*'s next large set, next new world, and the block that will take us into 2018. Look for more details on *Ixalan* in our June product announcement that will focus on all the big news that will take us through our 25th Anniversary.


We'll also have events, panels, play experiences, and more coming at HASCON, but we're keeping those secret for now. To find out, you'll just have to join in!
