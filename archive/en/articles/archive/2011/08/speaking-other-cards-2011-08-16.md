There are cards in **Magic** that refer to other cards. Cards like, for example, [Arachnus Spinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Spinner):

Â 

There are also cards that refer to groups, like [Urza's Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Mine), [Power Plant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Plant), and [Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower).

This sort of thing has been going on for a long, long time in **Magic**:

Now! Can you guess the *very first* card in **Magic** to refer to other cards in its text? Think about your answer and click here.


Did you say [Rohgahh of Kher Keep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rohgahh+of+Kher+Keep) from *Legends*?

If you did, sorry! That is *not* the answer! The actual answer is from *Limited Edition Alpha*, the very first appearance of **Magic** back in 1993.

Yes! The Alpha printing of [Gloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=66) called out the Circles of Protection by name! In the *Revised* printing, this was changed.
