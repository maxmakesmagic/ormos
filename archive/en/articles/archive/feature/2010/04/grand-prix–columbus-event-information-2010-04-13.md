Grand Prix–Columbus offers you a fantastic opportunity. Not only is Columbus centrally located, but Columbus is an affordable city— just what you need in today's economy. Plus, you'll get friendly Midwestern hospitality. Thousands of hotel rooms and hundreds of restaurants are just a short walk from the venue.

*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings.

### Things to See and Do


Columbus is fortunate to have a dynamic downtown, a wonderfully bohemian arts district, a lively theater and music scene, and top-notch museums. It's also the home of The Ohio State University (never leave off that "The"), which on football weekends is a Mecca for red-jersey-clad fans and an upper-echelon academic institution the rest of the year.


 In downtown Columbus alone, you'll find more than 100 restaurants offering most every kind of cuisine. 


 You can touch a real, massive iceberg and see 20-plus artifacts on exhibit for the first time anywhere at "Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition" thru Sept. 6, 2010 at [COSI](http://www.cosi.org/). 


 Visit the world renowned [Columbus Museum of Art](http://www.columbusmuseum.org/). 


 Watch polar bears as they frolic underwater and swim overhead as you walk through an acrylic tunnel under their huge pool. Polar Frontier opens this spring at the [Columbus Zoo and Aquarium](http://www.colszoo.org/). 


 Climb aboard the Santa Maria, the world’s most authentic replica of Christopher Columbus’ ship. Learn about the teamwork it took to survive while crossing the Atlantic. 


 Go birding at the [Grange Insurance Audubon Center](http://grange.audubon.org/), which opened in 2009 as one of the first Audubon centers close to the core of a major American city.
