**Build Notes**


*Magic Origins* comes with exciting client updates to improve clarity of game events. A feature has also been added to prevent players from making decisions that would negatively impact them.


**General**


* Phantom Points have been retired and replaced by Play Points. All Phantom Points in player accounts have been replaced at the rate of 6 Play Points for each Phantom Point removed. Learn more about what Play Points can be used for [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/august-2015-constructed-event-changes-2015-07-20).
* General | If a user logs out and back in during an event, locked cards are no longer treated as not being in the user’s collection.

* Free Trial | The Free Trial has been updated to now offer decks featuring *Magic Origins*.
* Collection | The New Player Kit that comes with a new account has been updated.
* Account Sign Up | The account sign up page has been updated with *Magic Origins* images and text reflecting the changes to the New Player Kit.

**Gameplay**


* Duel Scene | [All Sun’s Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Sun%E2%80%99s+Dawn) no longer occasionally crashes the game when choosing targets.
* Duel Scene | Colored mana generated from [Crucible of the Spirit Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+the+Spirit+Dragon)’s third ability can now correctly be used to pay generic mana costs.
* Duel Scene | Paying costs for attacking and blocking has been updated to provide users with clearer information about their options.
* Duel Scene | Abilities that provide users with many options for producing mana in combinations of colors have been simplified, making cards like [Smokebraider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokebraider) easier to use.

* Duel Scene | [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) has been fixed. Users can now correctly choose to fail to find while not hellbent.
* Duel Scene | Players who control creatures with conflicting blocking requirements, such as a [Mogg Flunkies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Flunkies) that has been targeted by [Provoke](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Provoke), can now correctly declare blockers.
* Duel Scene | [Sundering Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) no longer occasionally resets the game during resolution of its triggered ability.

**Look and Feel**


* Duel Scene | Animations in the Duel Scene have been updated to show more frames as cards transition between zones while also enhancing performance of animations. See Alli Medwin’s upcoming article on 7/27 for more information on these changes.
* General | Premium cards have a new treatment that both looks better and uses less system resources. See Alli Medwin’s upcoming article on 7/27 for more information on these changes. You can turn these animations on by going to the Account Scene and clicking the “Animate Foil Treatment” button.
* General | Double-faced cards and planeswalkers have each received both performance enhancements and visual enhancements.

***Magic Origins* Known Issues**


**Gameplay Issues**


* Collection | When zoomed, *Magic Origins* planeswalkers display the incorrect card symbol.
* Duel Scene | Casting any red instant or sorcery automatically removes mana generated from [Pyromancer's Goggles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Goggles) if the mana is already floating in the user’s mana pool.
* Duel Scene | Creatures selected for the activated ability granted by [Consecrated by Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+by+Blood) do not have a red highlight around the card. The number of creatures remaining to sacrifice is also incorrectly not displayed in the prompt box.
* Duel Scene | [Hallowed Moonlight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Moonlight) does not create an ability in the effects zone.
* Duel Scene | [Murder Investigation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murder+Investigation) does not display “X equals” blue rules text on the stack.
* Duel Scene | The delayed triggered ability of [Liliana, Defiant Necromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+Defiant+Necromancer) incorrectly does not display association arrows with creatures sent to the graveyard.
* Duel Scene | The first loyalty ability of [Gideon, Battle-Forged](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Battle-Forged) removes attacking requirements from creatures.
* Duel Scene | The game log does not list the seven cards revealed by [Talent of the Telepath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talent+of+the+Telepath).
* Duel Scene | The mana ability of [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground) and similar cards incorrectly provides mana when the enchanted permanent is tapped for zero mana.
* Duel Scene | Using the activated ability of [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) when five or fewer cards are in the graveyard displays a placeholder string in the game log.

**Client Issues**


* Duel Scene | In some circumstances, users are not allowed to choose the order of multiple replacement effects.
* Duel Scene | [Nissa, Sage Animist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Sage+Animist)'s third loyalty ability has an extra apostrophe in the text.
* Duel Scene | The stack window incorrectly resizes only vertically and not horizontally.
* Duel Scene | When [Sakashima the Imposter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakashima+the+Imposter) copies a [Timberpack Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberpack+Wolf), it does not get +1/+1 for other [Timberpack Wolves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=398445).

**Commander Issues**


* Duel Scene | In a Commander game, a *Magic Origins* planeswalker that is the player’s commander will not return to the battlefield transformed when its owner chooses to send it back to the command zone.
* Duel Scene | We planned to implement the Commander rule commonly referred to as the “tuck rule” with the *Magic Origins* release during the July 22 downtime. This rule, which allows a player to put his or her commander in the command zone if it would go the library or hand, is proving more difficult than originally expected to implement. Because of this, the Commander change will not go live at this time. We want to take time to ensure the rule functions correctly in a wide, wide variety of Commander game situations, and that will take more development time.
