Day 2 Coverage



1,547 players gathered in Barcelona to test their mettle in Modern and to celebrate the 25th anniversary of *Magic: The Gathering*.


The Top 8 was filled with white-blue control players, including (9) Javier Dominguez who repeated his performance from Grand Prix Copenhagen three weeks earlier. But in the end it came down to two quick games between Louis Deltour's Krark-Clan Ironworks and Matti Kuisma's Dredge. Deltour earned his third finalist's trophy, while Kuisma dredged up enough resources to claim the crown.
