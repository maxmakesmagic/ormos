By now you probably seen a few pictures and the pairings and you know all the big Pro Tour names who showed up. But what about the local players? Latin America isn't exactly a powerhouse in **Magic**. You might know a couple of Pro Tour regulars, or the Latin players who qualified for the Invitational, but that is clearly not enough.

To help you out we have put together a small list of the top names in Latin America. Some of them might not be here today but that doesn't mean you shouldn't expect to see them in future events. 

Lets start with the list of past Brazilian Grand Prix winners and finalists:

**Curitiba 2002:** Guilherme Dei Svaldi defeated Alex Shvartsman.  
**Rio 2001:** Carlos Romao defeated Alex Shvartsman.  
**Sao Paulo 2000:** Rafael Alvarenga defeated Douglas Maioli.  
**Rio 1998:** Jon Finkel defeated Steve O'Mahoney-Schwartz.

It seems we are in the middle of a trend: after losing the first Grand Prix to the amazing Jon Finkel Brazilians have taken control of their home turf. Curiously the trend seems to have created another trend: Alex Shvartsman losing in the finals.

But Latin America isn't just Brazil, so here are the rest of the Latin Grand Prix so far:

**Santiago 2001:** Matias Gabrenja defeated Gerardo Godinez.  
**Buenos Aires 2000:** Hugo Araiza defeated Walter Witt.

For the last two years Grand Prix played second fiddle to the biggest continental tournament around here. That's right Latin Championship. Here are the top 8 for the championships held before the tournament was retired from the circuit:

### 2001

1) Scott Richards  
 2) Diego Ostrovich  
 3) Raphael Garcia  
 4) Victor Galimbertti  
 5) Christian Pereira  
 6) Eduardo Sella  
 7) Alejandro del Gerbo Actis  
 8) Julio Silva Maciel

### 2000

1) Gustavo Chapela Gaxiola  
 2) Rafael Le Saux  
 3) Gerardo Godinez-Estrada  
 4) Carlos E Romao  
 5) Francisco Garcia Barbosa  
 6) Alex Sousa  
 7) Eduardo Simao Teixeira  
 8) Thomas E Felsberg

To finish the lists, the Top 40 Constructed - since this is a Standard tournament - players in the continent:

We hope this helps you through the weekend. At least when you check the final standings you will have an easier time figuring out if someone came out of the blue to finish in the Top 8 or if they have been around for a while.
