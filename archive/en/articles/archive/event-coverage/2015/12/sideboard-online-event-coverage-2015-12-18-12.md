**U.S. Nationals 1999 Reports**

Round 4 Feature Match
---------------------



**Dave Humpherys vs. Brian Hacker** 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/USNAT99/images/R3FeatureHacker.JPG)In 
 another triumph for Your Moves Games, Dave Humpherys laid upon DKLA's 
 Brian Hacker one of the more severe beatings he's taken in some 
 time. Hacker's three-Rancor deck seemed strong coming out of the 
 draft, but it proved to be no match for Humpherys' B/W Monstrocity. 
 


Game 1 started with Hacker mulliganing to six cards. Humpherys 
 dropped a Phyrexian Denouncer on turn two which essentially crippled 
 Hacker's entire offensive core, which consists of many 1 toughness 
 creatures. Hacker's hand was weak enough that he was forced to drop 
 a land on turn four and say 'go'. 


Dave's mobile Fort started beating down as Brian had no creatures 
 to block, and Brian quickly conceded when the score stood 14-1. 
 As dave cut Brian's deck, Brian openly prayed for an opening hand 
 draw of Plague Beetles and three Rancors, and when he dropped a 
 first turn Beetles, the two shared a laugh. 


Unfortunately for Hacker, the second game didn't provide much for 
 him to smile about. After Dave dropped a Denouncer second turn, 
 he took total control of the board with Wall of Glare aqnd Mobile 
 Fort. When Brian finally dealt with Dave's 4/4 Phyrexian Broodling 
 and dropped his hand, Dave calmly Pariahed Brian's 5/2 Skittering 
 Skirge, and when Pestilence hit the table, Brian scooped. 


Humpherys is now 4-0 and goes on to meet either Ron Schubert, Mike 
 Turian or the winner of the Mike Flores/Jamie Parke match.
