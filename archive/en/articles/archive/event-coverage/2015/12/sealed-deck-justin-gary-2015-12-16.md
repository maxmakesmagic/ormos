Justin Gary didn't really have a Sealed Deck strategy going into Grand Prix Helsinki. "The only Invasion Sealed Deck I have opened was in Manchester, so developing a coherent strategy was kind of difficult. Though I know that blue, black and red are the strongest colours, so those were the colours I looked into first," Justin says.



The 20-year old Your Move Games team member didn't exactly get the deck of his choice. "I opened up my cards and realised there was nothing spectacular. I had a couple of good removal spells, but other than that it was just solid creatures. There were two Faerie Squadrons in blue, a couple of good Kavus in red, two Pincer Spiders in green - and a couple of good gold cards like Blazing Specter and Reckless Assault. It was pretty open, no colour jumped out and said that I had to play it," Justin explains.



This is the card pool he opened:

"I had a lot of playable cards, but few good cards. Black had the best removal spells, an Exotic Curse, an Agonizing Demise and an Annhilate. Red had the best creatures. There was no other really good removal, I had two Shackles but no tap guys," Justin says.



This is the deck he ended up playing:



6 Mountain
  
3 Plains
  
7 Swamp
  
1 Geothermal Crevice
  
1 Darigaaz's Attendant
  
1 Treva's Attendant
  
1 Blazing Specter
  
1 Reckless Assault
  
1 Ruham Djinn
  
2 Shackles
  
1 Agonizing Demise
  
1 Annihilate
  
1 Duskwalker
  
1 Exotic Curse
  
1 Phyrexian Battleflies
  
1 Phyrexian Reaper
  
1 Recover
  
1 Scavenged Weaponry
  
1 Ancient Kavu
  
2 Hooded Kavu
  
1 Kavu Runner
  
1 Loafing Giant
  
1 Rage Weaver
  
1 Tribal Flames
  
1 Viashino Grappler




"I ended up going with black and red, and I added two Attendants but I was still short on cards. So I splashed white for two Shackles and one Djinn. I play three white cards and three plains. The deck has good black removal and a lot of solid creatures, but unfortunately nothing broken. The deck was hard to make, and the hardest choice was probably to decide what the splash colour was going to be. Green was easier to splash for, but I'd be splashing for random creatures. So white was the only colour I could legitimately splash."



In general, Justin figured that his deck was pretty mediocre. "I have the potential to win with it, but I've seen many better decks. 2-1-1 would probably be ideal for me, though I'm obviously hoping for more," he says, the Top 8 performance from Grand Prix Manchester fresh in his memory.
