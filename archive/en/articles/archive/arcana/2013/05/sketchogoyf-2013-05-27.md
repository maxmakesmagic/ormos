 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 







You already know about a few cards from *Modern Masters*, and as this week proceeds you will learn even more (so keep checking the [Card Image Gallery](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/modernmasters/cig#)). [The first card revealed](/en/node/647341) for the set came as the large and moving [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), originally printed in *Future Sight*. And hey, look, it has new art!

So let's take a look at the process behind getting that cool new art ready for the card. First, there was the always-handy art order:



> 
>  Color: Green creature  
>  Location: Ancient coniferous forest, touches of snow  
>  Action: We see a huge pile of debris atop a hill in the forestâ€”rich loam, broken and rusted armor pieces, and countless bones amid the black dirt. From the debris heap bursts a massive monster that feeds on death. It's yours to design, but it should have a grey-brown hide maybe mottled with green or beige, an enormous set of jaws, and huge hands that can scoop up chunks of food, living or dead.  
>  Focus: The ancient and terrible creature  
>  Mood: A devouring monstrosity 
> 
> 
> 


 Artist [Ryan Barger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Ryan+Barger%22%5D) then took that description and provided a sketch:

After approval, Ryan filled out the sketch into the final version we see on the card today:
