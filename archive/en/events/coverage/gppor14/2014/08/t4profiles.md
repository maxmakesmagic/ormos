Three Pro Tour Top 8s, six Pro Tour Top 16s, six Team Grand Prix Top 4s.


**What colors was your first Sealed deck, what was your record with it, and what was your best card?**  

I went 8-1 with mono-white. [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) was the best card.


**What colors was your second Sealed deck, what was your record with it, and what was your best card?**  

I went 4-0 (the team went 5-0), and [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) was the best card.


**What would winning the Grand Prix mean to you?**  

It would mean a lead in the Player of the Year race but missing my flight.

**Age:** 29  
**Hometown:** Las Angeles, CA

**What colors was your second Sealed deck, what was your record with it, and what was your best card?**  

I played black-red and went 2-2 (team went 5-0). My teammates are great... seriously. [Scuttling Doom Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scuttling+Doom+Engine) is sweet and LSV and Efro did not lose a match today.


**What would winning the Grand Prix mean to you?**  

Everything. It is an absolutely amazing feeling being qualified for the Pro Tour again. I can't stress this enough, but I've been fortunate enough to be teamed with two all-time greats. I still can't believe that I'm qualified!

### Eric Severson


**Age:** 22  
**Hometown:** Berkeley, CA


 

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments**   

Day 2 Pro Tour *Theros*, two Grand Prix Top 64s


**What colors was your first Sealed deck, what was your record with it, and what was your best card?**  

Blue-black. Our team was 8-0-1 and the combo of [Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph)ist's Jest and [Festergloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festergloom) was good.


**What colors was your second Sealed deck, what was your record with it, and what was your best card?**  

White-blue. Our team was 3-2 and [Dauntless River Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+River+Marshal) was the best card.

It's a great start to the pro season and a big step toward my pro *Magic* dreams.





 

### Benjamin Weitz


**Age:** 24  
**Hometown:** St. Paul, MN


 

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments**   

I won a local "Standard for Power" tournament once, and I placed 13th at Grand Prix Oakland.


**What colors was your first Sealed deck, what was your record with it, and what was your best card?**  

Red-green. My team went 8-0-1 and my deck was good enough to not weight my teammates down too much. [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) was slightly better than [Kalonian Twingrove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalonian+Twingrove).


**What colors was your second Sealed deck, what was your record with it, and what was your best card?**  

Blue-green, and bad enough to weigh my teammates down significantly. We went 3-2 and [Siege Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Wurm) was my best card.


**What would winning the Grand Prix mean to you?**  

Winning the Grand Prix would be one of my life's greatest accomplishments. I've been playing *Magic* for a LONG time but haven't had much top-tier success. I love this game so much and I'm going to enjoy battling in Honolulu!







 

### Josiah Skallerup


**Age:** 32  
**Hometown:** Oakland, CA


 

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments**   

32nd place at Grand Prix Columbus in *Mirrodin* Limited.


**What colors was your first Sealed deck, what was your record with it, and what was your best card?**  

White-black. Our team went 8-0-1. My best cards were my two [Stab Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stab+Wound). Honorable mention goes to the two Heliod's Pilgrim I had to fetch them up. Bleeding my opponents out all day was incredibly satisfying.


**What colors was your second Sealed deck, what was your record with it, and what was your best card?**  

Black-red. Our team went 3-2. [Accursed Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accursed+Spirit) was my biggest workhorse, but a top-decked [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) (sometimes facilitated by [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess), sometimes not) was also rather good.


**What would winning the Grand Prix mean to you?**  

Winning the Grand Prix would mean so much to me, both by affirming the love I have for the game, and the bond I share with my teammates.

I went 5-4 with blue-black-red. [Ob Nixilis, Unshackled](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ob+Nixilis%2C+Unshackled) and [Indulgent Tormentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indulgent+Tormentor) were my best cards.


**What colors was your second Sealed deck, what was your record with it, and what was your best card?**  

I went 3-2 with black-red. [Xathrid Slyblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Slyblade) + [Burning Anger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Anger) = [Visara the Dreadful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful).

Better hardware for my cubicle.





 

### Ben Yu


**Age:** 28  
**Hometown:** Las Vegas, NV


 

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments**   

I finished in the Top 4 at Grand Prix Warsaw. I also forgot to play [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) and Turn 1 today and just passed the turn and won the game, obviously.


**What colors was your first Sealed deck, what was your record with it, and what was your best card?**  

I played Green-White Convoke. I used [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) for [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen), [Constricting Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Constricting+Sliver) when I had [Sliver Hive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Hive), or [Yisan, the Wanderer Bard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yisan%2C+the+Wanderer+Bard), which I then used to fetch the [Soulmender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulmender)/Ajani's Pridemate combo.


**What colors was your second Sealed deck, what was your record with it, and what was your best card?**  

I played mono-white with [Avacyn, Guardian Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%2C+Guardian+Angel) splashing green and blue.


**What would winning the Grand Prix mean to you?**  

I finished last year with 16 Pro Points and missed Silver. I wasn't qualified for Pro Tour Khans of Tarkir in Honolulu and I was going to stop going to Grand Prix and everything else. Now I'm going to go to everything again. ALOHA!

A lot more travel.
