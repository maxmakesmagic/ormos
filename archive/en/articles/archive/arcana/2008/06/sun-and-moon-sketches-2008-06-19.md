As we've occasionally mentioned, artists sometimes give us more than one sketch to choose from. For [Wheel of Sun and Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+of+Sun+and+Moon), Zoltan Boros and Gabor Szikszai outdid themselves. But let's start at the beginning.

The art description was purposely vague:


> This is an abstract piece. Show a circular design that interlaces braid and knot patterns with imagery of Shadowmoor elves, European animals, and astronomy (sun, moon and stars). It should resemble an ancient Celtic knot design. This card is about rebirth and the cycles of nature; symbolism should be about revolutions, orbits, seasons, and life/death, night/day duality.
