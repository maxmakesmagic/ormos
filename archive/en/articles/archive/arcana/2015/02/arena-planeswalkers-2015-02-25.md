Some of you may know what we're getting at already. Some of you may have even been among the lucky few to see early versions of, well, of this:

*Magic: The Gathering Arena of the Planeswalkers* is the *Magic: The Gathering* strategy board game we told you about [way back when](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/boardgame). It's a game where you play as one of Gideon, Jace, Liliana, Chandra, or Nissa, summoning armies and casting game-changing spells to outmaneuver your opponents. The goal is to be the last Planeswalker standing.



Created for two to five players, *Magic: The Gathering Arena of the Planeswalkers* is a standalone game set in the world of *Magic*, but with a whole different gaming experience for you to explore. The art, themes, and characters will all feel very familiar as you try to lead one of the Planeswalkers to victory.



*Magic: The Gathering Arena of the Planeswalkers* is scheduled for release in Summer 2015, and we'll be sure to keep you updated as we get closer to the release.
