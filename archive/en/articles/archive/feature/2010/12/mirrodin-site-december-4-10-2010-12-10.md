Welcome back to "On the Mirrodin Site," where we show off some of the recent highlights from the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/).

Do you like wallpapers? The Mirran side has [Kemba, Kha Regent](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#plains,hotspots;W11;0;) and the Phyrexians have [Bonehoard](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#swamps,hotspots;B5;0;), which is from a set that's not out yet!

How about concept art? You can see early designs for [sphinxes](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#islands,hotspots;U11;0;)! And if you just want to see preview art for an upcoming set, cast your eyes on [Koth's Courier](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#mountains,hotspots;R3;0;).
