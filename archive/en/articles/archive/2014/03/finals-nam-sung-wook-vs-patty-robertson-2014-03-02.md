Sung-Wook opened with a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), revealing a hand replete with goodies. Double [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), double [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) and [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) stared back at him. He took the [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere), and Robertson simply laid lands and kept passing.


Sung-Wook followed up with a [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter), forcing Robertson to blow one of his Verdicts to keep the troublesome flier at bay. Sung-Wook snuck some damage in with a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), having used a scry land to spot an upcoming [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize).


Robertson played an untapped [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain) to get to Jace mana, then immediately used his draw ability to nab a [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) and a land, edging him out of the danger zone. Sung-Wook finished off Jace with his [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and summoned another [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter).


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmel14/f_robertson.jpg)  

The [Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) attacked Robertson to 8, stealing an [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) from his library. A [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) met with a loooooong pause before Robertson revealed his hand, still with double Revelation, an therling, a [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) and a [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade). Sung-Wook took the [Ã†therling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling) and Robertson took the opportunity to cast a [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for 3, going back to 11 life and hunting for answers to the troublesome flier. With two of his best win conditions gone, Robertson was under pressure to come up with the goods.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thoughtseize)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)
Another attack from the [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) landed Sung-Wook a [Temple of Enlightenment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Enlightenment), meaning he was only a single white source off being able to cast his opponent's [Elspeth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion). Robertson fired off another [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) and finally used a [Last Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) to take out Sung-Wook's flier.


Robertson summoned a [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought), whose second ability provided a split of [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) vs. [Elspeth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion). After some thought, Robertson took the [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). Sung-Wook cast an [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections), and Robertson spent a [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) to keep it off the board. A second Connections resolved, however.


Robertson cast his [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and saw a hand of double [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) and a [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight), taking one of the Downfalls. Sung-Wook's [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) started sneaking in for some damage, the Korean player ignoring Jace and aiming to pressure Robertson into acting. Robertson fired off his third Revelation for 5. His first plan of action was a [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) on Sung-Wook's [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections): if there was any card drawin' to be bein' done, the U/W player was to be the one doin' it.


Sung-Wook kicked it up a notch with a [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon). A [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) took care of the troublesome little spice weasel and [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) cleared out Sung-Wook's second [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) before summoning an Elspeth. Sung-Wook cast a [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), sapping Robertson back down to 10 life, and had another [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) to try and find some answers to the dangerous Planeswalker.


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmel14/f_nam.jpg)  

Robertson summoned another [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) and went digging with it. Sung-Wook went to [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) one of the Soldier tokens, but Robertson offed it with a [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) to keep his army ticking over. Sung-Wook had a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), giving him an option of Robertson's final [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), a [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate), [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) or a [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve). Holding two Gray Merchants of Asphodel in hand and with his opponent on 10 life, he took the Revelation.


Sung-Wook attacked with his Gray Merchant, who got gang-blocked by a pile of Soldier tokens. Returning the attack, Robertson swung with all his Soldier tokens and a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), keen to push his offence. Sung-Wook ate a Soldier with his [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and took the rest, falling to 10. Another attack, and Robertson took the epic first game and sent both players to their sideboards.


Patty Robertson 1 - Nam Sung-Wook 0A [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) from Sung-Wook revealed Jace, Elspeth, and four lands, Sung-Wook taking the Jace. Robertson played (obviously) lands for a few turns, while Sung-Wook summoned a [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) and began attacking with it.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead)
Sung-Wook followed up with an [Erebos, God of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead). Robertson had a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), while Sung-Wook used [Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead)'s [Greed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greed) ability to dig for more threats. While Sung-Wook was tapped out, Robertson fired off a [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for 2.


Robertson cast an [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion), which Sung-Wook countered with a [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) from his [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter). Sung-Wook then summoned a [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) and attacked with his Specter and [Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead). Robertson had a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), knocking himself to 5 life before casting a [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) to clear out the [Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) and Demon.


A [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) took Robertson's [Fated Retribution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Retribution) and another [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) made an appearance. With his hand stripped and his life total dropping, Robertson scooped up his cards and headed for the decider.


Nam Sung-Wook 1 - Patty Robertson 1Sung-Wook's opening [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) saw a pair of Jace's and a [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere), the latter heading straight to the graveyard. Robertson cast some discard of his own, his [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) seeing [Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead), [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter), [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) and triple [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault). He took the Zombie, but Sung-Wook drew and summoned another. Robertson cast one of his Jace's and started creeping his loyalty count upwards.


Sung-Wook attacked the Jace with his Zombie, then summoned an [Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead). Robertson dug furiously with his Jace and scored a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and a Plains. Sung-Wook summoned another [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie), revealing a [Last Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) and Robertson's remaining Jace. With the fresh information, Sung-Wook attacked Robertson with his [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and [Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead) and went to take out Jace with one of his Zombies.


Robertson cast a [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) in the nick of time to take out both of Sung-Wook's Zombies and de-activate [Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead), buying himself some valuable breathing time. Sung-Wook attacked with both of his [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s and Robertson threw one of his own in as a blocker, happy to trade lands for life and time.


Robertson summoned his second [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought), then took a [Revoke Existence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revoke+Existence) over a [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) and a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), then exiled Sung-Wook's [Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead). A [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) revealed Robertson holding a pair of lands, leading Sung-Wook's [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s to take out the Planeswalker in short order. [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) joined the battlefield, the [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s cracked in, Robertson scooped up his cards, and just like that, the tournament was over.


Congratulations to Nam Sung-Wook, your Grand Prix: Melbourne champion!
