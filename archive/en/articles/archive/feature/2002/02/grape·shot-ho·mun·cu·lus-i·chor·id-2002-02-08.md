**grape·shot**

![Grapeshot Catapult](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grapeshot+Catapult)  

From Merriam-Webster Online:  

Function: noun  

Date: 1747  

1 : an antipersonnel weapon consisting of a cluster of small iron balls shot from a cannon**ho·mun·cu·lus**

![Sneaky Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sneaky+Homunculus)  

From Merriam-Webster Online:  

Function: noun  

Inflected Form(s): plural **ho·mun·cu·li**  

Etymology: Latin, diminutive of *homin-*, *homo* human being  

Date: 1656  

1 : a little man : manikin  

2 : a miniature adult that in the theory of preformation is held to inhabit the germ cell and to produce a mature individual merely by an increase in size**I·chor·id**

![Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ichorid)  

From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  

Function: noun  

Etymology: Can't figure out how to pronounce this name? It'll help if you know the root word, *ichor*, which means "a watery, acrid discharge from a wound or ulcer." Since this horrific creature feeds on the recently dead, it would feed on ichor, therefore its name.
