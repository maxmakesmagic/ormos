Let's talk about *Commander's Arsenal*. We announced it at San Diego Comic-Con but didn't really say much about it. The success of our Commander decks has made us realize that we want to do them every year. So starting next year you can begin looking forward to annual Commander decks, until then you get a treasure trove of Commander cards and accessories! This will be a limited print run product, meant for the collectors and the avid Commander players.
