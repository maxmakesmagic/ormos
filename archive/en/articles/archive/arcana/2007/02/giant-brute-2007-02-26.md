*Planar Chaos's* timeshifted card [Brute Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brute+Force) poses the question, "What if red had temporary creature enhancement?" Like all the set's timeshifted cards, it takes some squinting to see [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) as a red effect, but it's not so far off given cards like [Enrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enrage), [Fists of the Anvil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fists+of+the+Anvil), [Barreling Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barreling+Attack), [Chaotic Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaotic+Strike) -- or just plain [Firebreathing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebreathing). The fact that [Brute Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brute+Force) grants a significant amount of *toughness* is odd for red, but that's where the squinting comes in.

You may have thought the art of [Brute Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brute+Force) was of a giant expressing his rage, spiked-club style, on the towers of a castle. He is a giant-sized brute, but that's actually just the effect of the spell.

*Brute Force art by Wayne Reynolds*

The figure in Wayne Reynolds's art is actually a Keldon, a member of a grey-skinned race of savage Dominarian warriors. Keldons are technically human; this guy was originally closer to the size of the unfortunates he's knocking clean out of their protective tower. But their *rage*... well, let's just say the warrior in the picture didn't need his *temper* to get +3/+3.

You can see other Keldons depicted in the *Time Spiral* Block on cards like [Keldon Halberdier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Halberdier), [Keldon Marauders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders), [Radha, Heir to Keld](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radha%2C+Heir+to+Keld) (she's half-Keldon), and on a *Future Sight* card.
