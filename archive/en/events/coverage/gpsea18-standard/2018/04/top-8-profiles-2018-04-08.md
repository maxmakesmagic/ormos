**Name:** Andrew Shain


**Hometown:** Norcross, GA


**Occupation:** middle school math teacher


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Top 8-ed a PPTQ at Da Planet


**What deck are you playing and why?**


Mardu Vehicles, because I like to go fast. Its aggressive nature and mana sinks make it hard for a deck to ever turn the corner.


**What was your best card this weekend and why?**


[Rekindling Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rekindling+Phoenix). It was traded to me by one of my students and its recursive ability and evasion proved to be game changing.


**What do you enjoy most about Standard?**


It is very inexpensive and I can play it with my students.


**What would winning the Grand Prix mean to you?**


Honestly, I'm just glad I did better than 0-2 drop.
