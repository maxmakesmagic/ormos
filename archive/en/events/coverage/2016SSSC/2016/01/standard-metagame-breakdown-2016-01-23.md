58 players showed up with seventeen different archetypes, but a few distinct decks were clear winners in terms of popularity.

The clear winner, despite the introduction of [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet), was 4-Color Rally with nearly a quarter of the field choosing the powerful [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors)/[Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) concoction, either streamlined without *Oath of the Gatewatch* cards or with the inclusion of a copy or three of [Ayli, Eternal Pilgrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ayli%2C+Eternal+Pilgrim) and the occasional [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage). Shortly behind Rally was Abzan Aggro, all unsurprisingly packing copies of [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost).


Next on the list is Eldrazi Aggro, all with variant numbers of cards. How many [Kozilek's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return)s are right? What about [Ruin in Their Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+in+Their+Wake)? Do you play it and accept a reasonable number of [Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wastes), or ignore it entirely and go harder into red instead? There have been variations, though [Ruin in Their Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+in+Their+Wake) was a popular enough inclusion thanks to the allure of some new colorless creatures (like [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer), which are quite good on the third turn). Decks were divided between whether to run [Kozilek, the Great Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+the+Great+Distortion), but nearly everyone was in agreement that [World Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker) was the seven-mana devoid creature of choice, thanks in part to any ramp deck with red choosing to play [Kozilek's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return).


The new anti-Rally legendary creature Kalitas has made its way into various decks, all looking to buy some time against the powerful combo deck.


One of the interesting developments in this Standard are the Dark Jeskai decks, which are nearing the point of needing a name change. Many have given up on [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider)s, instead moving towards a heavier Grixis package with the white splash for [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master) and [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom). Nearly all of these have quickly adopted [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers) into their strategy, which is of little surprise given its power with spells like [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) and [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom).
