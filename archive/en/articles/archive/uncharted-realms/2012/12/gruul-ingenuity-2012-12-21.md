Hi there,

*I'm Adam Lee. For those of you who don't know me, I am part of the **Magic** creative team, the Izzet-like machine that works tirelessly to bring you worlds like* New Phyrexia*,* Innistrad*, and*Ravnica*. I say Izzet-like because, at any minute, one of our heads might explode with the glee of creation.*

 I'll be taking over this column for Jenna and I hope to bring a little bit of the fun, intrigue, and insight of the **Magic** story that she brought to it. 

 Every now and then I also plan on pulling back the curtain on what goes on in the worldbuilding process here and how we come up with some of the stuff that eventually becomes part of the **Magic** story. For the most part, though, I will be telling you in-world tales that shine a spotlight on a little-known section of the myriad planes we create. 

Hope you enjoy and thanks for reading!
