Okay, we'll admit, watching the [Modern Pro Tour](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptrix) on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) got us a bit excited for *Masters 25*. Modern covers everything since *Eighth Edition*, but *Masters 25* covers all of *Magic*'s 25 years, with at least one card from each of our major releases in those 25 years.


We got a little nostalgic. The [25th Anniversary timeline](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magics-25th-anniversary-25-year-timeline) certainly helped push us in that direction.


So let's all get a little nostalgic together and show off the packaging for *Masters 25*:

That's new art with the spikey metal guy, but you might recognize the other two. There's no point in being coyâ€”*Masters 25* will feature the return of [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) and [Azusa, Lost but Seeking](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azusa%2C+Lost+but+Seeking):

Note the really cool watermark in Azusa's text box representing the original printing. Nearly every card in *Masters 25* will have this treatment, even cards originally printed in *Limited Edition (Alpha)*, *Beta*, and *Unlimited*!


*Masters 25* releases March 16, and full previews will start February 26!
