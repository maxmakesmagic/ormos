You liked it so much last year, **Magic: The Gathering** is returning to San Diego Comic Con in panel form!


On Friday, July 22, you can see, live and in person, such **Magic** luminaries as Aaron Forsythe and Mark Rosewater talk about the state of the game.



>  5:30 - 6:30: **Magic: The Gathering** Panel – On the heels of **Magic**'s most successful year in its 18-year history, some of the game's top creators share details on upcoming products as well as answer your questions. The panel, moderated by Mark Rosewater (head **Magic** designer), includes Aaron Forsythe (director, **Magic** R&D), Matt Cavotta (senior creative **Magic** art director), Mark Purvis (**Magic** senior brand manager), and Scott Larabee (**Magic** organized play program manager). **Room 32AB**

Last year this panel revealed early preview information on *Scars of Mirrodin*, so you can only imagine what might be on display this time around. Or if you go to the panel, you don't have to imagine at all!
