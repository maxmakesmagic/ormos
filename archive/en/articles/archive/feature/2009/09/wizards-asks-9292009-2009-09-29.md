*What's your favorite Constructed deck of all time?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_miketurian.jpg)**Mike Turian:** Pick just one! What a difficult question! Should I pick Angry Hermit? Slugageddon? The Car Deck? Green-White Maro? Squirrel-Opposition? They all have a special place in my heart, but I will pick [Red-Green Madness](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2008-12-06-0). I loved the feel of drawing from the Red-Green Madness deck. 

I played hundreds of games with the deck. [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd), [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption), and [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) gave the deck explosive starts.

Starting with a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) in your hand would unlock the sheer power of the deck. I loved the deck so much that when a reporter asked to take a picture of me with an opening hand, I took the green-red deck and constructed the perfect hand. Even though you could only see the backs of the cards in the photograph, I will always know how amazing that draw was.
