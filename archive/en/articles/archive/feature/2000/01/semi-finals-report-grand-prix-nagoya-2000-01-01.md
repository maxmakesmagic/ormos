**Bob Maher vs. Tadayoshi Komiya**  

Bob played blue/green and Tadayoshi Komiya played blue/black.


**Game 1**


Bob played Cloudskate and on the next turn Tadayoshi played Maggot Therapy. In response to Maggot Therapy, Bob played Tiger Claws to increase the toughness, this made a 5/1 flying trample creature. Tadayoshi was brought down to 10 life before fade counters killed the Cloudskate.


Tadayoshi played a Stronghold Machinist which prevented Bob from playing non-creature spells. Tadayoshi also played Skulking Fugitive and he also played Seal Removal to take out Bob's creatures and bring his life to 0.


Bob: 0  

Tadayoshi: 1


**Game 2**


Bob played a Skyshroud Ridgeback his opponent played a Cloudstrike, Rootwater Commando and a Stronghold Biologist. Bob played a Drake Hatchling and Rushwood Herbalist and Saprazzan Outrigger. Tadayoshi played a Puffer Extract and a Jolting Merfolk. Bob turned to his teammates and told them they had to win, because he would lose. Bob then attacked with the Drake Hatchling, his opponent did not block and Bob played Invigorate to win the game.


Bob: 1  

Tadayoshi: 1


**Game 3**


Bob played Rishadan Airship and Rushwood Herbalist. Tadayoshi played Stronghold Machinist and Cloudskate. Bob attacks with the Rushwood Herbalist, Tadoyashi blocks with the Stronghold Machinist. The Machinist went to the Graveyard and allowed Bob to play Spells at will. Bob plays a Drake Hatchling, Rishadan Brigade and Rootwater Commando, opponent has a Stinging Barrier, Rishadan Footpad and a Balloon Peddler in play.


Bob played Rising Water to keep Tadayoshi's lands tapped. Then Bob used his Flying and Islandwalking creatures to bring Tadayoshi's life to 0.


Final Score:  

Bob: 2  

Tadayoshi:1


**Michael Long vs. Jun Nobushita**  

Michael played white/red and Jun played white/green.


**Game 1**


Michael played Voice of Truth, which should prove to be strong against the Rebel Deck that Jun played. Jun played Alabaster Wall with several Rebels. The Rebels with the aid of the Deepwood Drummer performed the beatdown.


Michael: 0  

Jun:1


**Game 2**


Jun began with a Thermal Glider and a Snarling Gahr. Michael played a Charm Peddler, Flowstone Crusher and a Flowstone Wall to prevent Rebel beatdown. Jun played two Alabaster Walls and Jovall Queen. Both players played numerous creatures. Michael attempted an all out attack, but was unsuccessful due to the Walls and the Defender en-Vec preventing all the damage. As Michael's creatures were now all tapped, Jun was free to attack him and defeat him.


Michael: 0  

Jun: 2


**David Williams vs. Matsuo Goro**  

David played black/green and Matsuo played black/red.


**Game 1**


David started out with a Horned Troll and Seal of Strength. Matsuo defeated the Horned Troll by attacking with the Flowstone Crusher and Shocktroops. David played Bargaining Table which did not help him. Matsuo killed him on the next turn.


David: 0  

Matsuo: 1


**Game 2**


David drew four Swamps and three Green cards. Unfortunately for David, he never drew a Forest. The game was decided very quickly.


David: 0  

Matsuo: 2


**Result of Match:**


Godzilla loses and is 3rd place at GP Nagoya.  

Masato Club wins and advances to the finals against Team New Wave.
