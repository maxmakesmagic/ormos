Welcome back! I hope you enjoyed our trip through the Best of 2015 over these past two weeks, even though I know you were probably jonesing for some more *Oath of the Gatewatch* information after the goodies we showed off at the World *Magic* Cup.


And now that we're back, it's time for previews to start in earnest, including the packaging for the set. Let's get to it.


First up are the booster packs, featuring some familiar-looking Planeswalkers doing something that looks like the Pledge of Allegiance (for our non-American audience out there, imagine Gideon in grade school chanting at the American flag). They look a little like this:

Those boosters can all be picked up in booster boxes that look a little like this. It's Nissa's home plane, so it makes sense she gets top billing.

And, of course, we have the Fat Pack as well, with more Nissa in the foreground and our Planeswalker troupe in the background.

Next up are the Intro Packs. Three of the cards can be seen in Matt Tabak's [mechanics article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/oath-gatewatch-mechanics-2015-12-28) today, and the rest you can see below!

Here's a closer look at the other two.

You can get all of these together when *Oath of the Gatewatch* releases on January 22 at a store near you!
