Night is sweeping across the land. Ominous howls and cruel cackles fill the long shadows, and it is well past time for good folk to bar the door and pray for sunrise. But for those bold enough to venture out into the dark, there's adventure and glory to be had. If you choose to face the night head-on, you'll win eternal night card styles from *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* representing some of the foes you've faced. You'll get new card styles each time until you've collected the whole set.

Whenever day becomes night, you draw a card and you lose 1 life."
