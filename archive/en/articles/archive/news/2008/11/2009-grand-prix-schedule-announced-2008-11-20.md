![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/grandprix/images/NEW_GP.jpg)Wizards of the Coast is proud to announce the complete 2009 Grand Prix schedule. With Grand Prix held in major cities in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, Brazil, Thailand, and Singapore, your shot at a piece of the $30,000 prize pool and a Pro Tour invitation is as close as ever.


Starting January 17-18 in Los Angeles and running through November 14-15 in Minneapolis, the 2009 season features 19 Grand Prix on 19 separate weekends. That's right, no more overlapping weekends…that means it's possible to attend every Grand Prix next season! Formats include Extended, Standard, Legacy, and Sealed Deck with Booster Draft.


The other major change for next year involves the cut to Day 2. Starting in 2009, if you go X-2 on Day 1, you've earned a spot on Day 2. That means no more worrying about missing the cut due to low tiebreakers…just avoid that third loss and your Sunday ticket will be punched. 


* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players—whichever is greater—advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players—whichever is greater—advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
