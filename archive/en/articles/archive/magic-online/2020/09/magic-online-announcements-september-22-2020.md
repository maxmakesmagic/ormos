Banned & Restricted List Update Window
--------------------------------------


On Monday, September 28, R&D will make an announcement regarding the banned and restricted list. *Magic Online* will implement the change on the same day at noon, September 28, at 12 p.m. PT.


When a card is banned or restricted, players using newly banned cards in leagues have until the *Magic Online* effective time to finish those league courses. At that time, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned or unrestricted, players can join existing leagues with decks containing those cards after the update.

* Copies of permanent spells will now properly trigger "when this becomes the target of a spell" abilities.
* Blue text has been added to Kabira Takedown to indicate the number of creatures controlled by the spell's controller. This will be, in most cases, the amount of damage dealt on resolution.
