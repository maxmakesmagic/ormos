Here are the Top 5 cards of Grand Prix Sydney 2014.

### 5. [Forge Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forge+Devil)


Over the weekend people caught on to the number of x/1 creatures in *Magic 2015* and the value of [Forge Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forge+Devil) rose and rose. That single damage takes down 25 creatures in *M15*, and in a tempo-based format like this, killing a Turn 1 [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) or Turn 2 [Generator Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Generator+Servant) could be vital. In a format with convoke [Forge Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forge+Devil) also had added utility, allowing early access to big effects.

### 4. [Covenant of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covenant+of+Blood)


The seven mana sorcery proved its worth time and time again this weekend, killing any number of War-Forged Golem, [Master of Predicaments](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Predicaments) and [Charging Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charging+Rhino). The four life was vital to keeping black mages alive while they stablised and took control of the game, and the ability to convoke early made the card more efficient than it first appeared. More than one game was closed out by a Covenant to the face, demonstrating a flexibility that helped push it into the number 4 spot.

### 3. [Siege Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Wurm)


The marquee green common, [Siege Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Wurm) was the sledgehammer that threatened to make an appearance as early as Turn 3. With so few creatures able to profitably block it, and most removal unable to kill it, [Siege Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Wurm) showed up in multiples in some of the best decks all day, and each of the green Top 8 decks featured a [Siege Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Wurm). Sometimes if you can't block your opponent's spirit tokens, it works to just run right over the top of them.

### 2. [Coral Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Barrier)


Almost every blue deck we saw this weekend was running [Coral Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Barrier) and boy did it do some work. It could profitably block most of the X/1 creatures in the format, and the token did good work against opposing Islands. Not to mention how well it worked fueling Covenants of [Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood) and [Siege Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Wurm)s and [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits).

### 1. [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm)


Move over Neale, I'm writing this one. Ok, I'd just like to tell you all about my second favorite card in *Magic 2015* (behind [Heat Ray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heat+Ray), obviously). This tricky little spell was all over our Top 8 this evening. Maitland Cameron was packing a handful, and our Grand Prix champion Paul Jackson had a couple too. This innocuous little common has been creeping up people's pick orders of late, as everyone has figured out just how good they are with [Selfless Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Cathar)s, [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits), and well, pretty much everything with convoke on it. I love this spell, and I'm thrilled they've reprinted this over something truly distasteful like [Raise Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+Dead).
