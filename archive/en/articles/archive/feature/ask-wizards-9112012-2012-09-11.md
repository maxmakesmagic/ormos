Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks! 

**Q:** How do I play with these new cards? My friend just taught me the game I and want to get them as soon as possible so I can beat him.

Howdy Tomas!


Well, your first chance to play with all of these cards is going to be the *Return to Ravnica* Prerelease, coming up on September 29 and 30. You can find stores near you by visiting the [store locator](http://locator.wizards.com) and entering your address. The site will show you the nearest WPN stores and what events they have scheduled to run!


We'll also have an article in two weeks that is our "Prerelease Primer," which will give you a great overview on what to expect with a Prerelease and with the new set.


Good luck and have fun!


  
**Q:** Why aren't there previews on the weekends?

Previews are an interesting beast in terms of scheduling. To answer your question, let me first clarify how they're done. A group inside Wizards determines the preview plan for a set, we figure out what cards to show, and who gets them. I lead that team.


For sites other than **DailyMTG.com**, we tell them when they can preview their cards. They have a 24-hour window before it goes up on the [Card Image Gallery](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/returntoravnica/cig) on MagicTheGathering.com.


We tend to keep previews on a Monday-through-Friday schedule, with some exceptions, because that's when **Magic** traffic is the highest. Players are either playing in events or doing other things over the weekends, so updates on Saturday and Sunday tend to reach a lower number of people.


Will we do more previews on weekends? Maybe. You'll have to wait and see!


Good luck and have fun!
