Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com).

 **Q: Which maze runner finished the Implicit Maze in first? And what is the reward for finishing the maze?  

â€”Matthias**  


Well, Matthias, you're in luck, because we know just who to ask about this: longtime **Magic** creative team member, [Doug Beyer](http://www.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Doug%20Beyer)! Doug wrote *The Secretist*, the official story of what is happening on Ravnica, including the Implicit Maze.


According to Doug: "Roughly speaking, Part One sets up what's brewing about the maze, Part Two raises the stakes for Ravnica, and Part Three is how it all shakes out."


We'll have more information about *The Secretist* on DailyMTG tomorrow, including when Part Three releases, so make sure to come back for that!
