Three hundred fifty-two players sat down Day 1 of the 2010 World Championships in Chiba, Japan. Standard was the first of three Constructed formats to be played during the four-day festival. How would the metagame look with the season winding down?

Valakut Ramp led the charge with 114 players. Fueled by green mana acceleration spells like [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow), [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) and [Khalni Heart Expedition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Heart+Expedition), this deck finished its opponents with [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) and its namesake card [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle).


The next two most-played decks were both control decks. Blue-White Control and Blue-Black Control had 59 and 51 players, respectively. Each used blue for countermagic and [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). The choice of pairing this with white versus black was made purely on the removal package. [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) and [Journey to Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) were the common choices in white while [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) and [Consume the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek) played similar roles in black.


We saw the first creature-based aggro deck come in at fourth place with Vampires. [Bloodthrone Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire) and [Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer) made the leap from the Limited environment as they were recorded on 28 of the players' 60-card decklists. The synergies of these sacrifice outlets paired with [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) and [Kalastria Highborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn) created the potential of ending games in a hurry. Most players splashed red for removal while a small number decided on a mono-black design.


Rounding out the top five archetypes was Red-Blue-Green Control. Commonly referred to as RUG, 22 players crammed together all the best cards in Standard into one very powerful package. [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) and [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) provided the card advantage, [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) accelerated its mana base, and your choice of [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan) or [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) were used as finishers.


These were only the top five archetypes here in Chiba. Five more archetypes accounted for upward of five percent of the field each, including [Quest for the Holy Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quest+for+the+Holy+Relic), Boros , [Genesis Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Wave), Red Deck Wins and Mono-green Ramp. Eight more archetypes made up over 19 rogue lists. Which of these decks would help carry its pilot to a birth on Sunday? Find out in the days to come.
