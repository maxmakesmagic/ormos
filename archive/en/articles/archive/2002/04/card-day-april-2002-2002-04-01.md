**Card of the Day - mardi 30 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Barbarian%20Outcast)#### Barbarian Outcast


*Torment* common.  
In the lower right-hand corner of the picture is a small earthenware bowl featuring a mask of Yawgmoth. This isn't supposed to be there -- the invasion is over, Yawgmoth is dead, and the Phyrexians ignored Otaria. Pretty mysterious.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 29 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fishliver%20Oil)#### Fishliver Oil


*Arabian Nights* common.  
Like many *Arabian Nights* commons, there are two versions of Fishliver Oil with the mana costs in different sized circles. Some collectors don't consider themselves to have a full set unless they have both versions of each card.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 26 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jackal%20Pup)#### Jackal Pup


*Tempest* uncommon.  
This card, originally called Jackal Familiar, got an illustration that is somewhat... passive: a little girl apparently about to feed her puppy. Needless to say, the *Tempest* team was a little disappointed with the art, and used the flavor text to poke fun at it. To make matters worse, Jackal Pup turned out to be one of the most aggressive cards in **Magic**'s history.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 25 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Terror)#### Terror

 Alpha common.  
The art for this card was submitted with the dimensions reversed. Jesper Myrfors, the art director for Alpha, just turned the art sideways. He thought it looked cool and kept it that way.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 24 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Auratog)#### Auratog


*Tempest* rare.  
When the illustration for Auratog came in, former **Magic** graphic designer Daniel Gelon noticed that it bears some resemblance to the old "Keep On Truckin'" graphic from the 70's. Daniel thought it was so funny that he made posters of the illustration with the caption, "Keep On Toggin'."
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 23 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Leviathan)#### Leviathan


*The Dark* rare.  
Leviathan was the first creature to have double-digit power and/or toughness. The closest up to that point was the 9/9 Colossus of Sardia.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 22 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kamahl,%20Pit%20Fighter)#### Kamahl, Pit Fighter


*Odyssey* rare.  
Kamahl is the first creature to have both haste and a tap ability.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 19 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hero's%20Resolve)#### Hero's Resolve


*Tempest* common.  
This enchant creature was given the nickname "Fat Pants" by Pro Tour players. Now "pants" is slang for creature enchantments in general.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 18 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Krovikan%20Fetish)#### Krovikan Fetish


*Ice Age* common.  
The Fetish was the first "cantrip" creature enchantment -- meaning you got to draw a card after you cast it.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 17 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vanishing)#### Vanishing


*Visions* common.  
Phasing triggers "leaves play effects" but not "comes into play effects." Why? Because the rules say so. So Vanishing combos in weird ways with Laquatus's Champion, Soul Scourge, and a blue *Judgment* creature.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 16 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Unholy%20Strength)#### Unholy Strength

 Alpha common.  
The original version had a pentagram in the background, but the continuity department decided to remove all real-world religious symbolism from card art prior to *Fourth Edition*. Fourth Edition versions of this card art have plain yellow backgrounds.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 15 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=White%20Ward)#### White Ward

 Alpha uncommon.  
Using its original wording (which survived through *Revised*), White Ward would be destroyed by its own effect when it resolved. This wasn't really the case, however, as rules for protection in the days of Alpha weren't the same as they are now.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 12 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Equilibrium)#### Equilibrium


*Exodus* rare.  
Jeff Miracola's illustration for this card marks the inspiration for (and the first appearance of) the loved and hated Beebles. These little creatures were later added to the *Urza* block as by-products of Tolarian time experiments.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 11 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lord%20of%20Tresserhorn)#### Lord of Tresserhorn


*Alliances* rare.  
The Lord's stats were changed from 9/4 to 10/4 in development, just so the playtesters could give him the nickname "Good Buddy," as in "10-4, good buddy!"
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 10 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Formation)#### Formation


*Ice Age* rare.  
This card was originally called "Tactics," but when the art came back featuring running ostriches, "Tactics" didn't seem to fit very well.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 9 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Squirrel%20Nest)#### Squirrel Nest


*Odyssey* uncommon.  
The *Odyssey* enchant lands were designed as gold cards. Squirrel Nest was blue/white and tapped to produce 1/1 flying spirit tokens. They were all shifted to mono-colored during development.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 8 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Relic%20Bind)#### Relic Bind


*Legends* uncommon.  
The original wording of Relic Bind allowed it to be cast on your own artifacts, creating a two-card instant win with Basalt Monolith. Oops. The card was quickly errataed to only enchant opponents' artifacts.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 5 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Orcish%20Settlers)#### Orcish Settlers


*Weatherlight* uncommon.  
Pete Venters' art on this card is a parody of the famous Grant Wood painting "American Gothic."
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 4 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wasteland)#### Wasteland


*Tempest* uncommon.  
When Strip Mine was restricted, R&D tried their hands at a "fixed" Strip Mine. The results weren't quite what they hoped for, as Wasteland is almost as disruptive to game play as its older cousin.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 3 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ice%20Storm)#### Ice Storm


*Alpha* uncommon.  
In the first Magic set, green had a "Stone Rain." Since then, R&D has pushed red as the main land destruction color, and made green "earn" it a little more. Later green land destruction cards had double-green in their mana costs.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 2 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Avalanche%20Riders)#### Avalanche Riders


*Urza's Legacy* uncommon.  
Even though Olle Råde was the first player to win the right to design a card from the Duelist Invitational, it was Darwin Kastle who got his actually made first. Darwin's card is the only one of the Invitational cards to not be rare.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 1 avril 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dingus%20Egg)#### Dingus Egg


*Alpha* rare.  
When the first Restricted List was created for tournaments, way back in the day, it contained (among others) the five Moxes, Black Lotus, Time Walk… and Dingus Egg. Land destruction was a serious problem back then, and the DCI hoped that restricting the Egg would cause players to back off.
