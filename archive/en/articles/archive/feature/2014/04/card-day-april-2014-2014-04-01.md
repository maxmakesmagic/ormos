[Dreadbringer Lampads](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreadbringer+Lampads) – *Journey into Nyx*. It's hard to see the interesting details in the art at card size, so here is part of the art description: "Only their faces and their clawed hands are clearly visible, with the rest of their bodies obscured by darkness. Shrieking, ghostly shapes are following them, streaming from what would be their hair into a single trailing vapor. The nymphs' face and skin bear jagged black markings that suggest madness and death."

[Whitewater Naiads](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitewater+Naiads) – *Journey into Nyx*. In Greek mythology, [naiads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naiad) were freshwater nymphs, although there was some overlap with their saltwater kin. Local cults worshipped naiads and some coming-of-age rites incorporated them. Despite the worship, naiads were said to have jealous personalities and could be dangerous beings.
