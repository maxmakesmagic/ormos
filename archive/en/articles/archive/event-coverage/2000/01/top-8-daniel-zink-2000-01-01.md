He was introduced to Magic when a few friends brought cards to their school around Mirage. He has been playing in tournaments for about a year and a half, and his major break came at Nationals this year, when Zink defeated many of the favorites to finish in first place with his CounterRebel deck. Zink also made top 8 at GP Cologne this year.


Zink played the same CounterRebel deck to a 6-1 finish on Friday, following it with a 5-2 draft record. "I did not have a specific draft strategy," admits Zink. "I ended up drafting black and red both times though." Zink is not optimistic about his chances in the quarter-finals tomorrow. "I already played Eder on day one, and he beat me then. He has matchup advantage, and it will be difficult for me to win."
