No one has ever had the perfect weekend. No one has ever won both a Pro Tour and a Masters on the same day. Jon Finkel pulled of a similarly impressive performance at Worlds 2000, leading Team USA to the team title and winning the individual crown for himself. That $45,000 is the richest payday to date, but if anyone can top it, it's Kai Budde. The German Juggernaut has already secured a spot for his team (Phoenix Foundation) in the Masters finals against Panzer Hunters, but he needs to win his next five consecutive matches if he wants a spot in the Pro Tour Top 8 as well.

Budde took on Mike Pustilnik in a round nine feature match that saw yet another clash between blue-green and mono-black. Budde had to mulligan before game 1 and he had to study carefully twice in order to find four lands, but the second Study put both [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) and [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) into play. Pustilnik Edicted away the Rootwalla and then traded his Shade for the Wurm. Pustilnik's second [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) then came down and dominated the board. Budde had no answer to the Shade nor did he have enough creatures to race it. Game 1 went to "Doctor P."

Budde took out his [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)s and a couple Careful Studies before game 2, replacing them with [Bearscape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bearscape), another [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), and two copies of [Stupefying Touch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stupefying+Touch). All the sideboards plans in the world can't help when you don't draw land, though. Budde took three "trips to Paris" during which he lamented "I'm main decking three [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)s and two [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval)s â€“ I thought my deck was really good against black." Pustilnik hadn't realized Budde had [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval)s main. Of course, there was no way for him to play around it anyway. He didn't need to play around much of anything in game 2. Budde settled on a four card hand with [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla), [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion), and [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), but zero lands. He drew his first land of the game on turn *six*.

Budde immediately asked Pustilnik if he wanted to play some fun games. Two more mulligans by Budde later, I walked away. Today just wasn't Kai's day.

Pro Tour Osaka marks the first time in over a year that there have been back-to-back Pro Tours where Kai Budde didn't win one of them.

**Final Result:** Budde 0 - Pustilnik 2
