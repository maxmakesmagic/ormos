After discussion following the success of the return of best-of-five matches for Sunday playoffs at Pro Tours, we have decided to make a change to how sideboarding functions in best-of-five matches played on Sunday at Pro Tours and the *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.


Starting with [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi) in Madrid, Spain, the first two games played in a best-of-five playoff match on Sunday will be *pre-sideboard* games. After Game 2 is completed, players may change cards in and out from their sideboards and main decks in between games.
