Grand Prix Valencia 2013 - Marijn Lybaert vs. Marcos Yustas
===========================================================



 Posted in **Event Coverage**
 on November 10, 2013 










Marijn Lybaert certainly is no stranger to the feature match area. At recent Grand Prix, the Belgian could often be seen as an expert doing commentary for our live video coverage and, as a player, Lybaert has a whopping four Pro Tour Top 8s to his name. Marcos Yustas from Spain doesn't have anything close to such a résumé, but he did manage to achieve the same result in the tournament so far. Both players had had two byes and won their respective round-three matches., both with aggressive decks, green-red for Yustas, red-black for Lybaert.

After intial trade-offs early on, the first game was all about Yustas's Centaur Battlemaster. Boon Satyr turned it into an already quite unreasonably large 10/8 creature, Time to Feed made that 13/11, and, incidentally, also killed Lybaert's at this point sole remaining blocker ...


The second game was a pure damage race. Lybaert entered with a couple of 2/1s, while Yustas had an Akroan Crusader. Leafcrown Dryad and Boon of Erebos traded, and then Akroan Crusader received the boon of Boon Satyr and put Lybaert at 10. Lybaert weighed his options. After some deliberation, he redoubled his efforts, bestowing Erebos's Emissary on his Satyr Rambler and bringing Yustas down to 7. However, [Destructive Revelry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Revelry) destroyed Erebos's Emissary and with it all hope for Lybaert to win this race. A second Akroan Crusader and Warriors' Lesson on both Crusaders generated enough attackers to seal the deal.
