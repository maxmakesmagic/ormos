![Feature Match: Höh vs. Carlsson](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/833.jpg)One of these players will get to "live the dream" in the Top 8 tomorrow. This is Ho's fourth Pro Tour, but he hasn't had any notable finishes except for a Grand Prix Top 8. This weekend is Carlsson's first Pro Tour, and it would certainly be a great accomplishment to make it to Sunday on the very first try.

### Game 1

![Behold Höh's intensity!](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/838.jpg)Carlsson started off with a first turn [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), and Hoh played [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key). A second [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) gave Carlsson plenty of mana, and [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus) came out on turn two. Hoh took his turn and played a Monolith, a Dynamo, a second Key, [Damping Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damping+Matrix) and [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), sacrificing the Matrix to put [Bosh, Iron Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosh%2C+Iron+Golem) into play. Carlsson played a Welder, along with [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire). Bosh got through for six damage, and Hoh played a red source in [Shivan Reef](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), and had enough mana to activate the artifact "Chuck" as well. 

Hoh 1 - Carlsson 0

### Game 2

![Simon Carlsson, so close to greatness](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/834.jpg)After some thought, Carlsson took a mulligan. Hoh played a Key, and Carlsson brought out [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker). Carlsson didn't have any explosive play when it became active, and instead played a [Welding Jar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welding+Jar) and a [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), then attacked with [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker). Hoh cast [Rack and Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rack+and+Ruin), targeting the [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) and the Monolith. The Monolith got to stick around thanks to [Welding Jar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welding+Jar), but the regeneration left it tapped where it wouldn't do much good. This was likely a mistake, as both players forgot that regenerating an artifact causes it to tap, and had to be reminded. In consequent turns, Carlsson was stuck with just two Cities of Brass, and spent every turn drawing and doing nothing else. [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) along with [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) got [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) into play and activated, while Hoh played more [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key)s to have all four copies out on the table. Carlsson's hand contained two [Rack and Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rack+and+Ruin), [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and two [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), and he then drew [Welding Jar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welding+Jar). Hoh used his [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) to untap Carlsson's Monolith, and cast Thirst of Knowledge, sending [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) to Carlsson's graveyard. Hoh used his other Keys to keep untapping the Monolith, and cast the other Thirst of Knowledge, this time discarding [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder) and [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors). Hoh played Greaves and [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) out of Carlsson's hand, and used both [Rack and Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rack+and+Ruin)s to destroy an artifact land, [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), the Greaves and Sphere. Carlsson was now out of resources, and Hoh's [Mystical Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor) for [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) was enough for Carlsson to concede.

Hoh 2 - Carlsson 0

After the match, Carlsson pointed out that Hoh should have put the Greaves on the Welder, and started [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) recursion.
