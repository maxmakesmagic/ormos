### Iceland



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc13/teams/Iceland.jpg)

*Iceland National Team* 
Call them the giant-killers. Despite only having twelve lifetime Pro Points between them, Team Iceland has carved a path through the tournament this weekend. Going in, they set their sights on a Top 32 finish, but after a 4-1 start they started to dream a little bigger. Winning their first two rounds to ensure Top 16, a kind of relaxed giddiness came over them. They needed a clutch win in the final round against Greece, and came up aces. Will their nothing-to-lose attitude give them an edge on Sunday?

### Czech Republic



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc13/teams/CzechRepublic.jpg)

*Czech Republic National Team* 
Captain Stanislav Cifka may have missed the Top 4 in the 2013 **Magic** World Championship, but he refused to give up on Sunday play. Though his teammates are relative amateurs (without a single Pro Point to their names) they worked hard this weekend, and a 4-3 performance got them in to pool play. Once there, they staked their claim with a dominating sweep of their first group. They split their first two matches in the second stage, but defeated South Africa in the final round to secure Top 8. Will the chessmaster guide his team to greatness, or will a more experienced team overtake them?

 It's still a long journey to win the tournament. I would be very happy if we finish in the Top 4 in order to qualify my mates for Pro Tour *Theros*.

**Grand Prix Top 8's:** 0

 Every minute of this tournament has been fantastic. But my favorite memory is the lucky croissant on the corner of the street near this place. This croissant cost me two euro, but it was also lucky. :)


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?**  

 Team Sealed, where I played control or big beasts.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 What would it mean to me? It would be a lot of pride for Stanislav Cifka. What would it mean for my country? It would mean everything.

 It would be a big success for me and my country.




### France



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc13/teams/France.jpg)

*French National Team* 
When you're captained by a Hall of Famer, you have to be a favorite to reach Sunday play. Raphaël Lévy is one of the game's longtime greats, and still competes at every Pro Tour. Last year his PT finishes were 97th, 19th, and 37th, showing that he's still got what it takes. Adding to his star power you have this year's Grand Prix London winner, Timothée Simonot. After sweeping their first pool to make Top 16, they dropped their first round against Israel and were forced to win out to make it into the Top 8. In Unified Standard, Lévy's Mono-Green concoction has been turning heads all weekend. Will it be the backbone of a trophy-winning performance?



 


### Timothée Simonot


**Hometown:** Fougeres


**Occupation:** Writer for Lotus Noir, the French magazine


**Lifetime Pro Points:** 44


**Pro Tour Top 8's:** 0


**Grand Prix Top 8's:** 1


**Which format did you coach?** None.


**What is your favorite memory from the World Magic Cup thus far?**   

 When I saw the Ranger's Guile in Raphaël Lévy's hand against Shahar Shenhar's Olivia Voldaren. It meant Top 8.


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?**  
*Return to Ravnica* Limited. I played Grixis control.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 To me, it would mean I reached my ultimate **Magic** dream. To my country it would mean that we have won all the titles it is possible to win at **Magic**.




 


### Raphaël Lévy


**Hometown:** Toulouse


**Occupation:** Publisher of JITS Magazine France


**Lifetime Pro Points:** 546


**Pro Tour Top 8's:** 3


**Grand Prix Top 8's:** 18


**Which format did you coach?** None of them.


**What is your favorite memory from the World Magic Cup thus far?**   

 Winning the deciding game versus Shahar and Israel. Very tense.


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?**  

 I was scared of the RTR Sealed Deck format, but I have to say I enjoyed playing Standard with Mono-Green.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 France is missing this title (Team World Champion). I'd be super proud to bring the trophy back.




 


### Yann Guthmann

**Grand Prix Top 8's:** 0

**What is your favorite memory from the World Magic Cup thus far?**   

 When we found a new secret nickname for Tim. And also when Raph told me hwon, meaning Top 8.


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?**  

 Standard because it was the only one I played. I played UW Flash because there's Islands in it.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 I would be very proud and happy to win. Could I also say hi to the MCC and Mikael?




 


### Soubrier Stephane


**Hometown:** Paris

**Pro Tour Top 8's:** 0


**Grand Prix Top 8's:** 1


**Which format did you coach?** Standard


**What is your favorite memory from the World Magic Cup thus far?**   

 The combat phase of Raph which meant Top 8, or maybe the combat phase of mosquitoes against Raph in our bedroom.


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?**  

 Limited


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 A lot of pride because it would be the first time for my country. Also, it's the world champion's title. It rocks!




### Austria



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc13/teams/Austria.jpg)

*Austrian National Team* 
Another team for whom anything less than Top 8 would be a disappointment, Austria boasts two Pro Tour Top 8 finishers on its roster: Thomas Holzinger and David Reitbauer. They both also have multiple appearances on the national team. Marc Mühlbock has Pro Tour experience under his belt. Only seventeen-year-old Manuel Danninger is at his first big dance. They didn't have much of a sweat this weekend, though. They cruised through Day One at 5-1-1 and then swept their first pool. Will that dominance carry through to tomorrow and give them the title?



 


### David Reitbauer


**Hometown:** Vienna


**Occupation:** Controller


**Lifetime Pro Points:** 111

**Grand Prix Top 8's:** 1


**Which format did you coach?** I'm a bad coach, so I always had to play.

 Standard, RG Aggro


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 A lot of fun in Amsterdam.




### Estonia



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc13/teams/Estonia.jpg)

*Estonian National Team* 
Estonia is being represented by two returning members from last year's squad: Simon Robberts and Hannes Kerem, the all-time leader in Pro Points for Estonia. Kerem has seen a good amount of success on the World stage, experience he'll be able to use to help his team. At Worlds in 2008, Kerem managed to defeat Hall of Famer Kenji Tsumura to advance to the Semifinals before being eliminated. Last year, he and Robberts led the team to an 11th place finish in the inaugural World **Magic** Cup. Entering the final Stage as the second seed in their pool, Estonia had complete control of their destiny. After dispatching Croatia in the first round, Estonia went on to run the table, exiting the final Stage a perfect 3-0, earning their spot in the Top 8.



 


### Mikk Kaasik

Standard, Black-White-Red Aristocrats.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 It would be my best achievement in Magic. I am proud to represent my country. The media coverage might make Magic more popular in Estonia.

 WiGoing 5-1 with a Unified Standard deck I picked up the night before the tournament.


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?**  

 Standard, Kibler's Red-Green Aggro


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 For me it would boost my future Magic career greatly, with a Pro Tour invitation and the prize money to travel. I hope our achievement will motivate new and old players in my country to reach greater heights.




 


### Hannes Kerem


**Hometown:** Keila


**Occupation:** Football Trader


**Lifetime Pro Points:** 49


**Pro Tour Top 8's:** 1

 I guess it would solve some money problems?

 To me, more than I set as a personal goal.  

 To Estonia: Put Estonia on the map and show our community!




### Hungary



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc13/teams/Hungary.jpg)

*Hungarian National Team* 
Featuring two of the more experienced members in the field, Hungary had a lot to prove after a semifinal exit in last year's World **Magic** Cup. Led by captain Tamas Nagy and Gabor Kocsis, first and second place all-time on Hungary's list of Pro players, Hungary has one of the most deceptively strong teams in the field. Considering Tamas Nagy's decision to coach rather than play during the Constructed rounds, they will have his leadership to rely on for their trek through the Top 8.



 


### Tamas Nagy


**Hometown:** Balmazvavaros


**Occupation:** IT Manager


**Lifetime Pro Points:** 75


**Pro Tour Top 8's:** 0


**Grand Prix Top 8's:** 1


**Which format did you coach?** Standard.

 Standard. I coached Jund and UWR Flash at the same time.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 It would improve our Top 4 finish from last year.

**Hometown:** Budapest/Munich


**Occupation:** Global Key Account Manager


**Lifetime Pro Points:** 0


**Pro Tour Top 8's:** 0


**Grand Prix Top 8's:** 0


**Which format did you coach?** None. I played all rounds.


**What is your favorite memory from the World Magic Cup thus far?**   

 Winning our win-and-in against Ireland to make Top 8.


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?**  

 Team Unified Standard. I played Jund Midrange. It was very interesting to test and find decks with no overlap.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 A lot. Back to back Top 8s for Hungary, a small country with a great Magic community.




 


### Ervin Hosszu


**Hometown:** Zalaegerszeg


**Occupation:** Student


**Lifetime Pro Points:** 0


**Pro Tour Top 8's:** 0


**Grand Prix Top 8's:** 0


**Which format did you coach?** Team Sealed.


**What is your favorite memory from the World Magic Cup thus far?**   

 Topdecking a Sphinx's Revelation at nine lands, close to death, in a must-win game in the final round of the tournament. It was so cool!!!


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?**  

 Standard. UWR Flash.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 Back to back Top 8 is pretty good for a country like ours that is smaller. For me, it would show that I can play well under pressure.




 


### Gabor Kocsis


**Hometown:** Budapest


**Occupation:** Card Shop owner at [www.metagames.hu](http://www.metagames.hu)


**Lifetime Pro Points:** 55


**Pro Tour Top 8's:** 0

 Advancing through the Sealed Pool play with a 1-2 record for the second time after last year. And, of course, making Top 8 again! :)


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?**  
***Magic** 2014*  Sealed Deck. Hungarian (Naya) Slivers.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 It would mean that we improved since last year's Top 4. Maybe it would help us in getting a GP in Budapest!




### New Zealand



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc13/teams/NewZealand.jpg)

*New Zealand National Team* 
Led by Grand Prix Auckland champion Walker Macmurdo, all four members of the New Zealand National team have experience on the Pro Tour. With the second most successful player in New Zealand **Magic** history on the team, last year's captain Jason Chung, there is a wealth of experience both in individual and team play to draw from. While New Zealand had never made the Top 8 of a team competition, this year marked the strongest team they have assembled, and their combined efforts were enough to crack that barrier for the first time.

**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 Everything. This is probably my last ever big tournament. I would love to go out with a bang.

**Pro Tour Top 8's:** 0


**Grand Prix Top 8's:** 1


**Which format did you coach?** Standard – Both days!


**What is your favorite memory from the World Magic Cup thus far?**   

 The fifth turn of extra turns against the Chilean team in the last round, when they couldn't kill Digby and we advanced to the Top 8!!!!


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?**  
***Magic** 2014*  Sealed Deck. I had an excellent monored deck and I love playing aggressive decks in Limited.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 For me, it would be great to do my second home proud!

 Just the experience of playing on our team – great camaraderie.


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?**  

 I only played Standard – UWR Flash.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 Winning (but also making Top 8) is great in that NZ has never had a Pro Tour Top 8. It feels great to represent for the community back home, who are always helpful and have sustained my interest in playing tournament **Magic** for 15 years!

 Unified Standard. Lizard Wizard Surprise.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 It would increase my ego. And Reuben Wilson might stop calling me bad.




### Belgium



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc13/teams/Belgium.jpg)

*Team Belgium* 
Much ado was made about the Belgian squad coming into this tournament. Featuring two of the biggest names in European **Magic**, Vincent Lemoine and Marijn Lybaert, Belgium was commonly thought to be second only to Sweden in raw power and talent. After a disappointing Day 1, barely squeaking into Day 2 by virtue of a last-round win, Belgium turned on the afterburners, shoving their way through the final rounds of play, including a marathon match against Brazil in the final round that they won by virtue of only a single match win, the others going to time.

 Standard – Golgari (but I do not like the deck) on the second day, Gruul on the first day.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 People in Belgium could get motivated to be more competitive.

 Standard (first day I played Golgari, the second I played Gruul)


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?**  

 I think it would be a huge boost and might get some people back on the train.
