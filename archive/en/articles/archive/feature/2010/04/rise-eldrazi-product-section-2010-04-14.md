But before we get to the big news, allow us to draw your attention to the new article about Gideon Jura and the *Rise of the Eldrazi* version of Sarkhan Vol. And the puzzle and wallpaper! Those are also cool.


But there's no denying that the big draw this time out is the **complete Visual Spoiler**. The entire set is ready for viewing. Enjoy!
