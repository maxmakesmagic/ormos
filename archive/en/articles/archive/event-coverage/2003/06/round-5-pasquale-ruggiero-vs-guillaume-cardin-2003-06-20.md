Sure, they'd swept the first three rounds of standard, but after falling in round four they assumed there would be others that merited the spotlight. Ruggiero is just coming off a big Top 4 appearance at Grand Prix – Pittsburgh with Phoque Foundation, while Cardin got here the hard way, through last night's grinders.

### Game 1

Both players curved out nicely in the first game. Ruggiero started with [Silver Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight), morph and [Aven Redeemer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Redeemer), but Cardin matched him with [Stonewood Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonewood+Invoker), [Wall of Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Mulch) and [Screeching Buzzard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Buzzard). He waited for Ruggiero to play a spell, [Dive Bomber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber), and then scooped two lands with [Sprouting Vines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Vines). [Fierce Empath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fierce+Empath) got him a [Krosan Tusker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker), but now Ruggiero was swinging with his Knight, morph and [Dive Bomber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber). He took one hit, but had a trick up his sleeve a turn later. Cardin blocked the morph with [Fierce Empath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fierce+Empath) and the Knight with the Invoker, then cycled [Gempalm Strider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Strider). Ruggiero paid five life to flip up his Cutthroat, but it was still a blow. The Tusker got Cardin a second mountain, and he tapped all his lands to play [Bladewing the Risen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladewing+the+Risen). Ruggiero gave him the flack appropriate for such a deep splash.

The appearance of the dragon ground the game to a halt. A second Redeemer made it so that Bladewing couldn't attack. Both players added creatures to the board. A [Swat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat) on the [Dive Bomber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) cleared a path for the dragon, especially with three swamps and three mountains to activate it, but after one hit, Ruggiero pulled up [Improvised Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Improvised+Armor) for one of his Redeemers. Again they fell to drawing cards. Cardin got two good ones in quick succession: [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf) and [Dirge of Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirge+of+Dread). That was enough to take it.

Cardin 1 – Ruggiero 0

### Game 2

Ruggiero had to mulligan, and the six that followed weren't great. Cardin started with [Gempalm Strider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Strider) and Ruggiero had no third-turn play. Fortunately, Cardin had to spend his third waiting on a [Sprouting Vines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Vines). He got two swamps after Ruggiero played a [Dive Bomber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber). [Wirewood Channeler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Channeler) followed. Ruggiero put [Dragon Scales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Scales) on his Bomber and hit for three. Cardin answered with a turn-five Bladewing.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a961.jpg)Ruggiero was the picture of calm, though. He tapped four and enchanted his Bomber with [Improvised Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Improvised+Armor), turning it into a 5/9. It started to take huge chunks out of Cardin's life total. Eventually he had enough mana to put Bladewing in front of it, but a surprise [Gravel Slinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravel+Slinger) sent the legend to the graveyard. With him out of the way, the inevitability of the monster [Dive Bomber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) was too much to handle.

Cardin 1 – Ruggiero 1

### Game 3

Again Ruggiero had to mulligan, and again Cardin led with [Gempalm Strider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Strider). He followed with [Fierce Empath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fierce+Empath) to get his Bladewing. Ruggiero made a morph and passed it back. Cardin swung in and asked "Two or five?" wondering if the morph was [Zombie Cutthroat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Cutthroat). Ruggiero let the Strider pass. He pumped the fist when Cardin cycled [Swat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat), but Cardin pulled a forest and dropped a face-up [Broodhatch Nantuko](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodhatch+Nantuko).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a962.jpg)Ruggiero was stuck on three lands, and played out his [Cloudreach Cavalry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudreach+Cavalry). Again the Strider attacked, but this time Ruggiero had a response. He flipped up his [Proteus Machine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Proteus+Machine) and turned it into a bird, empowering the Cavalry and tackling the Strider. You could see Cardin wince at the beat.

Still, he had a plan. [Wirewood Channeler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Channeler) came down to help power out his dragon. Ruggiero made a morph and passed it back. Cardin needed another mountain or swamp to get his dragon, so he bade his time by searching up a Tusker with [Fierce Empath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fierce+Empath), and then Channeled out [Symbiotic Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Elf). Ruggiero put a stop to his fiendery by turning over [Skirk Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Marauder) and shooting down the Channeler.

With that done, Cardin's board seemed pretty pathetic. The Cavalry was still owning the skies and all Cardin could do was play [Sprouting Vines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Vines). [Aven Liberator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Liberator) joined Ruggiero's team and Cardin was short on time. He made a Gourna when he was at four, but Ruggiero dropped [Improvised Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Improvised+Armor) on his Cloudreach, and then morphed a second Liberator to take the game.

**Final Result:** Pasquale Ruggiero defeats Guillaume Cardin 2-1
