Let's jump right in! Here's what you chose in [last week's](/en/articles/archive/dungeon-2004-11-16) “Constructing Preconstructed” polls:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/magic_expansion_chk_td4LargePic_en.jpg)Way of the Warrior and *Kamigawa* Block Constructed, here I come! These are great choices, actually, because they involve the most straightforward preconstructed deck with the pool of cards that most supports the precons. As a result, I expect this experiment to be very accessible to beginners.


Before I get started, let me provide a quick recap of what I'm doing and what guidelines I'm following to do it:


**Recap**: I'm taking a preconstructed deck and slowly changing it over four weeks into something that's fun to play in the Casual Constructed room of ***Magic** Online*.


### The Guidelines:


1. The goal is to make a fun deck to play that wins its fair share of games in the Casual Constructed room of ***Magic** Online*. This is not an effort to make a competitive tournament deck.


2. This experiment is meant to be entertaining for all sorts of players, but I particularly want ***Magic** Online* beginners to find it accessible. As a result:


* I may be explaining some basic principles in the articles.
* I will be trying to keep expensive rares out of the deck (but not avoiding them if I think they significantly enhance the deck).

3. I will not make changes to the deck until playing at least five games with each current decklist.


4. I will change no more than five cards per revision.


Also, a caveat: I will probably repeat a lot in the next month that I'm making a pet deck for me, me, me. At almost every turn I will likely make different choices than you. That's okay. This experiment is meant to be fun to read, inspire creativity, and illustrate some deckbuilding concepts. If you don't like what I'm building, by all means make your own deck and beat me with it in the Casual room.


Now that all of the preliminaries are out of the way...


### Way of the Warrior - The Beginning


Below is the deck you're given when you first purchase Way of the Warrior. You can also load this deck into your Deck Editor by going into your “themedecks” folder. I've done what I usually do with decklists, separated the land from the creatures from the non-land/non-creatures and sorted by frequency and cost. For me, this is a way to really understand the deck I'm playing.

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Plains)


















Many regular constructed players are sure to see this decklist, cringe, and start changing it dramatically. Why? Because the deck is underpowered and inconsistent even for average casual play. There will be no dramatic changes for me, though; Such behavior flies in the face of this experiment. I'm going to play this sucker as-is until I have a feel for its strengths, weaknesses, and card interactions.


Here are some eyeballed impressions before I've played a single game:


*1) Deck Themes.* One impressive thing about this preconstructed deck over a lot of others is that it's relatively focused. Here are the deck themes as I see them:


* Major theme: Playing Samurai and smashing face.
* Minor theme 1: Improving your Samurai via combat tricks, Enchant Creatures, and Equipment.
* Minor theme 2: Creature removal.
* Very minor theme 1: Splice onto Arcane.
* Very minor theme 2: Flipping [Bushi Tenderfoot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bushi+Tenderfoot).

The nice thing is that the major theme (Samurai) and the two minor themes work together quite nicely. Some of you may be wondering why I even listed the two very minor themes, but in my mind these are seeds that I could choose to grow as I play the deck. That is, I might decide that the most fun thing about the deck is either Splicing [Candles' Glow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Candles%27+Glow) repeatedly or getting [Kenzo the Hardhearted](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kenzo+the+Hardhearted) into play, and then evolve the deck accordingly.


*2) Mana.* It's monowhite, so that makes the mana easy. That's a wonky manacurve, though. The deck has mostly quick, low-cost spells and then hopes to cast seven spells of either four or six mana. Frankly, twenty-four Plains sounds like too much for an aggressive deck but necessary if you want to reliably get [Takeno, Samurai General](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takeno%2C+Samurai+General) into play. This is something I'll have to resolve eventually.


Speaking of mana, don't think that just because the deck is currently monowhite that it's going to stay that way. For example, green provides things like [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need) and better creature-enhancers, black and red provide better creature removal and their own Samurai, and blue provides card-drawing, counters, and its own assortment of combat tricks. Any of these are viable directions to take the deck.


*3) Consistency.* A big criticism of preconstructed decks is their lack of consistency since they are usually comprised of one- and two-copies of cards. The good news about Way of the Warrior is that since it's pretty focused, many of the cards serve duplicate purposes and thus the single copies don't stand out as much. That said, expect the final decklist to have a lot more 3- and 4-copies of cards.


*4) Power.* Another criticism of preconstructed decks is that they are filled with cards that are, let's say, less than optimal, even for casual decks. I'm not willing to cut cards like [Vigilance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigilance) yet because I haven't played them, but the first changes I make will be to identify the heart of the deck and trim the rest.


*5) Fun.* Some people absolutely love “White Weenie” decks (decks trying to win with small, fast white creatures) and some people think they're boring. I tend to fall in the middle, appreciating the (cough) elegance of WW strategies while also needing my decks to have some tricks up their sleeves. I'm not sure yet what this means for how much I'll change the current central theme of the deck, but don't rule out me eventually focusing on one of those very minor themes.


That's enough waxing philosophic with no data behind me. It's time to jump in and start playing. Although I'm sure to lose a lot of my games early on, I hope to learn the deck and what's fun (for me) about it.


### Playing Preconstructed


It's less difficult to find a *Kamigawa* Block game in the Casual room than I had feared. Hopefully after this article it will be even less difficult to find games. Anyway, here's a recap of my inaugural games...


*Game 1: Green/Blue Azusa deck*


 



![Konda's Hatamoto](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Konda%27s+Hatamoto)

His deck was very cool, built around [Azusa, Lost But Seeking](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azusa%2C+Lost+But+Seeking) in combination with things like [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), [Soratami Mirror-Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soratami+Mirror-Mage), and [Strength of Cedars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+of+Cedars). I got a [Devoted Retainer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Retainer) and [Konda's Hatamoto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%27s+Hatamoto), then a second Hatamoto. I plink him down to fifteen life, twelve, ten, eight, six, but eventually he got Azusa going full steam and I died to a 10/9 Strength of Cedared Mirror-Mage. I had two [Vigilance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigilance) in hand the whole game, unwilling to cast them because a) I didn't see how they would help my board position against fliers, and b) I didn't want to lose my enchantment from bounce.

*Game 2: Green/Red Spirits*


The game started out amusingly enough. I dropped three [Devoted Retainer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Retainer)s and he dropped three [Kami of the Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+the+Hunt). The difference was that I attacked into his guys and he didn't attack into mine. A [Candles' Glow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Candles%27+Glow) helped me stay ahead in the creature race. He played [Soilshaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soilshaper) and I responded with [Kitsune Blademaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitsune+Blademaster). My opponent started chump-blocking to stay alive and when I played [Samurai Enforcers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+Enforcers) he conceded. Except for the [Candles' Glow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Candles%27+Glow) all I did was drop land and creatures and attack. The result: Way of the Warrior's first win!


*Game 3: Green/Blue Azusa deck*


 



![No-Dachi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=No-Dachi)

I think this was the same player and the same deck from Game 1, but I'm not sure. This time around, though, I got him to two life with a combination of [Devoted Retainer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Retainer) equipped with [No-Dachi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=No-Dachi), [Konda's Hatamoto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%27s+Hatamoto), and [Takeno, Samurai General](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takeno%2C+Samurai+General). He got [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror), which I removed with [Reciprocate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reciprocate), but the two Illusions he created go the distance. At one point he used [Strength of Cedars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+of+Cedars) to get me to one life, but I used [Candles' Glow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Candles%27+Glow) to give me an extra turn. It was a fairly back-and-forth game, though it was frustrating playing Enchant Creature cards against a deck with lots of bounce. Afterwards he said “Your deck is really cool” and I didn't have the heart to tell him it was a precon.

*Game 4: Green/Red Aggro*


His deck had [Kami of the Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+the+Hunt), [Kumano, Master Yamabushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%2C+Master+Yamabushi), [Kodama of the South Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+South+Tree), and [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker). Basically, then, he ran me over. I was only able to generate a [Mothrider Samurai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mothrider+Samurai) with [No-Dachi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=No-Dachi) and [Vigilance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigilance) support. The Samurai did eight damage and survived thanks to [Reciprocate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reciprocate) on his Kumano, but there was no way I was going to win that damage race. This was the first game I realized that I have only twenty creatures to go along with eleven spells that require creatures. That's not a good balance, it seems to me.


*Game 5: 5-Color Hondens*


I was excited to keep a hand of both [Reciprocate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reciprocate)s and a [Cage of Hands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cage+of+Hands), but it quickly became apparent that my opponent's deck was near creatureless. I plink away with a [Devoted Retainer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Retainer) (with [Vigilance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigilance)!) and a [Kitsune Blademaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitsune+Blademaster) died to [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray). I got four Plains and two [Mothrider Samurai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mothrider+Samurai) into play as he got two Shrines, and it slid quickly downhill from there. In almost no time at all, he had all five Shrines, [Orochi Hatchery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orochi+Hatchery) with three counters on it, and I was dead. Note to self: This deck can't deal with opposing enchantments or artifacts.


So after five games, what have I learned?


* Yes, the manacurve is wonky.
* Yes, [Vigilance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigilance) is, like, not very good. On a positive note, I do manage to draw it every game.
* I can't deal with fliers.
* I can't deal with enchantments of artifacts.
* The deck doesn't have enough creatures to support its creature-enhancers.
* [Candles' Glow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Candles%27+Glow) and [Reciprocate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reciprocate) are surprisingly cool.

That's probably enough information to make my first changes. Here we go...


### Bring the Curtain


**OUT**: 2 [Vigilance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigilance)


To the deck's credit, [Vigilance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigilance) is the only truly easy card to drop. The reason it's so easy is that it just doesn't do enough to warrant a spot in the deck. Yes, it lets you use Bushido to both attack and block, but you need a creature first and that creature shouldn't be [Konda's Hatamoto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%27s+Hatamoto) if you're planning on playing a legend. Also, the creatures are fairly expendable here, so you're almost always giving your opponent a two-for-one advantage if you play this on, say, a [Devoted Retainer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Retainer). If these slots had an enchantment that gave all of your creatures vigilance, that would be one thing. If this were [Dragon Scales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Scales) that gave a power/toughness bonus and could come back into play on Takeno, that would be something too. As it is... yuck.


**OUT**: 2 [Samurai Enforcers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+Enforcers)


It may seem weird to drop two Samurai right away, especially the largest in the deck. But that's exactly the point--[Samurai Enforcers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+Enforcers) are too slow and clunky for a deck trying to overwhelm an opponent with weenies. They also don't allow you to hold back mana for your Instant-speed tricks the turn you cast them. Sure, my second opponent conceded after I played my Enforcers, but that was the only time I was able to cast them in five games (and not for lack of drawing them, either). I like the idea that Takeno stands at the top of the manacurve all by his lonesome. Maybe these will come back in if I decide to make the deck less focused on weenies, but for now [Samurai Enforcers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+Enforcers) just look out of place.


**IN**: 4 [Samurai of the Pale Curtain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+of+the+Pale+Curtain)


 



![Samurai of the Pale Curtain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Samurai+of+the+Pale+Curtain)

Normally my early changes would focus on adding extra copies of cards that already exist in the deck. Making a Samurai deck without [Samurai of the Pale Curtain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+of+the+Pale+Curtain), though, just seems silly. It has the best cost-to-power ratio of any Samurai and it has a very useful effect in *Kamigawa* Block where Spirits run rampant. It's also an uncommon that is very reasonable to acquire via trading. I don't feel like I can really test my interest in a white-based Samurai deck if I don't have these in here, so best to rip off the band-aid now.

Of course, adding [Samurai of the Pale Curtain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+of+the+Pale+Curtain) puts a Mark of Death on [Bushi Tenderfoot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bushi+Tenderfoot). I would drop him now except that so far I haven't played him. One of my unspoken rules is to not drop a card without having tried it first. Watch out, though, little Tenderfoot.


That puts the decklist here:

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Plains)


















Let's see what effect, if any, making these changes has on the deck:


*Game 6: White/Red Samurai*


 



![Bushi Tenderfoot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bushi+Tenderfoot)

It looked to me like my opponent had also bought a Way of the Warrior and modified it, adding red burn (and, presumably, Samurai) and [Samurai of the Pale Curtain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+of+the+Pale+Curtain). I was tickled because I had an opening hand with my new Samurai and [Bushi Tenderfoot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bushi+Tenderfoot) (finally). I played a [Devoted Retainer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Retainer), he played his own Tenderfoot, I played [Samurai of the Pale Curtain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+of+the+Pale+Curtain), he played [Cage of Hands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cage+of+Hands) on my Samurai, I played [No-Dachi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=No-Dachi), and it went on from there. My 3/1 [Devoted Retainer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Retainer) went the distance, surprisingly, and I got a second [No-Dachi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=No-Dachi) on a [Mothrider Samurai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mothrider+Samurai) to outmuscle his own Mothrider. [Blessed Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Breath) countered a key [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) that helped a lot too. I tell ya, it's nice to win immediately after making changes.

*Game 7: Green/Red Legends deck*


His deck had [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need) and [Commune with Nature](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commune+with+Nature) to play things like [Kodama of the South Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+South+Tree) and [Brothers Yamazaki](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brothers+Yamazaki), along with Arcane spells and [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami). I was proud of my little deck, actually. I played out quick creatures to put pressure on him, then used tricks like [Indomitable Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indomitable+Will), [Blessed Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Breath), and [Call to Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Glory) to get card advantage and keep my creatures alive. I won at twelve life, feeling in control the entire time despite his impressive spells.


*Game 8: White/Red Samurai*


Ooooo... Samurai free-for-all! That was pretty much what it felt like, too. We traded blows and were playing pretty much the same creatures, except that he was able to find two [Nagao, Bound by Honor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nagao%2C+Bound+by+Honor) and two [Brothers Yamazaki](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brothers+Yamazaki). Still, I had the combat tricks on my side. An [Indomitable Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indomitable+Will) and [Blessed Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Breath) completely messed up his Bushido-math, and he was put on the defensive as a result. Two [No-Dachi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=No-Dachi) didn't help either, as I was able to keep attacking without losing my creatures. He dropped me to six life, but eventually I overwhelmed him.


*Game 9: Green/Blue/Red Honden*


 



![Otherworldly Journey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Otherworldly+Journey)

This deck was a lot like the other Honden deck, except that it used a heck of a lot of Arcane and Splice spells. Once again I was happy to see [Reciprocate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reciprocate)s in my opening hand and once again they were pretty much useless in this matchup. The good news was that I had a lot of early pressure, and all he could find initially was [Honden of Seeing Winds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honden+of+Seeing+Winds). He misclicked so that he had to cast his [Consuming Vortex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consuming+Vortex) instead of Splice it, which was pretty much game. I got to cast my first [Otherworldly Journey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otherworldly+Journey) towards the end, which for some reason made me extremely happy.

*Game 10: Green/Black Spirit/Arcane deck*


He had a first-turn [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami), but I had a second-turn [Samurai of the Pale Curtain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+of+the+Pale+Curtain). He said “that's pretty much game,” but I didn't see why if he had any sort of creature removal in his deck. I got a nice smooth draw to drop Samurai on my first four turns, then could sit back with a grip full of tricks in case he tried to do something sneaky. He played a [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), [Soilshaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soilshaper), [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), and another [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) in desperate search for a Dragon, but all that happened was that he had loads of land and I kept attacking.


*Game 11: Monoblack Spirits*


He got stuck on three Swamps and I got stuck on three Plains. The difference was that I had lots of low-cost creatures and he was struggling to find anything he could cast. I basically ran him over without much difficulty.


It's amazing how big a difference a little change can make. I'm 6-0 since adding [Samurai of the Pale Curtain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+of+the+Pale+Curtain), which has made an appearance in all six games. Neat. Some of these results are dumb luck and random variation, but I don't think you can totally discount them.


Of course, I'm not done making changes.


**OUT**: 1 [Bushi Tenderfoot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bushi+Tenderfoot)


I warned you. It's actually possible to get [Kenzo the Hardhearted](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kenzo+the+Hardhearted) into play with this deck via [Indomitable Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indomitable+Will), [Blessed Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Breath), [No-Dachi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=No-Dachi), [Candles' Glow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Candles%27+Glow), and [Hold the Line](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+the+Line). The problem is twofold. First, having [Bushi Tenderfoot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bushi+Tenderfoot) out is a distraction. I worry that I spend too much time trying to flip him instead of using the aforementioned cards to save my better creatures. Second, as I said, [Samurai of the Pale Curtain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+of+the+Pale+Curtain) weakens [Bushi Tenderfoot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bushi+Tenderfoot) considerably. Without Mr. Tenderfoot, the deck has no cards that rely on the graveyard.


**OUT**: 1 [Hold the Line](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+the+Line)


I know it's one of the only two rares in the deck. Dropping a rare from a precontructed deck just feels wrong, especially so early. The only problem is that I have held [Hold the Line](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+the+Line) in several games and have never seen an opportunity to cast it. My deck just doesn't block all that often, to be honest, and when it does the other tricks in the deck are cheaper and more effective. It's a great card to play in conjunction with [Call to Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Glory), I suppose, but that isn't going to happen a lot. Ironically, [Hold the Line](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+the+Line) is probably the only card that got worse by ditching [Vigilance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigilance).


**IN**: 2 [Nagao, Bound by Honor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nagao%2C+Bound+by+Honor)


 



![Nagao, Bound by Honor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nagao%2C+Bound+by+Honor)

Whenever I play [Konda's Hatamoto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%27s+Hatamoto), which is quite often, I keep expecting him to be more than a 1/2 Bushido dude. Then it never happens. This should be no surprise since there are currently only two Legends in the deck: One copy each of Nagao and [Takeno, Samurai General](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takeno%2C+Samurai+General). If I'm going to spend three slots in my deck on [Konda's Hatamoto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%27s+Hatamoto), then I want a better shot at making him a 2/4 maneater. In fact, Nagao is everything [Samurai Enforcers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+Enforcers) tried to be in this deck. It's beefy, able to survive [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) and [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter), without being overly expensive. The fact that it combos so well with [Konda's Hatamoto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%27s+Hatamoto) is a significant bonus. Despite his legendary status, I want three copies to ensure I draw him more often.

I don't want to go overboard in changes the first week so I'll stop there. Notice what I've done so far: I've trimmed some of the cards that don't fit what the deck is trying to do and I've cut underpowered cards in favor of more (and better) Samurai. Now the mana makes more sense, as do the amount of creatures versus creature-enhancers. Already I have a deck that I'm not embarrassed by at all when I show up to my games.


Speaking of which, here's the current deck:

Whew. I don't usually spend a whole article on one topic, but hopefully today served as a good kick-start to this experiment and you see how it's going to work for the next three weeks (expect me to discuss other topics too, though). Feel free to speak up on the Message Boards about my decisions, what cards you think should be dropped next, and what cards you think should be added. I will definitely factor your opinions into my own decision-making.


For those in the United States, have a great Thanksgiving Holiday week!
