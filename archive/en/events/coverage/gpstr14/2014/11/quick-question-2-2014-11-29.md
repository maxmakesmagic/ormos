We asked some of the best players in the room about the most overrated card in *Khans of Tarkir* Limited. Here's what they had to say:

***Patrick Dickmann:** In draft, it's [Throttle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throttle). The card has never ever impressed me. I'd always rather cast another creature.*

***Willy Edel:** [Ainok Bond-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Bond-Kin). On turn three, you cast a morph, maybe another on turn four, then on turn five you really want to unmorph, and you basically never get to use outlast. Most people think [Ainok Bond-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Bond-Kin) is better than [Jeskai Student](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Student). I don't.*

***Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:** [Weave Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weave+Fate). Or [Tormenting Voice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormenting+Voice).* 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpstr14/qq_shenhar.jpg)
***Shahar Shenhar:** [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). It's the best card in the set, but it's still overrated. If that makes any sense.* 







![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpstr14/qq_anteri.jpg)
***Fabrizio Anteri:** [Barrage of Boulders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrage+of+Boulders).* 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpstr14/qq_juza.jpg)
***Martin JÅ¯za:** [Valley Dasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valley+Dasher). Maybe [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning).*
