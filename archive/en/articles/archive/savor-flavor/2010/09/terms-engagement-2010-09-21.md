The Terms of Engagement
=======================



 Posted in **Savor The Flavor**
 on September 22, 2010 










After a scant few rotations of our globe, *Scars of Mirrodin*[Prereleases](http://tukwizweb08.onlinegaming.local/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-facts) will begin. *Scars of Mirrodin* cards are scheduled to show up in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/) this very day. Mirrodin's time draws near. 

So it's time to arm yourself. And I don't mean with adventuring gear and grappling hooks—that's so *last year*. 

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/stf/stf109_mirrodin.jpg)  
Two entire civilizations, Mirrodin and Phyrexia, are on the brink of discovering one another. Each is a civilization founded on the fusion of flesh with metal. Each can claim rights to the shimmering plane of Mirrodin. Each has fractally complex internal structures, a network of factions and subfactions, and deep histories that trace back to the exploits of planeswalkers of old. 

This year, more than anything else, you need to come armed with *knowledge*.

To that end, today we present you with a glossary—nay, a *lore arsenal*—er, no, on second thought, glossary's fine—*über*glossary? nah—of Mirran and Phyrexian terms. Study it well, and even if you weren't plugged in to **Magic** flavor eight years ago, you too will be able to distinguish Ish Sah from the Kha and an Auriok from a Moriok. 

This glossary is actually adapted from an internal document we use to inform our translators what we mean by various words on the cards. But I've filled it in with a little more background, so you can actually use it as a mini-reference to the flavor of the setting and the brutal conflict to come. Ready? Let's start from the top.

Letter of the Week
Today's question comes from Tsilini, who has questions about Phyrexians and subtypes.


> Dear Doug Beyer,

> There's a question I've been thinking about since the *Lorwyn* creature type update, and with *Scars of Mirrodin* block featuring the creatures in question, I think now's a good time to ask.
> 
> Why don't the Phyrexians have a shared creature type? You'd think with their common grounds as the manufactured and grown servants of the glorious Lord Yawgmoth, as well as the glistening oil running through their veins, that they'd be affected by magic that can affect entire tribes.

There's no doubt there'd be utility in having a Phyrexian creature type, Tsilini. Seeing the word right on the card could lend some built-in flavor; it would be automatically clear what was a Phyrexian and what wasn't, and make it clear that this creature was a particular kind of Zombie or Horror. Furthermore, it could lend itself well to card designs that mention that creature type. There could be "lords" that give abilities to all Phyrexians (a la Hand of the Praetors), or on the other side, effects that wreak havoc on Phyrexians (a la [Undead Slayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Slayer)). Those are the "pros."

The first "con" is work. Although there's never been a Phyrexian creature type before, and although those involved with the [Grand Creature Type Update](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/424a3) a few years ago chose not to create one, *Scars of Mirrodin* represented another opportunity to investigate the issue again. It would have taken some serious work in Oracle to give all of the past Phyrexian-flavored cards the Phyrexian type, and there would have been some judgment calls. But that by itself was not enough of a reason; it would have been hard, but we could have done the overhaul necessary.

A more important "con" is the precedent set by the many Phyrexian creatures of the past. Phyrexia is mentioned on cards as far back as *Antiquities*, and was covered heavily from the *Tempest* block through the *Invasion* block. Phyrexian creatures are Horrors, Golems, Zombies, Carriers, Constructs, Skeletons, Insects, Beasts, a Dreadnought, and more. The effect of all those types is to give Phyrexia an impression of extreme diversity, even as it appeared almost exclusively on black and artifact creatures. It's unified in virtue of its disunity. Still, that's not really enough of a reason, either—the subtype "Phyrexian" could have been tacked on top of those other types while preserving their type diversity. "Phyrexian" is a long word, and it might have generated text-length issues with long type lines like "Artifact Creature — Phyrexian Blah" or "Legendary Creature — Phyrexian Blah," but those could have been dealt with case-by-case.

I feel there's another "con" in that giving a common creature type to every member of a civilization creates a strange, hard-to-follow precedent. Phyrexia isn't really a species of creature; it's not a race or a class. It's an *empire*, a *force*—a coalition of many kinds of creatures, from all walks of (what you might loosely call) life, all from a common origin and more or less unified toward a common goal. If every Phyrexian shares a type, then every Kamigawan should, too, and every Alaran (or Bantian?), and so on, even though those civilizations have deep schisms, subfactions, and internal conflicts within them. We want to portray Phyrexia as a real culture, kind of a "world in search of a plane," and a creature type on all of them sort of demotes Phyrexia to a one-sided bad guy.

A final "con" is that we got a lot of the functionality we wanted out of the watermarks. As you'll note at the prerelease, almost all of the *Scars of Mirrodin* cards have watermarks lightly traced behind the rules text that indicates which faction they belong to, either the Mirran side or the Phyrexian side. These will help you keep track of what's what even without a creature type, and even lets you identify artifacts and spells as being on one side or the other.

I'm not sure that any one of those "cons" would have been enough to kill the idea of a Phyrexian creature type, Tsilini, but taken together they tipped the scales for us. The benefits of a new subtype didn't outweigh the costs, especially once we decided we were going to do the Mirran and Phyrexian watermarks for the set. Watermarks can't do everything a creature type could do, but they did enough while disrupting little of Phyrexia's storied past.

Have a great time at the Prerelease, everyone. If you end up building a deck or making a play that feels especially Mirran or Phyrexian, let me know about it via the email link below! See you next week!
