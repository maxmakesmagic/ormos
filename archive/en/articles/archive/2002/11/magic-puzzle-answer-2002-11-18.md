Â 
The thing to remember is that you need to deal with both the Groundshaker and the Riders this turn. Here is the answer.


1. ![Contested Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Contested+Cliffs)

 Put the cards back on top of your library so [Contested Cliffs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+Cliffs) is on top and [Goblin Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Pyromancer) is second. (You won't get to the other two cards.)
2. Tap a forest for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) and cycle [Tranquil Thicket](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tranquil+Thicket). You draw [Contested Cliffs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+Cliffs).
3. Play [Contested Cliffs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+Cliffs).
4. Tap two mountains and an island for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif). Play [Threaten](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten) targeting Barbara's [Krosan Groundshaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Groundshaker).
5. Attack Barbara with the Groundshaker, [Goblin Sledder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder), [Charging Slateback](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charging+Slateback), and [Riptide Biologist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Biologist). She takes 12 damage and goes to 5.
6. Tap [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) to deal 2 damage to the Groundshaker and 2 damage to yourself. You go to 1 life.
7. Use [Goblin Sledder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder)'s ability, sacrificing [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith), to give [Elven Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders) +1/+1 until end of turn. They're now 4/4. (You could sacrifice the Sledder instead if you choose.)
8. Tap forest and mountain for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) and activate [Contested Cliffs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+Cliffs), targeting your Groundshaker and her [Elven Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders). [Elven Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders) takes 6 damage and is destroyed. The Groundshaker takes 4 damage and is destroyed.
9. End your turn.
10. On Barbara's turn, she draws mountain. The only thing she can do is play the mountain and [Venomspout Brackus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venomspout+Brackus).
11. On your turn, you draw [Goblin Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Pyromancer).
12. Play the Pyromancer. It gives itself and the Sledder +3/+0 until end of turn.
13. Attack with the Sledder, Slateback, and Biologist. Barbara can only block one of the creatures, meaning she takes a minimum of 5 damage. You win the game!
