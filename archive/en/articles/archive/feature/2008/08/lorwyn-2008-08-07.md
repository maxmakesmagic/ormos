#### Lorwyn
Lorwyn Cycle, Book 1


*by Cory Herndon and Scott McGough*
Elves live in a world of unforgiving perfection. It is survival of the fittest -- and none but the most beautiful and deadly are allowed to survive. So when an elf warrior's horns are shattered and his flawless features lost, he knows it is a death sentence. What he can't remember is how it happened or why he should allow himself to be killed. Powerful and ancient magic is at work, and the elf will need to find friends fast before his fellow elves quiet him -- permanently.

*Far from the strife of Dominaria lies Lorwyn, an idyllic world where races of fable thrive in perpetual midsummer. Lorwyn is covered with dense forests, meandering rivers, and gently rolling meadows. The sun never quite dips below the horizon, and winter is entirely unknown.*
