Justice for Emanuele Giusti!
============================




September 13-14, 2008












Grand Prix Rimini 2008
----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim08/winner.jpg)From 700 players to just one, and the young Italian, Emanuele Giusti, has vanquished them all. They came, he saw, he conquered!


A theme of this weekend has been how strong Italian Magic is right now, and it seemed inevitable that we would have an Italian champion with three of the semi-finalists being Italians – and none of them the household names that you may already have heard of. After dominating the Swiss rounds Matthias Künzler's long undefeated streak ended abruptly in the Quarter-Finals. The Japanese superstar Shuuhei Nakamura tried his best to upset the almost inevitable Italian homecoming win but fell to a shockingly swift defeat in the Final to the Kithkin armies of Emanuele Giusti, and we crown yet another new Grand Prix champion!


And that was Lorwyn/Shadowmoor Block Constructed. We began at Grand Prix-Birmingham with a Kithkin winner, and ended up here in Rimini with another Kithkin winner. Sandwiched between those two mono-white victories we've seen decks *of* every color, and decks *with* every color. While Shadowmoor may be a land of eternal night it has created a format with a glittering rainbow of colors and a constantly surprising metagame.


We look forward to meeting you again in just a month's time for Grand Prix-Paris, which will be fought out, for the first time, on the five Shards of Alara.


Until then, ‘Good Eventide' to you all!
