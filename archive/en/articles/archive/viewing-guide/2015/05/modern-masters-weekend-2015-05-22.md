*Modern Masters* Weekend is nearly here! You can find a full, detailed breakdown of which GPs you can watch and where over the course of the big weekend below!




---

**Day One**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/GP_City_Chiba.png)


The live video coverage of *Modern Masters* Weekend begins with Day One, Round 1 of [Grand Prix Chiba](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-chiba-2015)'s main event on the [Twitch *Magic* channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) at the following times, based on your time zone:



> 
> **Friday at 7 p.m. PT  
> 
> Friday at 10 p.m. ET  
> 
> Saturday at 2 a.m. UTC  
> 
> Saturday at 4 a.m. CET  
> 
> Saturday at 11 a.m. Local Time (JST)**
> 
> 
>

While Grand Prix Chiba is going on, [Grand Prix Utrecht](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-utrecht-2015)coverage will be kicking off over on the [Twitch *Magic*2 channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic2) at the following times, based on your time zone:



> 
> **Saturday at 2 a.m. PT  
> 
> Saturday at 5 a.m. ET  
> 
> Saturday at 9 a.m. UTC  
> 
> Saturday at 11 a.m. Local Time (CET)  
> 
> Saturday at 6 p.m. JST**
> 
> 
> 


Grand Prix Chiba will still be streaming when GP Utrecht coverage begins, giving you double the *Magic* to watch for a few hours.

Double the *Magic* is taken to a new level with Vegas. Grand Prix Las Vegas is of such an epic size that it will consist of *two* main events rather than one! You can catch all of the action from the first main event starting with Round 1 on the [Twitch *Magic* channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) at the following times:



> 
> **Saturday at 11 a.m. Local Time (PT)  
> 
> Saturday at 2 p.m. ET  
> 
> Saturday at 6 p.m. UTC  
> 
> Saturday at 8 p.m. CET  
> 
> Sunday at 3 a.m. JST**
> 
> 
> 


Meanwhile, you can catch all of the action of the second GP Vegas main event from our friends at [ChannelFireball](http://www.twitch.tv/channelfireball), where they'll be bringing dedicated coverage of that event all weekend.

**Day Two**


Day Two of the *Modern Masters* Weekend main events will see a bit of a shift of where each event will air, so pay attention!

> 
> 
>
