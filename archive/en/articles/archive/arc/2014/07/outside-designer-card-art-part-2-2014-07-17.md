A [couple weeks ago](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/outside-designer-card-art-part-1-2014-07-03) we explored some of the card art and descriptions for *Magic 2015*'s [outside-designer cards](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/working-some-best-minds-gaming-2014-06-30). We covered half last time, so let's take a look at the rest.


So, without further ado...enjoy!

[Goblin Kaboomist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Kaboomist) | Art by [Kev Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[%22Kev+Walker%22])


Color: Red Creature  

Location: open field; perhaps a battlefield  

Action: A goblin is bending down to dig a hole with a spade he's holding in one hand. In his other hand he has a round bomb with a lit fuse. He is so focused on digging that he hasn't noticed that the lit fuse has ignited another fuse that is arching over his shoulder from his backpack full of bombs.  

Focus: the goblin  

Mood: uh oh



Ob Nixilis, Unshackled

[Ob Nixilis, Unshackled](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ob+Nixilis%2C+Unshackled) | Art by [Karl Kopinski](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[%22Karl+Kopinski%22])


Setting: ZENDIKAR  

Color: Black legendary creature  

Location: Guul Draz, Zendikar in a basalt temple.  

Action: Show the demon Ob Nixilis. He is in his 2.0 state which means he is more powerful and has wings! And he no longer has the hedron shaped cross in his forehead. He looks at us like a starving tiger would look at a helpless fawn.  

Focus: Ob Nixilis  

Mood: Epic. The badass of all demons.



Spirit Bonds


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/cardart/cardart_spiritbonds.jpg)
[Spirit Bonds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Bonds) | Art by [Willian Murai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[%22Willian+Murai%22])


Setting: SHANDALAR  

Color: White spell  

Location: On a battlefield.  

Action: Standing with her sword at the ready is a female, African-skinned paladin warrior. Hovering over her is a spirit of an ancestor, a male warrior who is dressed in ceremonial armor and has a shield looking over her with protective care.  

Maybe fallen foes lie all around the paladin.  

Focus: The paladin and her protective spirit.  

Mood: Protection from beyond.



Yisan, the Wanderer Bard


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/cardart/cardart_yisanthewandererbard.jpg)
[Yisan, the Wanderer Bard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yisan%2C+the+Wanderer+Bard) | Art by [Chase Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[%22Chase+Stone%22])


Color: Green legendary creature  

Location: In a field by a forest.  

Action: Show a badass human ranger-type with a sword and leather armor. In his other hand he is holding a lyre or some type of stringed instrument.  

Maybe there's a huge mammoth or wurm behind him, filling the frame.  

This guy is a unique character in *Magic*, so feel free to make him distinct in his costuming starting at a base fantasy ranger/bard and elaborating from there.  

Focus: The warrior musician.  

Mood: "I shall compose a verse for your funeral."
