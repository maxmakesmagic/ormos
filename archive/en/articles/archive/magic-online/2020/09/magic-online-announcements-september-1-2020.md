Supreme Draft: *Modern Horizons*
--------------------------------


[As announced last week](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/introducing-supreme-draft-2020-08-24), we're running a series of Draft events in a new format dubbed Supreme Draft, the second of which begins tomorrow, September 2, and ends September 9. Fan-favorite high-synergy format *Modern Horizons* is returning for a week to Supreme Draft. You'll get the first and second picks from eighteen packs of that set. The set already encouraged you to chase dreams, but this event will be a unique opportunity to achieve them.


Entry options include 10 Event Tickets or 100 Play Points, and events are Phantom.

Showcase Opens September 5–6
----------------------------


The penultimate events of each season, Showcase Opens allow anyone to try their hand at earning an invitation to the Showcase. Players don't need to earn points or another qualification to enter, and because these events are Sealed, players don't even need a deck. The winner of each Open will get an invitation to the Showcase, while the runner up will earn an invitation to an upcoming Players Tour Series event. Entry options include 50 Event Tickets or 500 Play Points, and events consist of Swiss pairings followed by a single-elimination Top 8 draft.


Showcase Opens are scheduled as follows:





| **DATE** | **TIME** | **FORMAT** | **INVITATION** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Saturday, September 5, 2020 | 7:00 a.m. | 2XM Sealed | Season 2 Showcase |
| Sunday, September 6, 2020 | 7:00 a.m. | 2XM Sealed | Season 2 Showcase |
