Due to regulations in China, alternate art often needs to be produced for cards depicting the "undead." Below is another example. The top card is the normal version of *Seventh Edition* 
[Scathe Zombies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scathe+Zombies), and the bottom one is the Asian market version.

When the Asian market artwork was leaked prior to *Seventh Edition*'s release, many players incorrectly speculated that [Portcullis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Portcullis) was being reprinted.
