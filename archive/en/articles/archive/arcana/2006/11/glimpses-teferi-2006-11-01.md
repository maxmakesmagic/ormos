We took a look at the characteristic look of Teferi [back in 2004](/en/articles/archive/teferis-appearance-2004-12-15), but since he’s now a [Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Teferi%252C%2BMage%2Bof%2BZhalfir), it’s worth taking another look.


Can you name these cards by their Teferi-involving art?

Teferi and Urza team up to close the Phyrexian portal on [Disrupt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupt).

Teferi counters a spell on the “Spite” half of [Spite // Malice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spite+%2F%2F+Malice).

Yep, that’s Teferi in there. In this scene, the artificer Jhoira looks on as Teferi becomes trapped in a “slow time” bubble, as seen on [Slow Motion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slow+Motion).

Teferi “washes out” some kavu. See him in the background on the left?

Teferi at age 10! Teferi’s the mischievous student on the left, getting reprimanded by his teacher. He was always a plucky lad.


And then there’s Teferi today, after the events of *Time Spiral*:
