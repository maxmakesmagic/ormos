Keeping Up

 Mike Cannon started writing From the Lab at the end of 2012 after two years with GatheringMagic. He is an ardent casual player and loves finding uses for bad cards. 






You never know where your inspiration is going to come from. This week, I was looking through the cards being reprinted in *From the Vault: Annihilation* when one in particular stood out to me. [Smokestack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokestack) has been around for a long time, and has frequently made appearances in tournament decks. However, the card has mostly been used on its own, depriving both players of resources. I decided to try to skew things in my favor a little.

Smoke and Haze



Longtime readers of this column are well aware of my love for [Paradox Haze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradox+Haze). It's already appeared in three separate articles I've written, but this time I'm doing something a bit different. You see, [Paradox Haze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradox+Haze) isn't just a way for you to get an extra upkeep every turn. You can also choose to enchant your opponent. Then he or she will get an extra upkeep each turn, while you stick to just one.



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Paradox%20Haze)

That's where [Smokestack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokestack) comes in. Although you'll be forced to sacrifice an increasing number of permanents each turn, your opponent will have to sacrifice twice as many. Add that to the traditional exploit of stacking the triggers so you add a counter after you've already sacrificed your permanents, and you can completely shatter the symmetry of the effect. On your first upkeep, you'll sacrifice no permanents. Then your opponent will sacrifice two. You'll have to ditch one thing next turn while your opponent will lose four, and so on. If you can feed the [Smokestack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokestack) for just a few turns before sacrificing it you can obliterate your opponent's entire battlefield.



There are other cards that can be used to similar effect. [Braids, Cabal Minion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Cabal+Minion) will annihilate permanents, although not quite as well as [Smokestack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokestack). [Sunken Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunken+Hope) only hits creatures, but it will usually keep your opponent from being able to attack while not affecting you at all.





![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Braids,%20Cabal%20Minion)


![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sunken%20Hope)










[Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), and [Impulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Impulse) can dig through your library to find the cards you need, whether that be [Paradox Haze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradox+Haze), [Smokestack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokestack), or just more lands. I've also included [Rune Snag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag) and [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) to help stop your opponent from disrupting your plans. Although paying two or three extra mana is normally something your opponent can work around, [Smokestack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokestack) and Braids turn it into a nearly impossible task.



But wait, the deck is still missing one thing: A win condition. Although attacking with [Braids, Cabal Minion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Cabal+Minion) could work, that would mean you'd have to keep sacrificing permanents every turn. Instead, I've chosen to go with [Abyssal Persecutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abyssal+Persecutor). It can end the game quickly, even if your opponent still has a creature or two to block with. Once your opponent is below 0 life, the same cards you use to cripple your opponent can get rid of the Demon so you win the game.

All or Nothing



With upkeeps on the mind, it wasn't long before I turned to a quirky card I've been meaning to take proper advantage of. Whereas [Paradox Haze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradox+Haze) gives you or your opponent extra upkeeps, [Eon Hub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eon+Hub) eliminates them. When I first encountered the card shortly after *Coldsnap* was released, I used it to eliminate cumulative upkeep costs on large creatures. Today, I'll still be getting rid of cumulative upkeep, but I have something better than large creatures in mind.



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Eon%20Hub)

[Glacial Chasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Chasm) has a game-breaking ability. Simply play it and sacrifice a land, and you won't take damage for the rest of the game. The only reason the card isn't completely broken is its cumulative upkeep cost. You have to pay an increasing amount of life each turn to keep it around. Fortunately, [Eon Hub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eon+Hub) gets rid of that drawback quite nicely, making you nearly invincible.



Your opponent could still get rid of [Eon Hub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eon+Hub) with a card like [Banishing Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light). However, another cumulative upkeep card can take care of that problem. [Ritual of Subdual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ritual+of+Subdual) makes all lands produce colorless mana, which means your opponent won't be able to cast most spells without help from other mana sources, which he or she may not have access to at all.





![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Glacial%20Chasm)


![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ritual%20of%20Subdual)










Once you have [Ritual of Subdual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ritual+of+Subdual) on the battlefield, you don't really need to cast any colored spells. [Eon Hub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eon+Hub) is colorless, [Glacial Chasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Chasm) is a land, and I've included a pair of artifacts as win conditions. [Sands of Delirium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sands+of+Delirium) can quickly get rid of all the cards in your opponent's deck, while [Rod of Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rod+of+Ruin) provides a slow and painful death at the hands of a card that's rarely playable in anything ever.



[Enlightened Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor) searches your library for the cards you need, and I've also included a variety of mana-producing cards to help you reach the five mana for [Eon Hub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eon+Hub) more quickly. They also have the benefit of allowing you to cast [Enlightened Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor) while under the effects of [Ritual of Subdual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ritual+of+Subdual). Avacyn's Pilgrim and [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) can serve as blockers if needed, and [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl) has a net cost of nothing if you tap the enchanted land that same turn. [Coalition Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Relic) is slower, but can give you two extra mana at once, allowing you to cast [Eon Hub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eon+Hub) or [Ritual of Subdual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ritual+of+Subdual) two turns earlier than you would otherwise be able to.

Let's Do That Again!



I wanted to continue with the upkeep theme, so I decided to look for some potential combo cards involving upkeeps. One oddball card I particularly like but have never written about is [Timesifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timesifter). The card could easily allow you to take an unlimited number of turns and make sure you always win the converted mana cost war. However, it's set up to make that difficult. By exiling both cards, [Timesifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timesifter) makes it much more difficult to fix the outcome.



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Timesifter)

That isn't to say it's impossible. In *Magic*, few things are. My first thought was to use [Misthollow Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misthollow+Griffin). Cast it from exile and, if you can put it back on top of your library you're good to go for next turn. However, that would most likely require the services of [Sunscape Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Apprentice), and I just used that card recently.



So if you can't use the same card over and over, why not just make sure every card has a high converted mana cost? And thus was born one of the most unusual decks I've ever written about.



Here's the plan: Fill the deck with really expensive creatures that have morph. Doesn't matter what they are, because you will never cast them or turn them face up. Once you hit five lands, cast [Mana Severance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance) to get rid of the rest of them. Whether you cast [Timesifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timesifter) before or after, the next time it triggers it should exile a morph creature that costs at least eight mana, giving you the next turn. As you take all the turns thanks to a deck full of expensive things, you can cast creatures face down until you win the game with an army of 2/2s.



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mana%20Severance)

We'll need some way to find the key cards, so [Fabricate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate) is in to tutor up [Timesifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timesifter). [Mystical Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor) grabs [Mana Severance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance), and can even search for [Fabricate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate) to search for [Timesifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timesifter) if need be. Unfortunately, using these means you might lose a [Timesifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timesifter) war every once in a while, but assuming that five mana will usually be enough to win against most cards your opponent has, you'll be taking at least two or three turns. The least expensive cards in your deck still beat out the lands in your opponent's, so you'll likely win even more often.



Despite a variety of colors in the morph creatures, the deck only really needs blue to function. That means I had room to throw in [Halimar Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths), which can help you move a land closer to the top or even do a bit of digging for the combo pieces. Normally, the ability leaves you stuck with cards you don't want on top of your library, but in addition to [Fabricate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate), [Mana Severance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance), and [Mystical Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor), I've added [Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest) and [Scalding Tarn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) to allow you to shuffle away unwanted cards.

At the End of the Beginning



When I started writing this article I had no idea where inspiration would take me. What started with a particular card in *From the Vault: Annihilation* led to the exploration of a single step in the turn. But the upkeep is only the beginning. If you'd like to see me take a look at some of the other steps and phases in *Magic*, or if you think it's a terrible idea, let me know through my Twitter account ([@MTGCannon](https://twitter.com/@MTGCannon)) or by sending an email to [MTGCannon@gmail.com](mailto:MTGCannon@gmail.com). Either way, join me next week when we'll look to the past to learn more about the future. See ya!
