Historic Brawl Festival
=======================


![Brawl](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/nov_sog_brawl_768.png)


The artificers of Kaladesh know how to blend the natural and the crafted, the new and the old, to create something truly unique and amazing. Here at the Inventors' Fair, all manner of masterworks are exhibited for the world to see. What sparkling jewel will inspire your next creation? What unexpected or forgotten item will bring your invention together perfectly? If you can imagine it, you can find it here. Bring a Brawl deck using any cards on *MTG Arena* - not just Standard! Change it at any time during the event.
