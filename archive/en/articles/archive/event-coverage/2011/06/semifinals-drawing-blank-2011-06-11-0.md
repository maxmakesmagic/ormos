Toshiyuki Kadooka vs. Elie Pichon
---------------------------------


There was silence as the two shuffled up for their semifinal match. Toshiyuki Kadooka, fresh off defeating Luis Scott-Vargas in four games, was playing a three-color controllish deck featuring abundant card advantage. Elie Pichon, who had similarly dispatched Pat Cox in the quarters, was piloting an aggressive red-white deck.

### Game 1


Things looked grim from the start for Pichon. He had to mulligan down to five, while Kadooka started with a full grip. He stared at two [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) while Kadooka spilled out [Viridian Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Emissary), [Neurok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Replica), [Trigon of Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trigon+of+Corruption), then [Cystbearer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cystbearer) and [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite). A third [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) was no help. Pichon continued to block with his face, and they were soon onto Game 2.

Kadooka 1, Pichon 0


### Game 2


Pichon chose to play again in Game 2 two, and even got to start with a full grip. He started off with [Embersmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embersmith) and then [Porcelain Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire), though he had to pay 2 life as he was stuck on just a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). Kadooka spent a [Grasp of Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Darkness) on it at end of turn.


Kadooka quickly untapped and played [Vedalken Anatomist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Anatomist). Pichon found a second [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) waiting for him on top of his deck and considered his options. He hit for 2 and played a second [Embersmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embersmith). Kadooka untapped and killed off one of them with his [Vedalken Anatomist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Anatomist).


Pichon hit for 2 more, leaving Kadooka at 14, but could only add a frail [Vulshok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) to his board. Kadooka played his fifth land and sent that to the bin. A fourth land for Pichon, and with it a [Slash Panther](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slash+Panther). Kadooka took 6. On his turn he played out [Ezuri's Archers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%27s+Archers), readying his Anatomist.


On Pichon's turn he locked down the Panther and pushed his Archers in front of the [Embersmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embersmith). A [Mutagenic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth) from Pichon made the save. Pichon then summoned [Leonin Skyhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter) and passed the turn.

Kadooka played a land and passed it right back. Inside the combat phase, the Anatomist killed off the [Embersmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embersmith) and [Slice in Twain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+in+Twain) dispatched the [Slash Panther](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slash+Panther). The Skyhunter put Kadooka to 6. Pichon summoned [Blade-Tribe Berserkers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade-Tribe+Berserkers). Eight mana for Kadooka meant he could summon [Pestilent Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilent+Souleater) and still keep the Skyhunter from attacking with the Anatomist. He did so, and Pichon declined to attack with his [Berserk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk)ers.


On his next turn, Kadooka put the final nail in the coffin: [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage), searching up [Thopter Assembly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Assembly), then playing it. Pichon had no immediate answer. [Viridian Claw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Claw) wasn't exactly what the doctor ordered. Another blank draw, and Pichon was scooping up his cards.


Kadooka 2, Pichon 0


### Game 3


Pichon had turn-two [Porcelain Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire) to start. Kadooka had [Ezuri's Archers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%27s+Archers) and then [Viridian Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Emissary), and was happy to chump the incoming Legionnaire to accelerate his mana. Pichon had nothing to do on three mana, but four gave him a [Slash Panther](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slash+Panther) to join the Legionnaire in the attack. Kadooka tapped four for [Slice in Twain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+in+Twain), killing the Legionnaire.


Kadooka untapped and further cluttered the board with [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage) (no prizes for guessing what he tutored for) and another [Viridian Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Emissary). Pichon's response was an anemic [Leonin Skyhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter). The Assembly hit the battlefield. Pichon sent it away for a turn with [Banishment Decree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishment+Decree), and traded his Skyhunter for Kadooka's Archers.

Kadooka kept on the Assembly plan. Pichon shrugged and played [Metallic Mastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metallic+Mastery), getting in 5 damage but unable to sacrifice the Assembly. Kadooka got his squad of tokens and swung for 4 with his [Viridian Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Emissary) and [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage). Pichon took the damage and watched the [Thopter Assembly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Assembly) hit play yet again.


Pichon drew, played his seventh land, and shook his head. He passed the turn. Kadooka decided to spoil any surprises with [Entomber Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomber+Exarch) on Pichon's hand. Pichon [Artillerize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artillerize)d the Assembly in response, but it was a Pyrrhic victory. He had just [Kuldotha Ringleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Ringleader) left in hand. He checked his top card, and then extended his hand in congratulations to Kadooka, drawing a huge cheer from the Japanese spectators.
