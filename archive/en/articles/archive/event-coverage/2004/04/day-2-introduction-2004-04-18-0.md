Welcome to Day Two of our live coverage of Grand Prix DC!


One Hundred and Seventy One teams got to sleep in this morning while the Top 20 from yesterday's grueling eight rounds plunged into the relatively uncharted waters of *Mirrodin* Team Rochester Draft.


Zabutan Nemonaut featuring Mike Turian, Gary Wise, and Eugene Harvey was an early favorite to duplicate the success they found earlier this Pro Tour season in Boston. The two TOGIT teams and the Your Move Games/Illuminati squads also looked like reasonable picks to earn some dollars. Alex Shvartsman, Rob Dougherty, and Darwin Kastle made up the only undefeated team on Day One and only need to secure one win to make the Top 4.


DG in DC is made up of Craig Krempels, Gerard Fabiano, and Jon Sonne. They squeaked in as the last team to need a wake up call this morning. The stars need to align for them to advance to the Top 4 but the other TOGIT team Shenanigans with Osyp Lebedowicz, Patrick Sullivan and Adam Horvath were in much better position with a 7-1 record yesterday.


There were a number of surprising faces playing on Day Two. Not surprising based on their past history--just how far back in history some of them went. While Chris Pikula's team did not fare well yesterday Steve O'Mahoney-Schwartz, his brother Dan, and "Mouth" Kambourakis--playing as Word of Mouth--posted a 7-1 record. Jon Finkel--rarely seen at a Grand Prix these days--also posted a 7-1 record with the aid of Brian Kibler and Eric Froelich playing as the politically charged Re-Elect Gore. 


Ben Stark, Antonino DeRosa, and Rich Hoaen as [www.westcoastgames.com](http://www.westcoastgames.com) as well as Kyle Rose, Morgan Douglass, and Phil Freneau as the Aristocrats were also playing today so the race for the Top 4 remains too close to call. Stay tuned to all the action from the nation's Capitol as we sort it all out and elect a Grand Prix champion.
