![Scragnoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scragnoth)Here's a rules question for you. Can you use [Dragon Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Blood) to put a +1/+1 counter on [Scragnoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scragnoth)? After all, it says it can't be countered. :)
 But seriously, this card is the oldest card I ever designed. It wasn't the first card of mine to see print (that would be [Gustha's Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustha%27s+Scepter) in *Alliances*), but it was the card I designed the earliest to ever see print. Since then it's been my goal to get “cannot be countered” on more cards. I got a bunch into *Invasion*. And now one even made it to *Eighth Edition*. 


All this for a little card that started life named [Greased Weasel](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-weasel).
