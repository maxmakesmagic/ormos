Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com).

**Q: When can we expect a Planeswalker's Guide for *Dragon's Maze?***  


**A: Trick Jarrett, DailyMTG.com Editor-in-Chief & DailyMTGCast Host**


The short answer is that you shouldn't.


We discussed the possibility of doing one, but we weren't able to come up with how it would differ from those we did about the guilds for *Return to Ravnica* and *Gatecrash*. One idea was to focus on the story, but that takes away from the awesome work that Doug has been doing with *The Secretist*. If you haven't read them yet, you should definitely check them out. Part Three is scheduled to release May 21, 2013. You can buy [Part One](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/223c) and [Part Two](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/236) from your favorite e-book retailer, such as [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=the+secretist+doug+beyer&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Athe+secretist+doug+beyer%20), [Google](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=the+secretist&c=books), or [Barnes & Noble](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/the-secretist?store=allproducts&keyword=the+secretist).
