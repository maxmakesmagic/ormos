Today the [*Time Spiral* minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/timespiral/home) updates with more exclusive goodies about the set. What’s the deal with the word “time” in the set’s title? What’s with the mash-up of Then and Now? The minisite gets into specifics and provides some more exclusive art previews featuring graphic expressions of some seriously messed-up timelines.


There’s also two more installments of the *Antiquities* comic, detailing part of the story of the brothers Urza and Mishra—particularly relevant given [Chris Millar’s card preview](/en/articles/archive/captain-industry-2006-09-06) today.


There’s *also* a puzzle to do, so you can reveal some amazing *Time Spiral* art to yourself as quickly or slowly as you can stand. So [what are you waiting for](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/timespiral/home)?
