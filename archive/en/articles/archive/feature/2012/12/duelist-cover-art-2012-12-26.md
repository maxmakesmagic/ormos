*This Arcana originally appeared on October 18, 2012.*


Two weeks ago, we [showed you the winners](/en/articles/archive/coloring-contest-winners-2012-10-05) of the PAX Prime Coloring Contest. But we didn't show you the whole coloring book!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1084_cover.jpg)The art was created by Mike "Gabriel" Krahulik from [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com). And it came with these neat **Magic**-themed crayons!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1084_crayons.jpg)Incidentally, the crayon "Violet Ultimatum" was named by Monty Ashley, who is also the person who's writing this Arcana. That isn't important; I just wanted to mention it because it's a pretty good pun and I'm proud of it.


Anyway! Mike Krahulik did eight Planeswalkers, and now we're going to show them to you! Click on each thumbnail to get a life-size page, suitable for printing and coloring in at home.
