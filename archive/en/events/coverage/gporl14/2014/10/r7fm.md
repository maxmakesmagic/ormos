While the *Magic Online* Community Cup put him onto our [Twitch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twitch).tv screens everywhere recently, it hasn't been since his runner-up finish at Grand Prix Houston last year Tom Ross has been in the premier *Magic* spotlight. With a Pro Tour Top 8 from Honolulu in 2009 and another Grand Prix Top 8 shortly before that, is might seem as though Ross hasn't been playing competitive *Magic* recently.


Looking along the scoreboards of StarCityGames' Open Series tells a different tale.


Ross has been playing plenty of *Magic*, and doing quite well holding his own among the top performers on the Open Series. Thanks to near-weekly tournaments all across the US, Ross has only cemented his skills practicing Constructed formats. Grand Prix Houston, if you check back, was a Limited event.


Skill is like a blade, and Ross was keeping his sharp in all directions.


Of course, repeating a deep run this weekend was a long way off. Kevin Zhao, one of the many trying their hands at *Khans of Tarkir* Sealed this weekend was standing in the way. Coming into the round each player had a draw, which is often as bad as a lass: Only players with 21 or more points can return for Day 2, and earning just one through a draw doesn't help one get there.


For both players losing this match would be just like losing a second game, setting them into the path where no more losses were possible.



**The Decks**



Both players brought four-color decks to bear. Ross was firmly Abzan, with powerful monsters such as Ivorytust Fortress, [High Sentinels of Arashin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Sentinels+of+Arashin), and [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer) to work with, backed up by a splash of blue for [Sagu Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sagu+Mauler). Two copies each of [Savage Punch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Punch) and [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury) rounded out a redundant removal package for Ross.


Zhao, too, packed a copy of [High Sentinels of Arashin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Sentinels+of+Arashin), but white was his splash color. With the dash of white to support [Flying Crane Technique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Crane+Technique) as well, Zhao brought the ferocity of the Temur with him: Bear's Companion, [Winterflame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winterflame), and some Jeskai converts in [Riverwheel Aerialists](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riverwheel+Aerialists) and two copies of [Mystic of the Hidden Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+of+the+Hidden+Way). With the ability to punch damage through and overrun through the air, Zhao's removal was fewer in number but mattered much more for him.



**The Games**



Zhao led with an early [Temur Charger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Charger), clocking Ross repeatedly as the Community Cup champion assembled a morph to pair with [Ghostfire Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostfire+Blade). [Mystic of the Hidden Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+of+the+Hidden+Way) was Zhao's mystery revealed, putting Ross to just 10 life.





*Tom Ross battled from behind to take the first game.*
