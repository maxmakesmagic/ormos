This is no joke, we're releasing the first part of the *Theros* story in eBook novella form on April 1, 2014, rather than the previously announced date of April 22, 2014!


> *On Theros, Elspeth hopes the gods will keep her safe from the evils of the Multiverse. But the powerful planeswalker comes to the attention of the sun god, Heliod, who believes she is destined to be his champion. As the gods quarrel with each other, Elspeth must face a massive hydra that was unleashed from the realm of the gods.*
