PACKING THE MAGIC SUITCASE
==========================

Over the last few weeks, my Facebook feed has been full of players cataloging their assorted travels. Orlando, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Stockholm, Chile...one of the less obvious skillsets of the global *Magic* Pro is the ability to travel well, and often. Like anyone trying to pack their functional lives into a single suitcase, players have to juggle all the utterly mundane items that are so easily forgotten (toothbrush, plasters, deodorant, socks?) with the ones that are heart-stoppingly terrible if you somehow manage to start your travel without them (passport, money, Taylor Swift's new album). *Magic* players have one added layer of complexity over the regular population, and that's encapsulated in the word *Constructed*. See, cards – at least the versions that aren't on *Magic Online* – have an actual, real-world weight to them. Airlines don't like heavy luggage, and they discourage this by super-expensive penalties for suitcases that don't fit the bill.

And yet, you are about to travel to three continents to play Standard, you're not going home in between, you don't know what the Standard metagame looks like, and you have only a very little room left in your precious suitcase. So, when you're sitting at home, desperately making lists of all the things you forgot last time that you need to remember this time, what cards need to be with you? Thankfully, Standard has only five sets in it right now – *Theros*, *Born of the Gods*, *Journey into Nyx*, *Magic 2015*, and *Khans of Tarkir*. Now that we have information from the Pro Tour in Honolulu, plus Standard Grand Prix in Los Angeles and Stockholm, what should the perfect MTG suitcase contain for players coming to Chile this weekend? Let's wade through the cupboards, and see which cards are coming to South America...



*Theros*


White – [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) is getting played a bunch. Almost any Planeswalker makes the cut, so that means [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion). [Glare of Heresy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Heresy) is a useful Sideboard card. Then there's stuff for the Blue-White Heroic deck. Do we really want to be bringing cards like [Ordeal of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod), [Favored Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite), and [Gods Willing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing)? I'm not sure we do, unless we're being super-completist. To my surprise, it looks like I won't be needing [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon), which was a real Standard staple.


Blue – [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) is an easy choice. [Prognostic Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx) belongs in Blue-Black Control. I don't feel we need to look at old school Blue Devotion, so [Master of Waves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) and [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) both get to stay home.


Black – A few months ago, both [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) and [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) would have been packing their bags automatically. Now, it's just the Downfall that needs the sunscreen. [Pharika's Cure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure) has been showing up in some Sideboards, and so has [Read the Bones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones). Then there's [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), and [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos), both of which are major players right now.




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thoughtseize)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=THOUGHTSEIZE)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=WHIP%20OF%20EREBOS)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=WHIP%20OF%20EREBOS)





Red – [Akroan Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Crusader) now has a home in Standard, while [Anger of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods) has always been real. Proving that cheap is often good, [Coordinated Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coordinated+Assault) needs a space, as does [Dragon Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle). Burn spells [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) and [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) are certainties, as are [Titan's Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titan%27s+Strength) and [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon). *Theros* Red has a lot going on.


Green – [Arbor Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus) has been showing up in small numbers. Brian Kibler popularized [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr). [Commune with the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commune+with+the+Gods) has been consistently filling graveyards in recent weeks. Then there's devotion stuff, like [Nylea, God of the Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%2C+God+of+the+Hunt), and [Nylea's Disciple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple). [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) is still huge, and mana accelerators [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) and [Voyaging Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr) continue to power out threats.


Gold – I guess we could bring [Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver). [Destructive Revelry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Revelry) is seeing Sideboard play. [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) hasn't seen a ton of play, but is still very good. If we want to go deep (like Mikael Magnusson in Stockholm) we want to take [Steam Augury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Augury) too. As for [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler), it's hard to imagine leaving any Planeswalker back at home.


Land – And this is where we get punished on weight. Do we want [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx)? Yes. And all five Temples? Sure. That's 24 cards right there. Ho hum.


So, with one set down and four to go, we're committing to something like 37 cards. That doesn't sound like a lot, but multiply it by four and we have 148 cards – that's already two complete decks plus sideboards. And we still have four sets to go. Fortunately, though, the next one up is *Born of the Gods*, and I'm not sure we're going to find huge pressure on our suitcase. Let's see:


[Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) is the only White card we need on the plane. I suppose we could take possibly-useful things like [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) and [Nullify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nullify), and if we're thinking about [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) Combo, we'll be needing [Retraction Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retraction+Helix). Black gives us mass removal of sorts in both [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) (don't forget to kill your own [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) so that you can kill theirs!) and [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow). [Herald of Torment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Torment) has also been showing up. [Scouring Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scouring+Sands) is also a marginal card, while Red also gives us the rock-solid [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood). Green brings us arguably the most influential card in Standard – [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) – and we also need room for [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) and [Unravel the Æther](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unravel+the+%C3%86ther), which is popular in Sideboards. None of the Gods make it in, but the unlikely [Astral Cornucopia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Cornucopia) does, for the Ascendancy Combo deck. Finally, we have the Temples, and four more copies of each.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bile%20Blight)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=BILE%20BLIGHT)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=COURSER%20OF%20KRUPHIX)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=COURSER%20OF%20KRUPHIX)





Actually, *Born of the Gods* had more goodies than I was expecting. 14 cards, or 56 total, bringing our total to 204. Let's finish off the block with *Journey into Nyx*:


White gets us going with [Banishing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light) and [Nyx-Fleece Ram](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyx-Fleece+Ram). We could also make the case for [Deicide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deicide), as there are a lot of nasty Enchantments running around in Standard. What I can't make a case for is any Blue cards – there just aren't any worth the space. Black has [Brain Maggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Maggot), and it also has one of the massive players in the format, [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant). Red has some Sideboard options – [Blinding Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Flare) gets Strive into Standard, while [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel) really isn't taking prisoners. [Magma Spray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Spray) makes the cut, and then we have another choice over the incredibly niche [Riddle of Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddle+of+Lightning), which does quite naughty things with Dig through Time. If we're taking [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant), we're certainly taking another key component of that deck, [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms).




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=DOOMWAKE%20GIANT)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=DOOMWAKE%20GIANT)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=EIDOLON%20OF%20BLOSSOMS)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=EIDOLON%20OF%20BLOSSOMS)





Once we're into the Gold cards, [Ajani, Mentor of Heroes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Mentor+of+Heroes) gets to come, and the Gods get a look in here, with [Keranos, God of Storms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keranos%2C+God+of+Storms), [Pharika, God of Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%2C+God+of+Affliction), and [Kruphix, God of Horizons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kruphix%2C+God+of+Horizons) all justifying their place. A new addition might be [Nyx Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyx+Weaver), which certainly wasn't a big deal at the start of the Standard season, but is starting to see more play now. Once again, the lands are automatic includes, with four [Mana Confluence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Confluence) to go with the remaining temples.


That's 16 different cards, or 64 total, bringing our overall suitcase to 268. Now I'm getting nervous, because although we've packed three sets away and only have two more to sift through, I have a feeling they're going to be huge. First, *Magic 2015*:


Maybe I shouldn't have worried. White has [Ajani Steadfast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Steadfast) and I've-seen-a-list-with-it-somewhere [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros). It's a strange world where [Jace, the Living Guildpact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Living+Guildpact) doesn't get in, and [Jorubai Murk Lurker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jorubai+Murk+Lurker) does, but that's where we are, while [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) is always going to make it into any MTG suitcase. [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) and [Soul of Innistrad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Innistrad) are the contributions from Black. [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster) sees play mostly out of Sideboards, proving that the best class of permanents don't always make the best decks. After all, both [Foundry Street Denizen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foundry+Street+Denizen) and [Frenzied Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenzied+Goblin) are making their mark all over game one. You also get [Hammerhand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammerhand) from Red, and, of course, one of the biggest players in the format, [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster). There's also spot-on removal in [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames). That's a major contribution from Red.




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin%20Rabblemaster)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=GOBLIN%20RABBLEMASTER)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hammerhand)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=HAMMERHAND)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stoke%20the%20Flames)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=STOKE%20THE%20FLAMES)





As for Green, this might be the weekend when we see [Back to Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Back+to+Nature) seeing some play. [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) is a format staple, as is [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen). [Hornet Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Nest) isn't as popular, but is still in some Sideboards. [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker) also gets a spot, and we're starting to see [Reclamation Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclamation+Sage) appearing. Also getting a mention is an Artifact, which might be the first time we've needed one – it's [Perilous Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Vault), central to the Blue-Black control plan played by Owen Turtenwald in Honolulu and Los Angeles. We round the set out with all the pain lands – [Battlefield Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Forge), [Caves of Koilos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caves+of+Koilos), [Llanowar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Wastes), [Shivan Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), [Yavimaya Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Coast), and the extremely useful [Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg%2C+Tomb+of+Yawgmoth).


Huh. I guess it did gather momentum once we were passed White. There are 26 cards there, or 104 total, bringing us up to 372. That's almost exactly the equivalent of five entire decks plus sideboard, and we still have one set to go. Here comes the avalanche of goodies from *Khans of Tarkir*:


We start with [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities). I just can't bring myself to leave the format [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) at home. Then there's [Erase](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erase), [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way), [Suspension Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suspension+Field), and the totally awesome (though not utterly dominant) [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) starts us off in Blue, followed by [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke). As a finisher, [Pearl Lake Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pearl+Lake+Ancient) is very tough to beat. In Black, [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut) does indeed make the cut, but that's all. Red gives us [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix), and the Temur-aligned [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws). Mono-Red also gets [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) (which from Spanish translates as 'Attack of the Mini-Horde!), and [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear), plus the poster Planeswalker, [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker). In Green, we have Heir of the Wild, [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic), and [See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten).




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dig%20Through%20Time)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=DIG%20THROUGH%20TIME)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crater's%20Claws)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=CRATER'S%20CLAWS)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=SEE%20THE%20UNWRITTEN)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=SEE%20THE%20UNWRITTEN)





Unsurprisingly, this isn't where the true strength of *Khans* lies. For that we want Gold, and the Clans. There are close to twenty cards that we should add to our burgeoning travel pile – In Abzan, there's the [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm), plus [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost), and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). Jeskai has the charm (they all do), plus [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) and [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) (if we think that's worth persevering with). [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) and [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom) are the stars for Mardu, while [Savage Knuckleblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Knuckleblade) is the Temur standout. [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant) headlines for the Sultai, with a nod to [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth). Then there are the two-color cards, like [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer), [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor), [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End), and [Sagu Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sagu+Mauler).


Phew, we're done! Oh wait – lands! [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare)! That's 10 common lands, 10 uncommon lands, and 5 rare lands, and we want them all. That's 100 cards right there. In total, there are 60 *Khans of Tarkir* cards we want in our *Magic* suitcase, and that means 240 total cards, giving us a grand total of 612.


So how does it all shape up?


600 cards is the equivalent of eight complete decks with sideboard. That's oddly comforting, since we could certainly imagine building a version of eight decks, something like:


Jeskai Ascendancy Combo Jeskai  

Mardu Midrange  

Sidisi-Whip  

Blue-Black Control  

Boss Sligh  

Abzan Control  

Temur Monsters


There's no doubt that this lot is going to be heavy, and of course we're never going to play most of them. However, we'll travel happier knowing that we have access to everything we need for this week's Standard. So, next time you've got a month of travel across three continents ahead of you, don't forget to pack your *Magic*suitcase!
