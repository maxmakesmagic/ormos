The availability and timing of select *Strixhaven: School of Mages* products are revised for the following locations:


**Australia, New Zealand, and Thailand**


Unfortunately, due to shipment delays, the *Strixhaven: School of Mages* Prerelease will now be combined with the release date of April 23. Prerelease events and all other *Strixhaven: School of Mages* products will be available beginning that day.


Additionally, for Thailand, *Strixhaven: School of Mages* Bundles will release approximately mid-May.


**United States and Canada**


Due to unexpected production issues, some *Strixhaven: School of Mages* Draft Boosters and Japanese-language Set Boosters will be delayed. These products are not limited releases, and we are working toward making more available after release on April 23.

We're excited to share *Strixhaven: School to Mages* soon. Thank you for your understanding as we work to supply fans and stores as soon as possible.
