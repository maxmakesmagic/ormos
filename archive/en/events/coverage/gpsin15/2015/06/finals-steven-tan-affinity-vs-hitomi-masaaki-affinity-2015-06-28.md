Judging from the results of Grand Prix Charlotte and Grand Prix Copenhagen, who would have expected an all-Affinity mirror match in the finals amidst a sea of unfair combo decks and midrange decks laden with hate?


The last two men standing at Grand Prix Singapore are both armed with the explosive beatdown deck, spearheaded by [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating), [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion), [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) and an assortment of cheap artifacts.





[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dispatch)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispatch)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Galvanic+Blast)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast)
Despite largely similar maindecks, the main difference between both decks was the choice of removal. Tan went with a pair of [Dispatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispatch), while Masaaki went with a quad of [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast). Despite that, it could be anyone's game!


Game One
========


After a mulligan, Tan led with [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge), Memnite and Ornithopher. Kawasaki was not to be outdone, using [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), [Darksteel Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel) and double [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) to power out a turn 1 [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion).


Tan tried to negate the damage that [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) would deal by summoning a second and third [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) but Masaaki had the [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) to upset the combat math.


Tan still had a chance to recover if he was allowed to untap with [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer). That could grow his trio of [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge)s into 2/2 lifelinkers. And into 3/3 lifelinkers. And then 4/4 lifelinkers.


However, one can only hope.


Masaaki was ready with [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) to throw that plan out of the window. When Tan tried to chump with both his [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) on to successive turns, a second and third [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) put an end to the plan.


A second [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) and [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) was the final nail in the coffin for Tan.

Game Two
========


It is sometimes said that the Affinity deck mulligans often but mulligans well. Masaaki would have to disagree. Going down to four cards, he quickly faced pressure from [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) and [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer).


Masaaki did not have the [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) so Tan proceeded to summon [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) and put +1/+1 counters on his entire army.


Masaaki had [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) to kill both [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) and [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer). Regardless, Tan had the board advantage, backed up with [Dispatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispatch) and [Wear & Tear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+%2F%2F+Tear). It was certain that Masaaki could not recover from that ill-fated series of mulligans.

In under five minutes, Tan had forced the rubber game!

Game Three
==========


It seems like a reversal of fortunes would sculpt the final game. It was Tan who went down to five cards.


Kawasaki kickstarted with [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) and [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge).


On his turn three, [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) and [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) were melded as one. Thankfully for Tan, [Wear & Tear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+%2F%2F+Tear) made its dramatic appearance to buy him a little more time but was still facing a pair of [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest)s, Memnite, [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) and [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter).


When Tan added [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer) to the board, Kawasaki decimated his entire board with [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) and [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) (with flashback).


The Singaporean crowd winced and everyone knew it was over. Hitomi Masaaki had denied Singapore of yet another Grand Prix Trophy, bringing glory to Japan.
