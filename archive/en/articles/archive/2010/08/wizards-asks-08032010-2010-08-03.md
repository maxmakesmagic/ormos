*What's your favorite place to talk about **Magic**, and why?*

**Kelly Digges:** I spend a lot of my time talking about **Magic**, and when I'm not doing so at work because it's my job or at home with my fiancée, you'll most often find me on Twitter. I share the official @[dailymtg](https://twitter.com/dailymtg) Twitter feed with Monty Ashley (@[montykins](https://twitter.com/montykins)), and I also tweet occasionally on my personal feed, @[kellydigges](https://twitter.com/kellydigges). Although you can't get any really deep discussion going, you can follow **Magic** personalities directly, respond to whatever random questions and hashtags pop up out of the general mindstream (#badtemplates was a favorite of mine), and throw out interesting questions of your own if you want to. Whatever's happening right now, you're a part of it.


Of course, Twitter's immediacy is also its drawback; #badtemplates is close to impossible to dredge up now. I mean, that was like two months ago! Practically ancient history, as far as Twitter is concerned. It's all about the current obsession, whatever that happens to be. I enjoy that; others might not, and I respect that. (Others might also be sick of hearing about Twitter. To them I say: Sorry, but get used to it.)
