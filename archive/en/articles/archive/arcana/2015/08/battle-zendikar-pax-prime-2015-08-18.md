PAX Prime is quickly approaching, and *Magic* will be there in force! We're going to completely take over the Annex with epic panels, celebrity guests, exclusive previews, sweet swag giveaways, tons of chances to play *Magic*—oh, and a little thing we call the *Magic* World Championship will be happening at the same time. Mark your calendars: Friday, August 28 through Monday, August 31 is a major moment for the global *Magic* community, and you won't want to miss it!


All times listed below are Pacific (UTC -7), West Coast time in the United States.


BATTLE FOR ZENDIKAR PREVIEW SHOW
================================


Saturday, August 29, 7:30–8:30 p.m.


With *Battle for Zendikar* just around the corner, we are pulling out all the stops for our one-hour preview show. Don't have a pass to PAX Prime? No worries! We will also be live streaming the event via [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/magic). Now you have no excuse to miss it—not that you'd want to miss a second of this show! Hosted by Wil Wheaton and Ashly Burch, this show will feature fabulous celebrities and *Magic* personalities, exclusive looks at new cards and set mechanics, and heart-pounding previews of terrifying monsters and spectacular heroes.


Guys. It's gonna be epic.


BATTLE FOR ZENDIKAR
===================


Saturday, August 29, 4–7 p.m.


Before the preview show, you can join the battle and help save Zendikar from the Eldrazi! All afternoon, an army of celebrity Spellslingers—including Wil Wheaton, Felicia Day, the crew from LoadingReadyRun, and more—will be battling on the side of the Eldrazi. Challenge them to a duel in the name of the Zendikari and receive sweet prizes! Plus, our Spellslingers will be revealing preview cards throughout the day.

More experienced players can play in the Advanced Convention League, join in a throwback *Rise of the Eldrazi* draft, or hop into a *Magic Origins* draft. All of these events feature the legendary Prize Wall. Players can earn tickets through the various events and trade them in for sweet, sweet loot!


Are you excited for PAX? I'm excited for PAX. (I may or may not have a calendar with Xs marking off all the days leading up to this epic weekend.) Arm yourselves against the Eldrazi onslaught, join us on [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) and in the convention halls, and prepare to *Battle for Zendikar*!
