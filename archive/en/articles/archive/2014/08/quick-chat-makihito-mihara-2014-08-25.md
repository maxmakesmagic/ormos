Former World Champion (14) Makihito Mihara is possibly the most accomplished player in the room today. He has enjoyed a decent season, even if he professes that he isn't doing as well as he wants to be. 


Currently sitting at 31 Pro Points, he is all locked up for Gold next year but surely he can't be happy with "just" that. He is Hall of Famer calibre after all, and nothing less than Platinum is befitting of his status.


A couple of years back, he failed to make the ballot, possibly because his resume was not as impressive as the eventual inductees (Paulo Vitor Dama de Rosa, Masashi Oiso and Kenji Tsumura) but since then, he has added two more Pro Tour Top 8s in Year 2013 alone. This bumped him up to five Pro Tour Top 8s, a feat only 23 other players have matched or surpassed, and almost all of them are Hall of Famers already. Suddenly, seven Grand Prix Top 8s and two wins seems like icing on the cake. Let's just say it wouldn't surprise anyone if he was a hot favorite.





*Makihito Mihara speaks about his plans for the remaining half of the season.*
