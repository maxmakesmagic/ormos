Today's **Magic** Arcana takes a peek at the *Urza's Saga* Style Guide. A style guide is a document that aids **Magic** artists and authors by providing visual impressions of a particular block and setting. It also provides details of the history of a **Magic** world.


As we saw in an [earlier Arcana](/en/articles/archive/thran-symbol-2004-01-20), the Thran have a symbol that appears on a few cards. The same is true for the Phyrexians. Here are a few Yawgmoth-themed places you'll see the circle-and-vertical-bar symbol.
