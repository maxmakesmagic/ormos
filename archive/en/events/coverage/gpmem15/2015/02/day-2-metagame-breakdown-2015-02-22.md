 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit.

Like Seville, aggressive strategies like White-Red Aggro and Abzan Aggro are in abundance. What’s surprising, however, is the return of Jeskai to the top lines of the metagame breakdown. Excluding Jeskai Tokens and [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) – the combo deck build around the namesake enchantment – the Jeskai decks filling out the field here are essentially White-Red Aggro decks that didn’t give up access to [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) and [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise).


Two other surprising leaps are Red-Green Devotion and Abzan Control. Red-Green Devotion are built on the Green Devotion backbone, with [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) hanging out in the lands section, but play both green and red threats. [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) dodges the abundance of removal like [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance), [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks), and [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm), and powering out tons of mana makes Crater’s Claws as good as [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) gets.



 Abzan Control is just like it sounds: Instead of [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and most other bodies in the main deck – [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) just won’t go away, of course! – it plays *all* the removal spells in the colors. With [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities) or [Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast) (Or both!) to turn back the battlefield, it takes control without ever countering a spell. Some competitors brought a metagame play in the sideboard, keeping the ability to bring *in* [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion)s and other more aggressive creatures to wreck the usual ways decks will try and deal with Abzan’s removal.



Despite winning last weekend, non-Abzan control decks are fairly scare. Blue-Black Control is around, and one player went undefeated with a Sultai-flavored version. Whether the extraordinary presence of aggressive decks squeezed then out, or Abzan Control is the new model of potency to look out for isn’t clear.


It will take several more rounds before the life, or death, of Seville’s control can be confirmed.
