> Mago: Callback to RAV Viashino Slasher. Gives common blue a 2-drop, and plays nicely with +1/+1 counter-granting cards.


Hint: Unguilded

> GSV: Making him a 1/2 gives Johnny players a really interesting build around that maybe has fringe constructed playability.  
> 
>  DH: Isn't this more appealing to Johnny as a 1/1? Also, not sure we want it to be 'easy' to make this start going off.  
> 
>  GTH: I believe it is more appealing as a 1/1. Cool card.


Hint: Orzhov
