There's nothing quite like sitting 8-0 heading into the final round of Day 1. You know you're into Day 2, and even if you lose you still have good position to Top 8. What should be the most stressful match of the day becomes a breeze, the perfect way to end a day. As they shuffled for their match, Vincent Thibeault and Colby Warkentin were clearly enjoying the relief that eight wins in the bag will give you.



**The Players**




 Vincent Thibeault is a former member of the Canadian National team. However, *Magic* has taken something of a backseat in his life. Between his job teaching philosophy at a CEGEP (a pre-University school for ages 17 & 18) in Montreal and raising a family he doesn't have nearly as much time to play. Still, a Limited Grand Prix next door was hard to turn down. "It's not like Constructed, you don't need to playtest as much."




 In contrast to Thibeault, Colby Warkentin is just starting his journey as a mage. He only learned the game a couple years ago, and this is his first Grand Prix. After studying Computer Science at the University of Alberta, Warkentin moved to Guelph, Ontario for work and dove into *Magic*. I asked him how much competitive play experience he had coming into this event. "Not a ton, I've played prereleases, FNM at my local store (The Dragon), Grand Prix Trials." How does he feel about the prospect of drafting against the field tomorrow? "Well, I think I know the format alright, but I know that Day 2 of a GP is nothing like drafting at FNM. I'm just going to do my best."




**The Games**




 The match started leisurely, both players setting up with nonbasics to get all their colors online. Warkentin built up his defenses behind Archer's [Parapet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parapet), summoning [Unyielding Krumar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unyielding+Krumar) and [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer). Thibeault had only a morph. He played his fifth land and passed with his mana untapped. That gave Warkentin pause.




 He checked his plan, and decided to go ahead with it. He pumped his Deathdealer to a 4/4, turning on [Savage Punch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Punch) for his [Unyielding Krumar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unyielding+Krumar) on Thibeault's morph. Thibeault unmorphed [War Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Behemoth) for the save. Warkentin sent his attackers and traded the Krumar for the damaged Behemoth, pumping his Deathdealer to knock Thibeault to twelve.
