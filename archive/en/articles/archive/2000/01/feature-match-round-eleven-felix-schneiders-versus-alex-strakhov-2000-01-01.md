Feature Match Round Eleven - Felix Schneiders versus Alex Strakhov
==================================================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)











Leading the field coming into this round, these players were already on the verge of qualifying for the top eight. Felix is one of the handful of German players who made the trip this weekend, while Alex is one of the best known Russians, as he has travelled to Grand Prix around Europe in the last season.


### Game One


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPWARSAW01/921.jpg)Alex played [Gerrard's Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard%27s+Verdict) on turn two, forcing Felix to discard [Yawgmoth's Agenda](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Agenda) and [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar), and showing that Felix was playing U-B-R Control, and Strakhov some form of No-Mar deck.


Schneiders cast a [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar), but Strakhov's [Vindicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) meant that he was suck on two land, although Alex himself only had three. They found land quite quickly though, and it didn't affect the game.


When Felix attempted to [Recoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoil) another of Alex's land, Strakhov [Disrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupt)ed it twice and took advantage of Felix being tapped out to [Dromar's Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromar%27s+Charm) the [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar), clearing the board.


The Russian played a [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), and this remained the only creature on the table for several turns, and stopped Felix from casting the [Prophetic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Bolt) in his hand. Eventually Schneiders removed it with an [Urza's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage), but it was replaced by a [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx).


Now the German managed to force a [Lobotomy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lobotomy) through, using a Spite to counter Alex's [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb). The [Lobotomy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lobotomy) showed that Strakhov had three more [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb)s in hand, and of course Felix took those. Strakhov's other cards were [Yawgmoth's Agenda](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Agenda), and [Lobotomy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lobotomy).


The Lynx continued to hit, bringing Felix down to ten, while he searched for answers with [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), finding a [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse). Now Felix had to make sure he kept the Agenda off the table. He cast [Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void) for two, permanently getting rid of the Lynx and a [Gerrard's Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard%27s+Verdict). At this point Alex conceded, a trifle prematurely as it seemed.


### Game Two


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPWARSAW01/920.jpg)Strakhov had to take a mulligan in game two, but nevertheless he played a turn two [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx). Felix wasn't bothered about the Lynx, as he had an [Emblazoned Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emblazoned+Golem). Alex took the chance to Lobotomize Felix while he was tapped out, taking the [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) but leaving [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine) and [Prophetic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Bolt).


Felix attacked and played a second Golem that he had plucked off the top, putting the Russian under some serious pressure. Strangely Alex decided to name [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine) with a [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), when he knew that Felix had [Prophetic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Bolt) and he had no way to stop it.


Looking for some way of stopping the Golems, Strakhov cast [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), and netted a second [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx). This didn't look to be nearly enough, as he was only on nine life, and Felix played a third [Emblazoned Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emblazoned+Golem). In desperation Alex played a [Yawgmoth's Agenda](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Agenda), and took a further five damage going down to four. This let him play the [Dromar's Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromar%27s+Charm) out of his graveyard, so that he could double-block one of the Golems and stay on four life.


The board position was Alex on four life with two [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx)es and a [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), and Felix with two [Emblazoned Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emblazoned+Golem)s and a [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar). Strakhov was annoyed that Felix had top-decked [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay) just before he had chance to cast the [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction).


Both players continued to draw land, and Alex's graveyard was exhausted, so the players spent several turns doing nothing, but Felix managed to find a [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse), and force it through with an [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine) since Alex could play only one spell per turn.
