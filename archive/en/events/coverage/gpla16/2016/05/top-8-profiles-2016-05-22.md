### Javier Dominguez


**Age:** 29


**Hometown:** Barcelona, Spain  

Previous Magic Accomplishments: 9th Place at Pro Tour Battle for Zendikar, GP Paris Winner


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Jund. I just carefully listened to Willy Edel, and then did the opposite.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  

Kalitas! It’s just the only bomb.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation). I played against lots of [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) decks.


**What is your story of triumph getting to this Top 8?**  

I needed one point to lock Gold, so I made it! Thanks to DEX Protection for making it possible.

### Corey Burkhart


**Age:** 24


**Hometown:** Alta Loma, CA


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

Pro Tour Battle for Zendikar Top 25, 4th GP Top 8 this season (1 Standard, 2 Modern, 1 Team Sealed)


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Grixis Control. [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) is exceptionally powerful. [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) seemed to be well-positioned, and I have a natural affinity for very grindy decks.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). It has the flexibility of a blue card, the power of a green card, and casts all your best spells (sans [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)). The loops with [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) and Kolaghan’s Command are too great to pass up.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Izzet Staticaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Staticaster). Always is, and always will be. The card answers many troubling “go wide” strategies, as well as combo elements like Infect, which I played against three times.


**What is your story of triumph getting to this Top 8?**  

Playing a control deck in a sea of combo and aggressive decks. Winning each game is very rewarding, as you don’t get the “free wins” other decks get.

### Cuong-Alexander To


**Age:** 23


**Hometown:** Norwalk, California


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**   

Qualified for Pro Tour *Shadows Over Innistrad*


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Affinity. It’s the deck I have the most experience with.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer). I played four Affinity mirrors matches in a row on Day 2.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion). It’s almost impossible to kill.


**What is your story of triumph getting to this Top 8?**  

I took each round one at a time and let the wins add up.

### Ethan Brown


**Age:** 13


**Hometown:** Portland, Oregon


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

12th Place at TCGPlayer States


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Affinity. It’s the only good Modern deck I have and it’s my favorite.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating). It pumps your creatures if you have a lot of artifacts.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon). It randomly destroys people.


**What is your story of triumph getting to this Top 8?**  

I came in 7-2 and then went 6-0, beating a lot of good players and getting really lucky.

### Erik Carson


**Age:** 27


**Hometown:** Roseburg, Oregon


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

17th Place at GP San Antonio 2012, multiple Day 2 cashes, 2 StarCityGames Legacy Top 8’s


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Abzan Company. It is difficult to disrupt and probably the most consistent and redundant deck in Modern.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company). It allows you to win out of nowhere, especially when backed by [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling).


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage). It beats the most common sideboard card against me, Grafdigger’s Cage. Anyone could have it in their board!


**What is your story of triumph getting to this Top 8?**  

This is my first Top 8, which has led to my first PT invite. I drove 12 hours to be here. I am beyond stoked!

### Pascal Maynard


**Age:** 23


**Hometown:** Quebec City


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

10th GP Top 8, Pro Tour Oath of the Gatewatch Top 8, Canadian National Team 2010


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Bant Eldrazi. Our team got help from the original designer of the deck, Todd Stevens. We tuned the deck, and most of us played it this weekend. I played it so I can cast Turn 2 [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer)s.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Eldrazi Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple). It’s just too unfair.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  

Either [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) or [Stony Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stony+Silence). Both just won me games by themselves.


**What is your story of triumph getting to this Top 8?**  

Had to 6-0 Day 2 to make it.

### Joe Lossett


**Age:** 36


**Hometown:** Newport Beach, California


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

5 StarCityGames Open wins


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

R/G Tron. I’ve been working on it for quite a while now, and I’m a big believer in sticking with one deck instead of switching it up for every event.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Ancient Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Stirrings) has to be the best cantrip in the format. It does everything. Need a land? Here you go! Need an unbeatable eight-drop? Here you go!


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Warping Wail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warping+Wail). [Crumble to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumble+to+Dust) is not a very friendly card.


**What is your story of triumph getting to this Top 8?**  

I was playing against Abzan Company. My Grafdigger’s Cage was holding back his entire hand. He drew and played [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage) and passed, because what difference did it make? SUDDEN SHOCK!

### Simon Slutsky


**Age:** 33


**Hometown:** Pasadena, CA


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**   

Day 2 at GP Oakland (6-3), PPTQ Finalist


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Merfolk. I know it well and it seemed well-positioned.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas), sadly. Lots of my opponents had cards stuck in their hands because of it.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Gut Shot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gut+Shot). It’s versatile and crucial against Melira combo and the mirror.


**What is your story of triumph getting to this Top 8?**  

Practice, dedication to the deck, and knowing when to trust the pros. I couldn’t have done it without seeing Ondřej Stráský’s list.
