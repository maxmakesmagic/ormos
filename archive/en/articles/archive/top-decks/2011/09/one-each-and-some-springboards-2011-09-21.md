One of the fun things about new cards is the opportunity to dig up old decks. I decided to pick a new *Innistrad* card from each color, talk about it a wee bit, and then maybe brew up a new deck or so, based on an older model.

So today we are going to revisit some of the mighty rogue lists from names you should recall—Ken Adams, Guillaume Wafo-Tapa, Shaheen Soorani, Randy Buehler (and others)—while we look through some of the interesting new stuff from *Innistrad*. No guarantees that any of the new brews are actually going to be great ... but hopefully at least one or two will be interesting to you, and give you a good idea that you can use to help shape the defining decks of the new Standard at Friday Night **Magic**, on **Magic Online**, and at [the upcoming 2011s](http://www.the2011s.com/).

Here are some of the cards I picked to use as centerpieces:

1. Divine Reckoning
2. Think Twice
3. Liliana of the Veil
4. Past in Flames
5. Mulch
Divine Reckoning
