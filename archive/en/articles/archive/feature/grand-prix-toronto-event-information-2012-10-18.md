Join us in Canada's cultural capital Toronto, Ontario for a Modern format Grand Prix, where cards from every set since *Eighth Edition* and *Mirrodin* will appear on the battlefield. The Toronto Congress Center is a stone's throw from Pearson International Airport, perfect for those players arriving by air. 


The event will feature promotional items (playmats, foils), a full slate of side events, vendors, artists, and everything else you've come to expect from a modern Grand Prix. And when the cards are put away, the city offers amazing food, beautiful sights, exciting night life, and a host of other amenities.




 *The **Magic: The Gathering** Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic** players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#2012).*

 The main tournament at Grand Prix Toronto is open to **Magic** players of all ages. 


 Players must have a signed publicity release form to be included in Wizards of the Coast's official online event coverage. Forms can be downloaded [here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/publicityrelease_grandprix_2011.pdf) (15k PDF) and will be available onsite. Minors must have a parent or guardian’s signature on this form. Publicity releases will be collected during registration. 




**Tournament Format**
  


* [Modern](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrmodern)
* Deck lists are required (download a list [here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/CONSTRUCTED_DECKLIST.pdf))
* Players must use the same deck on both days of the tournament and throughout playoff rounds.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).



**Judges**
  
 The Head Judge for this event will be Cristiana Dionisio. The window to apply for judge sponsorship is closed. 




**Notes**

Rules documents can be found in the [**Magic** Document Center](http://www.wizards.com/wpn/Events/Rules.aspx?category=magic:thegathering) .
* Players must bring pen, paper, card sleeves and appropriate counters.
* In the event that a player who wins an invitation to a Pro Tour stop at a Grand Prix has already qualified for an invitation, the invitation does not pass down under any circumstances. Previous qualification may be through a Qualifier tournament, through performance at a professional tournament, or by being an invited DCI player (valid upon the date of the official rank announcement for the appropriate professional tournament).
