 David works on the Magic community team as a content specialist. He spends his days writing about Magic Online and trying to play too many colors at once in Limited. 






June 20 came and went without much fanfare. The fans cried out, "Did you forget *Magic Online*'s Anniversary? Think of how hurt *Magic Online* will be!" Don't worry, we didn't forget. As a matter of fact, we were busy planning an event that stretches across space and time. Specifically, the last 12 years of time. Also, only the space directly relating to *Magic Online*. We think the community, and *Magic Online*, will be pleasantly surprised.


We've got tons of events planned for the big 12, all of which will take you on a stroll down memory lane with your favorite online trading card game. Remember playing that Holiday Cube? The smell of pine and roasted chestnuts on the chill breeze? Well, the Holiday Cube found its way into July and it's accompanied by a *Modern Masters* Flashback Draft!


How about those crazy days spent drafting *Innistrad*? Players will be able to revisit the most tender of moments with *Innistrad*, Ravnica, and many more of the greatest planes and sets. Between July 2 and July 15, we're running a series of *Magic Online* Anniversary Event Qualifiers that will feature different sets and blocks each and every day! If players place highly enough, they can even get an invitation to the grand finale, the *Magic Online* Anniversary Event Finals.


Sounds like a great party, right? Head on over to the [12th Anniversary article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/its-magic-onlines-12th-anniversary-2014-06-23) for the full details!
