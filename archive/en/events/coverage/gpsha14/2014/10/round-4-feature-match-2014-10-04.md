 Just one point short of becoming the Japanese National Champion, you might think that Yuuki Ichikawa has had a disappointing season. Far from it. Making back-to-back Pro Tour Top 8s last season, he came dangerously close of robbing Yuuya Watanabe of the coveted spot in the World *Magic* Cup. Despite that little heartbreak, he wound up Platinum last season and finds himself paired against one of South Korea's best, Park Jun Young.



While not having equally dominating Pro Tour results, Park has proven that he is no slouch when it comes to the Grand Prix Circuit. After placing Top 8 at Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur 2014, he moved on to win Grand Prix Minneapolis 2014, before making Top 8 at Grand Prix Sydney 2014 again. That's three Grand Prix Top 8s in a calendar year. Wow. Today, he has put together a five-color deck, with as much removal and bombs as he could fit in.


Game 1
======


Park won the die roll and elected to play first.



 Both players spent the first two turns getting their mana problems out of the way, putting into play a variety of tapped dual lands. Ichikawa was the first to act, Scouting the Borders to fetch a Swamp, before exiling his whole graveyard on turn 4 to summon [Shambling Attendants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Attendants). Park produced [Jeskai Windscout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Windscout) and used [Suspension Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suspension+Field) to rid himself of the zombie.




 Ichikawa's next play was [Dazzling Ramparts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dazzling+Ramparts) and the game started slowing to a crawl.




 Park produced [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury), the perfect solution to a potentially problematic [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer). Ichikawa had a same copy of the removal spell, killing Park's second [Jeskai Windscout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Windscout) that he couldn't tap down. Once again exiling his entire graveyard, he cheaply cast [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut) to destroy Park's [Alabaster Kirin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Kirin). When Ichikawa added [Abomination of Gudul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abomination+of+Gudul) and [Pine Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pine+Walker) to the board, Park replied with double [Burn Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burn+Away).





*Park's five-color control deck does* Magic*.*
