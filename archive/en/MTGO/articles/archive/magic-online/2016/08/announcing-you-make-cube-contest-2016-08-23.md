Have you ever played one of our *Magic Online* Cube offerings and thought: "You know what would be a really great cube?" Well now is your chance to submit your design for our next *Magic Online* cube and possibly even win fantastic prizes!


We have heard repeatedly from our community that they have cubes they would like to play on *Magic Online*. This is your chance! We're looking to take the best cube out there and make it a reality on *Magic Online*.


If your submission is chosen to be one of the four finalists, you'll win four complete digital non-premium sets of *Kaladesh* and 1,000 play points in *Magic Online*. The finalists will be contacted by the *Magic* R&D team to help them develop their cube submissions further. During this period, the finalists will work in tandem with designers and developers from *Magic* R&D to further tune their cube lists for optimal play. Finalists can expect to be contacted by October 1, 2016.


After the development period, the updated cube lists will be posted for the community to review by October 17. During that review period, we will open up voting for our community to choose their favorite of the posted submissions. The winning submission will then be announced and the grand prize winner will receive an additional four premium digital sets of *Kaladesh* and an additional 1,000 Play Points!


Submissions will be judged on the following criteria:


1. Creativity—We're looking for a cube that's different than our existing offerings (*Vintage*, *Legacy*, and *Legendary Cube*). The cards can overlap as much or as little as you like with our other cubes, but we're looking for a novel play experience.
2. Fun—We're looking for a cube that *Magic Online* players of all skill levels be able to have fun playing. If you need to know how to resolve a [Doomsday](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomsday) combo in order to play black in the cube you're submitting, maybe think of other ways that the archetype could go.
3. Feasibility—We're looking for a cube that we can add to *Magic Online* in time for the November release. If your submission requires that packs for the draft consist of only a single color, that might take technical work that we can't do in time for the November cube.
4. Replayability—*Magic Online* players draft a lot. If your cube design has a play experience that would be less exciting after being played only a few times, I would try to find a way to modify it so even someone who has already played it many times is still interested.
5. Cube Submission Format
	1. Should be 540 cards. It does not have to be color balanced, though. For example, you could submit a mono-green cube if you wanted to!
	2. The submission can only contain cards that are playable on *Magic Online* as of the *Eldritch Moon* release.
	3. Download and fill out [this spreadsheet](http://media.wizards.com/2016/mtgo/YouMakeTheCubeTemplate.xlsx).
	4. Must email the completed spreadsheet as an attachment to [magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com](mailto:magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com?Subject=You%20Make%20the%20Cube%20Submission) before September 15, 2016.
		1. Do not add images, macros, non-text objects, or change the format of the above spreadsheet, or it may cause your submission to be rejected.
	5. Adherence to the Contest Rules—We're asking for cube submissions in a specific format because we're expecting to get a bunch of people entering. We will have to toss out any submissions that don't follow the above formatting and/or [the contest terms and conditions](#terms).Best of luck to you all as you set out to work on your cube submissions. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me by asking a question on [Tumblr](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/) or on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RobertJSchuster).
