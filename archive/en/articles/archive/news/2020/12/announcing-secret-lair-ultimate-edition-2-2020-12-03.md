*Secret Lair*'s WPN-exclusive Ultimate Edition series is back with *Secret Lair*: Ultimate Edition 2!


Ultimate Edition 2 will be available Spring 2021 at [WPN stores](https://locator.wizards.com/) around the world. This boxed set features ten full-art Pathway lands with brand-new art from ten of *Magic*'s best artists (Paul Scott Canavan, Alayna Danner, Piotr Dura, Grady Frederick, Donato Giancola, Yeong-Hao Han, Adam Paquette, Lucas Staniec, Jokubas Uogintas, and Johannes Voss) depicting the Planes of Kaldheim and Zendikar.


The six of these Pathway lands originally printed in *Zendikar Rising* are featured in Ultimate Edition 2 with art showcasing the Plane of Kaldheim instead.

The other four Pathways are coming very soon with *Kaldheim*, so we can't show them off here just yet, but the Ultimate Edition 2 versions will have art set on Zendikar. That means across all printings of these cards, you'll be able to nab complete cycles set on either Planeâ€”or both!


Like the first *Secret Lair*: Ultimate Edition, Ultimate Edition 2 will arrive in a beautiful commemorative box that can be used for display. Due to issues surrounding procurement during the global pandemic, some of the boxes will be black and some will be dark gray. (There is no difference between the two other than color.)


We're printing more copies of Ultimate Edition 2 than we did of the first Ultimate Edition, but supplies will still be limited, so check with your [local game store](https://locator.wizards.com/) to secure your copy!
