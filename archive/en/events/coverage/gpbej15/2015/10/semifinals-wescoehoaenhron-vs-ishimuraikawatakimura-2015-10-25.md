Wescoe/Hoaen/Hron were pretty much at the top of the standings all weekend, and lived up to expectations. As the first team to lock up their spot in the Top 4, they even had the luxury to concede the last Swiss round in order for a more favorable pairing in the Top 4 Playoffs.


Their opponents' (Ishimura/Ikawa/Takimura) road wasn't as smooth-sailing though. As one of the two teams going 11-3, only one team would make it to the Top 4 and they were able to triumph over Kato/Yasooka/Kakumae at “War of the Tiebreakers”.

*Kazuyuki Takimura, Yoshihiko Ikawa and Shintaro Ishimura attempt to take revenge!*


After navigating through fourteen rounds of Team Sealed, both teams will now be facing the daunting challenges of Team Draft. Not only would they need to assemble the best deck possible, they also need to be careful about passing good cards to their opponents.


Also, it was very possible for the signals to be read perfectly, and after the draft had concluded, each of these six players should know exactly what matchups they were up against.


A truly exciting match awaits!




---

### Table A: Craig Wescoe (White-Blue splash Green) vs. Shintaro Ishimura (Black-Green Eldrazi)


Wescoe's deck was a classic White-Blue deck with a lot of evasion and powerful bombs such as [Noyan Dar, Roil Shaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noyan+Dar%2C+Roil+Shaper) and [Felidar Sovereign](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Sovereign). He also had [Lumbering Falls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumbering+Falls) to help splash [Kiora, Master of the Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+Master+of+the+Depths) and [Skyrider Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyrider+Elf). What he was struggling with was whether [Scatter to the Winds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+to+the+Winds), [Stasis Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Snare) and [Sheer Drop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sheer+Drop) were sufficient answers for Ishimura's Eldrazi monsters.

Unbeknownst to Wescoe, Ishimura's Black-Green Eldrazi Ramp deck didn't have many feared late-game bombs. As a matter of fact, both Ikawa and Takimura were deeply concerned about how Ishimura's deck had turned out. Despite having the mana acceleration and Eldrazi Scion generators, Ishimura had only a couple of haymakers to ruin Wescoe's day.


In Game 1, Ishimura stymied Wescoe's opening of [Felidar Cub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Cub) [Shadow Glider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Glider) and [Cloud Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Manta) with [Carrion Thrall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Thrall), [Catacomb Sifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Sifter) and [Giant Mantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Mantis). [Kozilek's Channeler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Channeler) into [Breaker of Armies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breaker+of+Armies) were Ishimura's next two plays, and Wescoe's board could be decimated in one fell swoop.


Fearing Ondu's Uprising, Ishimura tread carefully and declined to attack when Wescoe kept all his mana open. He was, however, forced to budge when [Kiora, Master of the Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+Master+of+the+Depths) hit the board. Sure enough, Wescoe had a trick, but it was [Roilmage's Trick](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roilmage%27s+Trick) to keep Kiora alive while taking down [Breaker of Armies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breaker+of+Armies). Faced with no other choice, Ishimura attacked with his entire team to take down Kiora, suffering significant losses.

After that nerve-wrecking episode, the board returned to a stalemate, with both parties loading threats onto the table. However, approximately a hundred turns later, Ishimura drew into [Vampiric Rites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Rites), [Brood Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brood+Butcher) and finally, the [Swarm Surge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+Surge) that would secure him the first game.

*Mike Hron's match is concluded as he watches Rich Hoaen's and Craig Wescoe's match. Did he win?*


A few turns into his second game, Wescoe received updates that he didn't need to play out his next two games. That could only mean good news. Or the worst.


**Craig Wescoe 0—Shintaro Ishimura 1**

### Table B: Rich Hoaen (Blue-Red) vs. Yoshihiko Ikawa (White-Black Lifegain Allies)


Hoaen's deck was a hybrid of Devoid and Ingest, as can be seen from his triple [Mist Intruder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Intruder)s, triple [Murk Strider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murk+Strider)s and double [Nettle Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Drone)s. A tempo deck at heart, aimed to strike at the heart.


Ikawa's deck sought to abuse [Serene Steward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serene+Steward) and [Kalastria Nightwatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Nightwatch) by triggering them with Kalastria Healer, [Stone Haven Medic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Haven+Medic) and [Ruin Processor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+Processor). With so much lifegain in his Ally-themed deck, this matchup looked to be interesting.


Sure enough, in the first game, Ikawa gummed up the ground with a duo of [Fortified Rampart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortified+Rampart)s before attempting to soar through the skies with [Courier Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courier+Griffin). Hoaen's [Titan's Presence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titan%27s+Presence) put a stop to that plan, and also broke apart the combo of [Stone Haven Medic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Haven+Medic) and [Serene Steward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serene+Steward) with [Processor Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Processor+Assault). Despite the defenses, Ikawa couldn't help but take continuous damage from a pair of [Mist Intruder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Intruder)s and the double [Nettle Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Drone)s relentlessly pinging away.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mist+Intruder)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Intruder)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nettle+Drone)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Drone)
In Game 2, Hoaen led with [Mist Intruder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Intruder) and two [Nettle Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Drone)s once again. After all, he did have multiple copies of each. Ikawa's removal-light deck wasn't well-equipped to deal with them, and could only attempt to race with [Serene Steward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serene+Steward), [Ondu Greathorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ondu+Greathorn) and a pair of [Kalastria Nightwatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Nightwatch).


If only Ikawa could find a reliable way to gain life. Well, it turned out that he didn't even need the [Ruin Processor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+Processor) in his hand. Attacking with both 4/5s, he brought Hoaen down to 2 life. If Hoaen were to draw a colorless card, he would be able to kill Ikawa with a flurry of [Nettle Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Drone) triggers. He didn't.


Ikawa counterattacked for the win, with just one life left in the bank.


Game 3 saw Ikawa keeping Hron's [Mist Intruder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Intruder) and [Cloud Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Manta) at home with [Courier Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courier+Griffin). However, [Titan's Presence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titan%27s+Presence) cleared away the obstacle, allowing Hoaen to race through the skies. [Clutch of Currents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+Currents) further was Ikawa's subsequent setback, followed by [Murk Strider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murk+Strider). Ikawa could not get [Kalastria Nightwatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Nightwatch) to stick for even a single turn. The tremendous tempo advantage coupled with [Touch of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Touch+of+the+Void) and [Nettle Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Drone) ensured Hoaen's (and his team's) victory.


Why? Spoiler alert! Because Hron had won his match too!


**Rich Hoaen 2—Yoshihiko Ikawa 0**

### Table C: Mike Hron (Black-Red Devoid) vs. Kazuyuki Takimura (White-Red)


Hron put together a lightning-fast aggro deck featuring a pair of Forerunner of [Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter)s. Aside from the usual colorless suspects, Hron also had end-game troublemakers such as [Barrage Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrage+Tyrant) and [Guul Draz Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guul+Draz+Overseer).


Takimura's White-Red deck was also fairly standard, featuring a bunch of weenies backed by cheap tricks. In particular, [Tandem Tactics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tandem+Tactics) seemed to shine in this combat-oriented, damage-based matchup.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Makindi+Sliderunner)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makindi+Sliderunner)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Angelic+Gift)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Gift)
[Angelic Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Gift) lifted [Makindi Sliderunner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makindi+Sliderunner) from the ground and threatened Hron's life total. When he tried [Complete Disregard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Complete+Disregard) to exile it, Takimura saved it with [Lithomancer's Focus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lithomancer%27s+Focus). Stuck on three lands, Takimura forged ahead and quickly claimed the first game.


Next game, Hron led with Forerunner of [Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter) and [Valakut Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut+Predator), but declined to attack when Takimura passed his third turn with three mana open. Considering that he had [Expedition Envoy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Envoy) and [Pathway Arrows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pathway+Arrows) on the battlefield (which he declined to equip), that certainly smelt very fishy indeed.


Hron played around a potential trick, adding [Hagra Sharpshooter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hagra+Sharpshooter) to the board, taking aim. Takimura presented nothing else, and lost his 2/1 to the the [Hagra Sharpshooter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hagra+Sharpshooter) the next turn. With an empty board, Takimura quickly got flattened.


In the third, Hron led with [Sludge Crawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sludge+Crawler) and Forerunner of [Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter), while Takimura could only cough up [Valakut Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut+Predator) as a blocker. While adept at attacking, the Landfall creature was a [Gray Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Ogre) on defense. Nonetheless, Takimura took the trade and Hron replaced the fallen with [Dominator Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dominator+Drone).


Stuck on only Red mana, Takimura could only watch while a second Forerunner of [Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter) and another [Dominator Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dominator+Drone) rip away at his life total.


**Mike Hron 2—Kazuyuki Takimura 1**
