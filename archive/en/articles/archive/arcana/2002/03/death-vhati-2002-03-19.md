In his [article yesterday](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mr12), Mark Rosewater wrote, "One of my favorite contributions to *Tempest* was a series of three cards that spelled out a little scene between [Commander Greven il-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Commander%2BGreven%2Bil-Vec) and [Vhati il-Dal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Vhati%2Bil-Dal)."

Here is that sequence of flavor text, spanning [Repentance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repentance), [Vhati il-Dal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vhati+il-Dal), and [Diabolic Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict).

The story behind this exchange is as follows: Greven had boarded the *[Skyship Weatherlight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Skyship%2BWeatherlight)*and was engaged in a swordfight with [Gerrard Capashen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Gerrard%2BCapashen). Vhati -- back aboard the *[Predator, Flagship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Predator%252C%2BFlagship)* -- ordered his moggs to fire upon the *Weatherlight*, hoping to kill Gerrard and rid himself of they tyrannical Greven at the same time. Unfortunately for Vhati, things didn't go as plannedâ€¦.
