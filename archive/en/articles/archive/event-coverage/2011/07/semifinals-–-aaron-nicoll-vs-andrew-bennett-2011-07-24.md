After chatting about which Australian state they were representing in the top 4 – Andrew Bennett was New South Wales, while Aaron Nicoll had recently relocated from Queensland to Victoria – Nicoll won the die roll and unsurprisingly, elected to play.


Bennett shuffled away his opening hand with a "not today. I've mulliganed more times in the top 8 than I have all day!"


"Well, you are playing a very high variance deck," Nicoll quipped.


"That's true," admitted Bennett, keeping his six.


Nicoll summoned a [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), while Bennett paid two life to summon a [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge). Nicoll [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed twice, shuffling after the first, and summoned a second [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), while Bennett summoned a [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer). An [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) took out the Overseer, so Bennett replaced it with another [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) and a [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest). A [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) found Nicoll a [Splinter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin for his [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime), but Bennett continued to attack with his Skirges. Nicoll made another Slime copy, but could only pass the turn back with a shrug. Bennett attacked again, but scooped when Nicoll flashed him another Twin, a [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), and a "kill you?"


Nicoll 1 – Bennett 0


[Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) and [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) on turn one from Bennett signaled a better start to the game, with Nicoll's first play being an [Overgrown Battlement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement). [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) for Bennett forced his point, while Nicoll copied his Battlement with a [Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image), and dropped to 6. Bennett summoned a [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) and a [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) Idol and passed the turn back. Nicoll drew for the turn, pursed his lips, [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed, shuffled, and scooped.

On the draw for game three, Bennett's opening turn was still no less threatening, with [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite), [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite), and [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest). This time, Nicoll had the [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) for a sweet three for one. "You either had it or you didn't," Bennett sighed, as Nicoll summoned a Battlement. The downside to Bennett's hand became swiftly apparent as he missed his second land drop. Nicoll summoned a [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum), while Bennett summoned a pair of [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge)s. [Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) copied the [Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=389682), putting Nicoll's land count at seven to Bennett's one. Another [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) wiped Bennett's team, and refilled Nicoll's hand. Bennett found a second land and summoned a [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer), but Nicoll [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed into a [Frost Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan). A third [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) sealed the deal.


Nicoll 2 – Bennett 1


Both players kept. Nicoll immediately, but Bennett after some thought. "Someone looks happy," Bennett ventured, summoning a pair of [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite)s and an [Origin Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin+Spellbomb). "I was just happy you tanked for so long," Nicoll laughed, summoning a [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). A [Dispatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispatch) took out the Birds, and the [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite)s were joined by a third, but Bennett once again lacked a second land. "Come on, you know you want to," Bennett coaxed Nicoll. "I'd totally [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) if I had one," Nicoll replied, instead summoning a [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite).

Bennett thumped the top of deck, but still came up short. He sent in his team. Nicoll flashed in a [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), killing one of the [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite)s. "Mountain, kill me?" Bennett asked, but Nicoll shook his head, summoning a [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum). "Ooh, fetch a Mountain and kill me next turn," Bennett clarified, which was exactly what happened.
