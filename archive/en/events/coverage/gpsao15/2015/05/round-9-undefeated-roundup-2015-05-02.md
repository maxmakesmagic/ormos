After eight rounds of Swiss, only six players remained at pristine 8-0 records, and we invited all of them to the feature match area to see who would remain undefeated overnight.


Table 1: Fabio Barroso (Abzan Midrange) vs. Renato B Wohlers (Esper Dragons)
============================================================================


A key card in Game 1 was [Perilous Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Vault), which Wohlers added to his deck in anticipation of otherwise hard-to-answer threats. It got a monstrous [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), but it was not enough. Wohlers never drew a [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) over the course of the entire game, and he eventually lacked the removal spells to answer [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix).


In game two, Barroso tried to play a control game with planeswalkers and [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities), but it was to no avail. Wohlers found [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) to answer Barroso's threats, and followed it up with [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) into [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) for the win.

Although the above summary might suggest that the games were quick, that's only because I left out all of the grindy one-for-one trades. In actuality, the games took many turns, and there were only minutes on the clock for the third game. That was not enough time to finish it, and the match ended in a draw.

Table 2: Mariano Cartechini (Abzan Aggro) vs. Ricardo Felipe Camargo (Temur Aggro)
==================================================================================


In Game 1, Felipe Camargo had a turn-three [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) followed by two [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike)s for the blockers, and Cartechini was unable to beat that start.


Game 2 featured a damage race between [Ashloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashloud+Phoenix) and [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) on Camargo's side and [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) plus [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) on Catechini's side. It was close, but in the end Cartechini came out victorious.

Game 3 was reminiscent of Game 1. Felipe Camargo again had a quick [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster), and he was able to clear the way with [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) and Roast. Then [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) came down, and [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) was not the right answer for Cartechini.

Table 3: Julio Cesar Maciel (Bant Heroic) vs. Gabriel Jose Wood (Bant Megamorph)
================================================================================


Game 1 started with mana troubles for Maciel, as he only had white mana with several non-white cards in hand. It looked like Wood would defeat his color-screwed opponent with [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) and [Surrak, the Hunt Caller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surrak%2C+the+Hunt+Caller), but Maciel found Mana [Confluence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confluence) just in time. He carefully sequenced [Ordeal of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Thassa) and [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) and protected his heroic creature with [Gods Willing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) to snatch the first game from the jaws of defeat.


In Game 2, Maciel had a good start with [Favored Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite), [Ordeal of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Thassa), and [autocard]Gods Willing[/
autocard] to protect it from [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance). However, [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) got back [Valerous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valerous+Stance), and this time it was successful. Maciel then tried to race [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) with [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor), but he failed as the Dragonlord overwhelmed him.

Game 3 was all about [Favored Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite) plus [Aqueous Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form). Wood was unable to block it and had fewer removal spells than Maciel had protection spells.
