***Which Khans of Tarkir card has changed the most in your evaluation for Limited?***
=====================================================================================


By now, the set has been out for several months, and after getting more experience with the set, card evaluations have changed. I was curious to learn what card has changed the most in people’s evaluation.

**No. 9 Lee Shi Tian:** [Tormenting Voice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormenting+Voice) is much better than I had expected. You want to play 18 lands in this format, and [Tormenting Voice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormenting+Voice) mitigates mana flood while providing enough gas for the game.

**No. 23 Yuuki Ichikawa:** [Monastery Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Flock) because the draft metagame has changed over time. In the beginning, W/B Warriors was best, then R/G Ferocious, and now I like defensive decks. [Monastery Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Flock) is great in a control-style draw-first deck with 18 lands.
