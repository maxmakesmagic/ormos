*What's your favorite token in **Magic**, and why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_montyashley.jpg)**Monty Ashley:** It might not being the biggest creature ever (in fact, I'm fairly sure it's one of the smallest) but I have a great fondness for the Plant token from *Worldwake*. I don't care whether I use [Avenger of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar) or [Khalni Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden) to get one; there's just something about having a Plant that makes me happy.

Here's why: many years ago, I lived with a cat named "Plant." It was my girlfriend's cat, and she named it after this Sesame Street cartoon she vaguely remembered in which a guy says "Wake up, Plant!" Then he tries several things to wake up his plant before remembering to pour water on it. I believe her goal was to wake Plant up by pouring water over her head, but that never actually happened. As far as I know.

Now, Plant was an active kitty. She was always pouncing on things and generally acting like a mighty hunter. And I got in the habit of shouting "Get 'em, Plant!" whenever she was on the trail of a particularly dangerous clump of dust. So you can imagine how delighted I was when I first played in a *Zendikar / Worldwake* draft and had the following game:

**Turn One:** [Khalni Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden), Plant Token (Hello, Plant!)  
**Turn Two:** [Trusty Machete](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trusty+Machete)  
**Turn Three:** Get 'em, Plant!

Incidentally, I should also mention that I'm also pretty fond of the adorable cartoon Plant tokens on [Inkwell Looter](http://inkwelllooter.blogspot.com/2010/06/easy-being-green.html). But they're still not as cute as Plant was.
