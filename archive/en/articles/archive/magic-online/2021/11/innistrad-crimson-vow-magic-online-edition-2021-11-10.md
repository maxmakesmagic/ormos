Night of the Vampire
====================


Welcome to *Innistrad: Crimson Vow*, *Magic Online* Edition! Now that the sunset has slowed and the Celestus has been defended, there's only one left thing to do: attend the biggest wedding event on Innistrad, and everybody will be there! Olivia's getting married, and it's gonna be the wedding of the century!


Release the Bats
================


With the second set in 2021's Innistrad "block" come the usual events: Constructed Leagues reset, Limited Leagues end, avatars for the previous set are distributed, and Treasure Chests get updated. You'll be able to find out what we do in the shadows when *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* events begin at 10 a.m. PT on Thursday, September 11.


*Innistrad: Crimson Vow* brings a couple new mechanics in the form of cleave and Blood tokens. But these are [not anything too terribly complicated, so the risk of rummaging up confusion is not too] great! And of course, with any release, we also fix issues, such as those affecting [Faerie Miscreant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Miscreant) and [Architects of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Architects+of+Will).


At Dawn, They Sleep
===================


Redemption will return for *Innistrad: Crimson Vow,* so you can turn an entire set of digital Vampires into paper ones to bring home! Like *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*, the full-art eternal night basic lands will also be required. The dates this time around are:


* **Redemption Begins**: December 15, 2021
* **Redemption Reprint Guarantee Date**: March 2, 2022
* **Redemption Cutoff Date**: April 6, 2022

We Suck Young Blood
===================


As mentioned before, Treasure Chests have been rebalanced, and not only has the drop rate of many *Modern Horizons 2* cards been increased, many new promos from *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* will also be available!


But that's not all: We've got eight cards from *Innistrad: Crimson Vow Commander* (VOC) that can also be found in Treasure Chests. While we're just as passionate as you are about this game, there have been a whole lot of sweet *Magic* cards released this year, and we'll bring as many as we can to *Magic Online*!


The list of VOC cards included in Treasure Chests with this VOW release are:


* [Markov Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Enforcer)
* [Scion of Opulence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+Opulence)
* [Timin, Youthful Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timin%2C+Youthful+Geist)
* [Rhoda, Geist Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhoda%2C+Geist+Avenger)
* [Thundering Mightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundering+Mightmare)
* [Imperious Mindbreaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Mindbreaker)
* [Crossway Troublemakers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crossway+Troublemakers)
* [Haunted Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Library)

We're also adding some new promos of existing *Magic* cards with sweet new art to Treasure Chests! These are all cards that are already in the client, but if they've ever appeared in Treasure Chests or in cubes, they will be replaced with these new versions:

But that's not all! You will now be able to find all 39 stained-glass planeswalkers from *War of the Spark* in Treasure Chests! Recall that time Nicol Bolas almost destroyed an entire plane with zombies from another plane brought there by a magical device from yet another plane. Yeah, it was a whole thing.

Vampire Blues
=============


Now, let's check out the avatars you'll be able to find in *Innistrad: Crimson Vow*:


This time of year gives us the opportunity to reflect on things we're thankful for and the people that have come into our lives. So, for *Innistrad: Crimson Vow*, I wanted to communicate that by giving *everybody* the chance to showcase the bond of [Halana and Alena, Partners](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halana+and+Alena%2C+Partners).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/Partners.png)


So, all you need to do is visit the Store, and use "PARTNERS" as a promo code, and you'll get this duo as an avatar of your own! They'll also be available on *MTG Arena* as part of "[The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-innistrad-crimson-vow-2021-11-04)" event. After all, love knows no bounds, and friends are just family you choose.


Now, to see what Prestige avatars are up for stake! As a reminder, you get five points for each Competitive Trophy you win in Leagues and one for each Friendly Trophy. At the end of the *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* season, you'll earn every avatar you qualify for:


* Earning at least 5 points gets you the uncommon Sorin, the Mirthless. He's just standing there, broodingly!
* Earning at least 20 points nabs you the rare Chandra, Dressed to Kill. Her fashion sense is on fire!
* Earning 40 points rewards you with the mythic Kaya, Geist Hunter. Crashing through windows and vampire weddings? That's just Kaya's game.

And finally, here are the guests who have signed the guestlist at Olivia's wedding to be avatars. They can be found in Treasure Chests and are always tradeable.


The Treasure Chest avatars for *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* are:


* Revealing Eye
* Grolnok, the Omnivore
* Jadar, Ghoulcaller of Nephalia
* Odric, Blood-Cursed
* Anje, Maid of Dishonor
* Thalia, Guardian of Thraben
* Cackling Culprit
* Innocent Traveler
* Mischievous Catgeist
* Blood Petal Celebrant

Vampires Will Never Hurt You
============================


And here's a preview of the alternate-play experiences you can expect during *Innistrad: Crimson Vow.* All events run for a week, except where noted:


* November 17: **Innistrad Chaos Draft**! A draft format where the packs are randomly distributed from among all eight sets on Innistrad!
* November 24: ***Live the Dream Cube*** returns! Get ready for big mana, big spells, and big fun.
* December 1: **The Modern Banned Gauntlet** arrives! You'll be able to choose a preconstructed Modern deck with a card we've banned in it and see how these "too good for Modern" decks fare against each other!
* December 8: If you've tried *Jumpstart* or *MTG Arena*'s *Jump In!*, can I interest you in a format similar to those where you pick from among all cards in *Magic*'s history? For two weeks, you'll get to experience **Super Jump**, where you'll get to pick two packets from among those with such names as: "Bloodbraid," "Death's Shadow," and "Stuffy Doll"!
* December 22: ***Vintage Cube*** returns for the traditional three-week run over the holidays with updates from *Innistrad: Crimson Vow*!
* January 12: It's time for a bonus week of *Vintage Cube* with ***Supreme Vintage Cube***, which is like regular *Vintage Cube*, but every pick is a first pick! So you might end up with a deck with ten pieces of the Power 9!
* January 19: *Legendary Cube* designer Usman Jamil brings his ***Ravnica Cube*** to *Magic Online*!
* January 26: For two weeks until the launch of *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty*, you'll be able to join tabletop by playing ***Innistrad: Double Feature*** right in your very home!

Bloodletting (The Vampire Song)
===============================


And that is all we have vowed to bring you all for *Innistrad: Crimson Vow*. As always, thank you for joining us on this journey into the latest return to what might be the most popular plane in the game. If you have any feedback, I do read basically everything anybody says about *Magic Online* on Twitter or elsewhere, and believe me, what you say does matter, as it helps us shape the future of *Magic*, whether it be *Magic Online*, *MTG Arena*, or tabletop!


So put on your fancy clothes, prepare for a wild reception, and get ready for a wedding to die for. Bwahaha!
