The 2009 **Magic** Pro Tour season concluded in [Rome at the World Championships](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/coverage-2009-world-championships-2009-11-12), and now it's time to see how the dust has settled. Worlds showcased the best players in Standard, Extended, and *Zendikar* Booster Draft. What Standard and Extended decks did the best against the field? Was Jund the juggernaut everyone thought it would be in Standard? Did Rubin Zoo continue its run from Pro Tour-Austin in the Extended rounds? Paul Jordan crunched the numbers for all the major deck archetypes. If you're looking for the hard numbers on what beat what, you won't want to miss it.
