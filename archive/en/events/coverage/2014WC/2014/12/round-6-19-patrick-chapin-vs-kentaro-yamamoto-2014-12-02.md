"Sole undefeated player" has such a nice ring to it. After the fifth round, nineteenth-ranked Patrick Chapin was wearing that mantle and finding it rather to his liking.



 There are few who can match Patrick Chapin when it comes to sheer passion for the game of *Magic*. For years he ate, slept, and breathed *Magic* and it's help make him one of the game's best. Nowadays he has to balance the work he does as a pro player against the demands of his "other" full-time job as a professional game designer. This weekend his Modern deck of choice is Blue-Red Delver keying off [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), which he calls "the most powerful card in the format."




 His opponent for this round was rising Japanese star Kentaro Yamamoto. In 2007 he quietly finished in second at the Two-Headed Giant Pro Tour alongside Yuuta Takahashi, and since then in Japan he's been known as a player to watch. His progress has been steadily leading him to his breakout Top 8 at Pro Tour *Theros* in Dublin. A quiet and meticulous player, he stacked up Pro Points to earn himself an at-large qualification for the World Championship. For Modern he pinned his hopes on Temur Delver, dipping into green for [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), and naturally taking full advantage of [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise). Yamamoto was sitting at 4-1.





*While Hall of Famer Patrick Chapin pursued his sixth win, Yamamoto was seeking his fifth, with both players sporting stellar starts to the tournament.*
