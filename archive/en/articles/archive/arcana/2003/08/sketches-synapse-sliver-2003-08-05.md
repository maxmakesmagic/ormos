This week's "Sketches" takes an insider's look at that [coastal piracy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=coastal%2Bpiracy)-esque Sliver from *Legions*, [Synapse Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Synapse+Sliver). **Magic** art vet Thomas Baxa was tapped to illustrate the card.

### 1. Art Description

These were the instructions given to the artist:

 "Location: Riptide project  
 Action: Show a very powerful sliver wrapped around a victim it has ensnared. Its prey is going limp as the sliver sucks the energy from the head of its victim through its specalized talon.  
 Notes: See the style guide for the sliver concept, but feel free to give it some slight variations, especially in the talon which is equipped to leech mind energy."

### 2. Sketches

Here is Thomas's original pencil sketch. You can see how he nailed the twist on the normal Sliver talon, which you can see on [Talon Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talon+Sliver) or [Root Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Root+Sliver).

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. Take that, mind (and face) of some random Riptide unfortunate!

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you can see it in booster packs.
