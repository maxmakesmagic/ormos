Eivind was really unlucky during the draft but still managed a solid deck while Rapahel got an average deck with 2 huge bombs: [Akroma's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance) and [Insurrection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insurrection). You can read about the draft [here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2002-grand-prix-copenhagen-draft-2-table-4-antoine-ruel-and-eivind).

Game 1 

After a thinking long and hard Rapael decided his opening off seven wouldn't be good enough; he kept his second hand though and even had a turn play: a [Gustcloak Runner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Runner). Eivind played a second turn [Wirewood Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Herald) which he described as a good blocker. A [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) came down next turn and it started the beats. Raphael just laid 3 morph creatures stalling on three lands. A [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) came down on Eivind's side and with the three Elves in play Raphael could better get rid of it quick. When Eivind played Prowling Pagolin he said: "Any player may sacrifice two, I choose not to".

"I do" said R "or do you want to sacrifice 1 on 1?". He then proceeded to sacrifice a morph guy and his useless [Gustcloak Runner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Runner). Due to the fact he couldn't get rid of the [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) Raphael wasn't able to really force a lot of damage through and Eivind kept the beats going with his [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion). He didn't want to wait any longer and give Raphael any outs so he just cast [Tribal Unity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribal+Unity) for four, naming Elves and swung with his team of three Elves and Raphael had to pick up his cards.

1-0 Eivind Nitter

### Game 2

Raphael decided to start again and this time kept his opening 7. Raphael played a turn 2 [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) and a turn 3 [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) and a [Goblin Taskmaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Taskmaster)... who says this is a slow format. When Raphael attacked with his team Eivind blocked a Seeker with his [Snarling Undorak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snarling+Undorak). Raphael had a trick in Pity Charm. [Prowling Pangolin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prowling+Pangolin) removed two little beaters but Eivind still couldn't handle the horde of creatures Raphael had at that point. 

1-1

### Game 3

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop02/a875.jpg)Now it was Eivind's time to start and he gladly accepted after the beating he received last game.

No mulligans again and Raphael had his turn 1 [Gustcloak Runner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Runner). Like game 1 he attacked turn 2 and again Eivind blocked with his [Wirewood Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Herald); of course Raphael removed his Runner from combat once again. After the usual amount of small dorks from Raphael's side Eivind laid [Silklash Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silklash+Spider) which probably has enough toughness to hold back Raphael's entire deck on his own. He also added a turn 7 [Krosan Tusker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker) and things were starting to look grim for Raphael. When it attacked next turn Raphael gang blocked with three creatures but when Eivind just played a [Cruel Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival) to remove one of the blockers so the Tusker stayed alive and all the dorks died. At this point even [Insurrection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insurrection) wouldn't have helped Raphael anymore because Eivind would be able to kill two of his own guys with the [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) and [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) he was holding. 

**Final Result:** Eivind Nitter 2-1 over Raphael Levy
