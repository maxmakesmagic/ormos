The seventh round is the first hurdle for an undefeated player. Victory means locking up Day 2. Defeat means frustration, stress, and visions of impending doom.




**The Players**



Oregon’s Timothy Muller joined his playgroup in their long-weekend trek up to the GP. Originally having settled on Hall of Famer Raph Levy’s Loam-Pox deck, its performance in Friday trials left Muller dissatisfied. He made an audible to Abzan, and is sitting at a comfortable 6-0.



Channel Fireball’s own Paul “PAUL” Cheon has been on a rollercoaster lately. He went from the dizzying high of taking home the trophy at Grand Prix San Jose with his Pork Bun Oath teammates Eric Froehlich and Luis Scott-Vargas, which had the added benefit of qualifying him for Pro Tour Fate Reforged as a Silver Pro Club Member, to the gut-churning drop of a dismal result there. Now he’s back to his winning ways, and looking to repeat the efforts that made him the 2008 Grand Prix Vancouver champion.




**The Games**



Cheon couldn’t keep his opening seven, but his six were acceptable. Muller kicked things off with [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) and [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) while Cheon smoothed his draw with [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions). Cheon added [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) to his board and passed. Muller hit for three and brought out [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Cheon went for another [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), and [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) sent the Lavamancer packing before it would have enough fuel. Cheon had a replacement, but he didn’t have a third land.



Muller wasn’t going to give him much chance to recover. He brought out [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township) and boosted his squad, hitting for seven. Cheon took one more turn and then decided to move on to the next game.

The second game kept a more sedate pace. An early [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) for Muller took out [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), and then he fed a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) into Cheon’s [Flame Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash). That let him delve out the mighty [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang). However, Cheon had drawn a nice one. He tapped four and brought out [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation), stealing the legend.



Muller had no immediate answer and so brought out a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). Cheon tapped three and lowered the boom – [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon). That knocked Muller back to just a single source of green. He threw out a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) as a speedbump but with no way to get back his Tasigur his fate was sealed. Soon he was shuffling up for game three.

Muller opened with [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and attacked with it as an anemic 1/2. Cheon was happy to trade a Snapcaster for it before it could get out of hand. He untapped and again brought down [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon). Muller was able to fetch out a forest to go with his basic plains, but had no source of black mana. He was locked out of his hand of [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s and Tasigur.



Cheon wasted no time bringing down [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull). Muller’s deck did him no favors, and between burn and [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), it was a short road to victory for Cheon.
