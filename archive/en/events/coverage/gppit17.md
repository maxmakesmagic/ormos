GRAND PRIX PITTSBURGH 2017

DAY 1 COVERAGE




 Good morning from a warm Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania! Well, relatively warm for this time of year. Let's say "seasonably." And it's especially seasonable compared to Dublin, Ireland, where many of these players were just last weekend at Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*! About 1,400 people traveled to the convention center in Pittsburgh clash into each other until they've ground down to one winner.



This weekend is the first post-Pro Tour Grand Prix, and it will be amazing to see where the format is headed after a certain dark-horse deck barreled down the stretch to take the checkered flag. Mardu Vehicles was not expected to do as well as it did—putting six (SIX!) players into the Top 8—and now it's got the target on its back. Though the vehicles deck is full of Nos-fueled power, the cards are quite beatable. Let's see what the players bring to beat them.


Will the Copycat combo live up to its potential? Saheeli Rai and Felidar Guardian make a potent mix. Is there room for a good control deck? And if so, what colors—Grixis? Sultai? Or will the Black-Green monsters devour everything? The Black-Green decks have Winding Constrictor and just about everything that combines with it. The +1/+1 counters and loyalty counters get crazy and quickly.


Always remember, the Pro Tour is just the start of the race to determine the Standard metagame—there's always legs to travel. Mardu Vehicles began this lap as the leader, but much of the race is yet to be run!


By this weekend, we'll see where the Standard metagame veers next.
