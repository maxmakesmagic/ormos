While Nate Price has the full story on the match between Hall of Famer Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa and Sebastian Martinez, here is a recap of what went on in the other Quarterfinal matches. 



**Fernando Pietragallo vs. Demian Tejo**




 Pietragallo's removal stifled any early offerings from Tejo, leaving the Mono-Blue Devotion player with two [Cloudfin Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudfin+Raptor)s at 0/1 while Pietragallo mounted an offense. Out of desperation, Tejo woke up [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and aimed [Rapid Hybridization](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rapid+Hybridization) at it to try and evolve his creatures. However, [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) shut that plan down, cementing Pietragallo's lead. Tejo found a reprieve in a freshly drawn [Master of Waves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves), which helped turn the tides, buying Tejo a chance and a much needed breather. When Pietragallo was unable to force through any damage with his opponent at 1, Tejo was able to surmount a big enough offense to steal away the first game.
