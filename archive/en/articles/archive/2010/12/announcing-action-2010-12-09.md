**Magic**'s May 2011 small set, code-named "Action," is called ... something we're not going to tell you yet.


Here's the deal: Right now, Mirrodin is the site of a war between the Mirrans and the Phyrexians. And one of those sides is going to win. But we don't want to reveal the winner just yet. So we can tell you that the third set in the *Scars of Mirrodin* Block is going to be either *Mirrodin Pure* or *New Phyrexia*.
