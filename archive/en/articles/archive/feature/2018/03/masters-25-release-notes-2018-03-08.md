The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.CustHelp.com](http://wizards.custhelp.com/).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.




---

GENERAL NOTES
=============


**What is *Masters 25*?**


*Masters 25* takes players on a celebratory tour through some of the most powerful cards in all 25 years of *Magic* history. The set includes fan favorites from each and every black-bordered set, from *Limited Edition (Alpha)* through *Rivals of Ixalan*. *Masters 25* is designed to provide an exciting and unique Limited experience with cards that have never been drafted together.


Release Information
===================


The *Masters 25* set contains 249 cards (101 common, 80 uncommon, 53 rare, and 15 mythic rare).


Release date: March 16, 2018


Go to [Wizards.com/Locator](http://www.wizards.com/locator) to find an event or store near you.


Format Legality
===============


Inclusion in the *Masters 25* set doesn't change what other formats a card is legal in. The majority of its cards are not legal in the Standard format, and many are not legal in the Modern format.


Go to [Magic.Wizards.com/Rules](http://magic.wizards.com/rules) for a complete list of formats and permitted card sets.




---

Expansion Symbol Icons
======================


Cards in the *Masters 25* set have an expansion symbol icon in their text boxes to commemorate the first set in which they were printed. These icons have no effect on gameplay. If you encounter an expansion symbol that you're not familiar with, you can find it among the card's printings at [Gatherer.Wizards.com](http://gatherer.wizards.com/).




---

Returning Mechanics
===================


All cards in the *Masters 25* set have previously appeared in other *Magic* sets. Accordingly, several keywords and other mechanics make their return. None of the rules regarding these mechanics have changed since they last appeared.




---

Cycling and Typecycling
=======================


Appearing in several sets, most recently the *Amonkhet* block, cycling is a mechanic that lets you exchange certain cards for something you might want more.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_0T34RZohBk.png)


Unearth  

B  

Sorcery  

Return target creature card with converted mana cost 3 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield.  

Cycling 2 *(2, Discard this card: Draw a card.)*


The typecycling variant on cycling goes one step further, allowing you to search your library for what you need. Five cards in the *Masters 25* set have a typecycling ability for one of the five basic land types—when you cycle one of these cards, you'll get one of those lands instead of drawing a card. A sixth card lets you search for any basic land card.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_6v8NjTIKxr.png)


Ash Barrens  

Land  

T: Add C to your mana pool.  

Basic landcycling 1 *(1, Discard this card: Search your library for a basic land card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.)*


* Anything that interacts with cycling interacts with typecycling as well. Typecycling is a cycling ability, and its cost is a cycling cost.
* Some cards with cycling have an ability that triggers when you cycle them, and some cards have an ability that triggers whenever you cycle any card. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
* Triggered abilities from cycling a card and the cycling ability itself aren't spells. Effects that interact with spells (such as that of Cancel) won't affect them.
* You can cycle a card even if it has a triggered ability from cycling that won't have a legal target. This is because the cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. This also means that if either ability is countered (with Disallow, for example, or if the triggered ability's targets have become illegal), the other ability will still resolve.
* Swampcycling lets you find any card with the Swamp subtype, including nonbasic land cards. The same is true for the other four typecycling abilities for a basic land type. Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, Twilight Mire is neither a Swamp nor a Forest, while Overgrown Tomb is both.



---

Morph and Megamorph
===================


The morph keyword has turned up a few times throughout the years, most recently in the *Khans of Tarkir* block, to hide the true identity of permanents until you decide the time is right to reveal them.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_5sqNiHeReE.png)


Skirk Commando  

1RR  

Creature — Goblin  

2/1  

Whenever Skirk Commando deals combat damage to a player, you may have it deal 2 damage to target creature that player controls.  

Morph 2R *(You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for 3. Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)*


The megamorph variant rewards you and your creature for this effort with a +1/+1 counter after it's turned face up.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_larMxNi5Ep.png)


Ainok Survivalist  

1G  

Creature — Hound Shaman  

2/1  

Megamorph 1G *(You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for 3. Turn it face up any time for its megamorph cost and put a +1/+1 counter on it.)*  

When Ainok Survivalist is turned face up, destroy target artifact or enchantment an opponent controls.


* Anything that interacts with morph interacts with megamorph as well. Megamorph is a morph ability, and its cost is a morph cost.
* A morph ability lets you cast a card face down by paying 3. It then also lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
* The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay 3. This is an alternative cost.
* When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.
* At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can't look at face-down spells or permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
* Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
* If a creature with megamorph is turned face up for its megamorph cost, you put a +1/+1 counter on it as it's turned face up. This doesn't use the stack.
* If a face-down creature with megamorph is turned face up some other way, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on it.
* If a face-down creature loses its abilities, it can't be turned face up because it no longer has a morph ability (or a morph cost).
* Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
* Because face-down creatures don't have a name, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
* A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected unless the new characteristics of the object change the legality of those targets or attachments.
* Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
* If a face-down spell leaves the stack and goes to any zone other than the battlefield (if it was countered, for example), you must reveal it. Similarly, if a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
* You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.



---

Protection
==========


Protection is an ability that appeared regularly in *Magic* sets in the past. It encompasses four different ways to render a permanent safe from other objects.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_q8nMeYqAC0.png)


Ihsan's Shade  

3BBB  

Legendary Creature — Shade Knight  

5/5  

Protection from white


* If a permanent has protection from a color, it means four things:
	+ Damage that would be dealt to that permanent by a source of that color is prevented;
	+ Auras and Equipment of that color can't be attached to that permanent;
	+ Creatures of that color can't block that permanent; and
	+ That permanent can't be the target of spells of that color or abilities of sources of that color.
* Nothing other than the specified events is prevented or illegal. A creature with protection from white is destroyed by Akroma's Vengeance; a creature with protection from black will get -1/-1 from the effect of Death's-Head Buzzard; and a creature with protection from red gains menace from Goblin War Drums.
* A permanent gaining protection may cause a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability is countered and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.
* Some cards grant protection from "a color of your choice." You can't choose "artifact" or "colorless" this way, since those are not colors.



---

Regenerate
==========


Some creatures won't just give up so easily. Regenerate is a keyword action that spares a creature from destruction.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_30pTvAs4DM.png)


Ghost Ship  

2UU  

Creature—Spirit  

2/4  

Flying  

UUU: Regenerate Ghost Ship.


* When you regenerate a permanent, you're creating a replacement effect "shield" to be used later. That effect means "The next time [that permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and tap it. If it's an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat."
* A permanent can regenerate even if it's already tapped.
* A permanent that regenerates doesn't leave or enter the battlefield. Abilities that trigger on a creature dying or entering the battlefield won't trigger if a creature regenerates.
* Permanents are destroyed by effects that use the word "destroy." Creatures are also destroyed by having lethal damage marked on them. Sacrificing a permanent doesn't destroy it, nor does reducing a creature's toughness to 0.
* If a permanent would be destroyed in two ways at once, one regeneration shield protects it from both. This will happen, for example, if a creature with deathtouch deals damage to another creature that's greater than or equal to that creature's toughness.



---

CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES
===================


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_RjFxUqbic3.png)


Accumulated Knowledge  

1U  

Instant  

Draw a card, then draw cards equal to the number of cards named Accumulated Knowledge in all graveyards.


* Because Accumulated Knowledge is still on the stack as you perform its instructions, it isn't in your graveyard and won't add to the number of cards drawn.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_tq9XV9lUqW.png)


Act of Heroism  

1W  

Instant  

Untap target creature. It gets +2/+2 until end of turn and can block an additional creature this turn.


* You can cast Act of Heroism even if the target creature won't be able to block right away, perhaps because you're the attacking player.
* Untapping an attacking creature doesn't remove it from combat.
* Act of Heroism can target an untapped creature. It still gets +2/+2 and can block an additional creature.
* The effects of Act of Heroism are cumulative. If multiples resolve targeting the same creature, that creature can block that many additional creatures this turn.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_q2sQ9r2jfm.png)


Akroma, Angel of Wrath  

5WWW  

Legendary Creature — Angel  

6/6  

Flying, first strike, vigilance, trample, haste, protection from black and from red


* The "legend rule" cares about legendary permanents with the exact same English name. You can control Akroma, Angel of Wrath and Akroma, Angel of Fury at the same time.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_3jmB2fRzVu.png)


Akroma, Angel of Fury  

5RRR  

Legendary Creature — Angel  

6/6  

Akroma, Angel of Fury can't be countered.  

Flying, trample, protection from white and from blue  

R: Akroma, Angel of Fury gets +1/+0 until end of turn.  

Morph 3RRR *(You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for 3. Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)*


* The "legend rule" cares about legendary permanents with the exact same English name. You can control Akroma, Angel of Fury and Akroma, Angel of Wrath at the same time.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_tEJ1txR9nf.png)


Animar, Soul of Elements  

URG  

Legendary Creature — Elemental  

1/1  

Protection from white and from black  

Whenever you cast a creature spell, put a +1/+1 counter on Animar, Soul of Elements.  

Creature spells you cast cost 1 less to cast for each +1/+1 counter on Animar.


* Animar's triggered ability triggers only when a creature spell is cast, after costs are paid. The counter put on Animar for a creature spell won't affect the cost of that creature spell, only future ones.
* Animar's triggered ability resolves before the creature spell that causes it to trigger. The ability will resolve even if that spell is countered.
* To determine the total cost of a creature spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the creature remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_5UEmL9ZA8l.png)


Assembly-Worker  

3  

Artifact Creature — Assembly-Worker  

2/2  

T: Target Assembly-Worker creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.


* Assembly-Worker's ability can target any creature with the Assembly-Worker subtype, not only creatures named Assembly-Worker.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_nMwHFLNJhs.png)


Azusa, Lost but Seeking  

2G  

Legendary Creature — Human Monk  

1/2  

You may play two additional lands on each of your turns.


* Azusa's ability is cumulative with other effects that allow you to play additional lands, such as that of Wayward Swordtooth (from the *Rivals of Ixalan* set).



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_5pzkHxavIS.png)


Bident of Thassa  

2UU  

Legendary Enchantment Artifact  

Whenever a creature you control deals combat damage to a player, you may draw a card.  

1U, T: Creatures your opponents control attack this turn if able.


* The controller of each attacking creature still chooses which player or planeswalker that creature attacks.
* If a creature can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped or having come under that player's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_NwRMUdEhR4.png)


Blood Moon  

2R  

Enchantment  

Nonbasic lands are Mountains.


* Nonbasic lands will lose any other land types and abilities they had. They will gain the land type Mountain and gain the ability "T: Add R to your mana pool."
* Blood Moon's effect doesn't affect names or supertypes. It won't turn any land into a basic land or remove the legendary supertype from a legendary land, and the lands won't be named "Mountain."
* If a nonbasic land has an ability that triggers "when" it enters the battlefield, it will lose that ability before it triggers.
* If a nonbasic land has an ability that causes it to enter the battlefield tapped, it will lose that ability before it applies. The same is also true of any other abilities that modify how a land enters the battlefield or apply "as" a land enters the battlefield, such as the first ability of Cavern of Souls.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_XIj0IF2cbn.png)


Blue Sun's Zenith  

XUUU  

Instant  

Target player draws X cards. Shuffle Blue Sun's Zenith into its owner's library.


* If Blue Sun's Zenith is countered, none of its effects occur. In particular, it will go to its owner's graveyard rather than to its owner's library.
* Because you follow the spell's instructions in order, you won't be able to draw the same Blue Sun's Zenith that you cast.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_4e2o6All7e.png)


Brainstorm  

U  

Instant  

Draw three cards, then put two cards from your hand on top of your library in any order.


* You draw three cards and put two cards back all while Brainstorm is resolving. Nothing can happen between the two, and no player may choose to take actions.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_0e1HdnQqWr.png)


Brine Elemental  

4UU  

Creature — Elemental  

5/4  

Morph 5UU *(You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for 3. Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)*  

When Brine Elemental is turned face up, each opponent skips his or her next untap step.


* Skipping your "next" untap step is cumulative. If a player turns two Brine Elementals face up on the same turn, that player's opponents will each skip their next two untap steps.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_XbuClWDJBL.png)


Brion Stoutarm  

2RW  

Legendary Creature — Giant Warrior  

4/4  

Lifelink  

R, T, Sacrifice another creature: Brion Stoutarm deals damage equal to the sacrificed creature's power to target player.


* If Brion Stoutarm leaves the battlefield after its ability has been activated but before it resolves, the game uses its last known information to determine that it had lifelink and you'll gain life for the damage it deals.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_HhB4vc1gpa.png)


Chalice of the Void  

XX  

Artifact  

Chalice of the Void enters the battlefield with X charge counters on it.  

Whenever a player casts a spell with converted mana cost equal to the number of charge counters on Chalice of the Void, counter that spell.


* A mana cost of XX means that you pay twice X. If you want X to be 3, you pay 6 to cast Chalice of the Void.
* The number of counters on Chalice of the Void matters only at the time the spell is cast. Changing the number of charge counters on Chalice of the Void after a spell has been cast won't change whether the ability counters the spell.
* If there are zero charge counters on Chalice of the Void, it counters each spell with a converted mana cost of 0. This includes face-down creature spells cast with morph's alternative cost.
* Chalice of the Void has to be on the battlefield at the end of casting a spell for the ability to trigger. If you sacrifice Chalice of the Void as a cost to cast a spell, its ability can't trigger. However, if it leaves the battlefield once its ability has triggered, that ability will still counter the spell.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_G350eqF6LL.png)


Chandra's Outrage  

2RR  

Instant  

Chandra's Outrage deals 4 damage to target creature and 2 damage to that creature's controller.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Chandra's Outrage resolves, the spell is countered. No player is dealt damage.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_qUjwauPd6F.png)


Cloudshift  

W  

Instant  

Exile target creature you control, then return that card to the battlefield under your control.


* Once the exiled permanent returns, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
* The returned card won't be the target of any spells or abilities that targeted it before. Any spells that don't target, such as Akroma's Vengeance, will still affect it.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
* When an effect returns the exiled card "under your control," you control it indefinitely after that. In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any creatures you control from Cloudshift's effect are exiled.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_7D50XpuZhh.png)


Coalition Relic  

3  

Artifact  

T: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.  

T: Put a charge counter on Coalition Relic.  

At the beginning of your precombat main phase, remove all charge counters from Coalition Relic. Add one mana of any color to your mana pool for each charge counter removed this way.


* If you remove multiple charge counters from Coalition Relic at once, you may add a different color of mana to your mana pool for each one.
* Only the first main phase each turn is considered a precombat main phase, even if other main phases or combat phases are created (with Relentless Assault, for example).



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_6jpNeAAwsP.png)


Conflux  

3WUBRG  

Sorcery  

Search your library for a white card, a blue card, a black card, a red card, and a green card. Reveal those cards and put them into your hand. Then shuffle your library.


* You don't have to find all five cards.
* You may find multicolored cards with Conflux. The white card you find, for example, can be any number of colors, as long as white is one of them. What colors it is won't impact what other cards you can find. For example, you may find a white-blue card as the white card and another white-blue card as the blue card.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_73uTixUAgd.png)


Coralhelm Guide  

1U  

Creature — Merfolk Scout Ally  

2/1  

4U: Target creature can't be blocked this turn.


* Activating Coralhelm Guide's ability after a creature has become blocked won't cause that creature to become unblocked.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_jdQL9QMxJU.png)


Courser of Kruphix  

1GG  

Enchantment Creature — Centaur  

2/4  

Play with the top card of your library revealed.  

You may play the top card of your library if it's a land card.  

Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you gain 1 life.


* While playing with the top card of your library revealed, if you draw multiple cards, reveal each one before you draw it. If you put multiple cards on top of your library at once, reveal only the one new top card.
* If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, you don't reveal the new top card until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability.
* Courser of Kruphix doesn't change when you can play lands. You can do so only during your main phase when you have priority and the stack is empty.
* Playing a land from the top of your library counts as your land play for the turn. Once you play a land during your turn, you won't be able to play an additional land from the top of your library unless another effect (such as that of Azusa, Lost but Seeking) allows you to.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_jfIEA49WyW.png)


Court Hussar  

2U  

Creature — Vedalken Knight  

1/3  

Vigilance  

When Court Hussar enters the battlefield, look at the top three cards of your library, then put one of them into your hand and the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.  

When Court Hussar enters the battlefield, sacrifice it unless W was spent to cast it.


* If Court Hussar enters the battlefield in a way other than being cast as a spell, then W can't have been spent to cast it, and you'll have to sacrifice it.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_mgQES3yc0D.png)


Curiosity  

U  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

Whenever enchanted creature deals damage to an opponent, you may draw a card.


* You draw one card each time the enchanted creature deals damage to an opponent, no matter how much damage it deals or whether it was dealt in combat.
* If Curiosity enchants an opponent's creature, you won't draw a card when that creature damages you. The creature has to deal damage to one of your opponents for Curiosity's ability to trigger.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_HjQcRpeHbz.png)


Darien, King of Kjeldor  

4WW  

Legendary Creature — Human Soldier  

3/3  

Whenever you're dealt damage, you may create that many 1/1 white Soldier creature tokens.


* If you're dealt damage that causes your life total to become 0 or less, you lose the game before the tokens can be created.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_3od07Qgm5D.png)


Deadly Designs  

1B  

Enchantment  

2: Put a plot counter on Deadly Designs. Any player may activate this ability.  

When there are five or more plot counters on Deadly Designs, sacrifice it. If you do, destroy up to two target creatures.


* You control the last ability of Deadly Designs, no matter who activated the ability to give it its fifth plot counter.
* You must sacrifice Deadly Designs as its last ability resolves. However, you can choose zero creatures as targets if you want.
* If the player who controlled Deadly Designs as its last ability triggered doesn't control it as that ability resolves, Deadly Designs won't be sacrificed. The same is true if each of the ability's targets are all illegal by the time the ability resolves. However, if it's still on the battlefield and has five or more plot counters on it, its last ability will immediately trigger again.

Death's-Head Buzzard  

1BB  

Creature — Bird

Cycling 2W *(2W, Discard this card: Draw a card.)*

Echoing Courage  

1G  

Instant  

Target creature and all other creatures with the same name as that creature get +2/+2 until end of turn.


* Echoing Courage has only one target. Other creatures with that name are not targeted. For example, a creature with protection from green will still get +2/+2 if it has the same name as the target creature.
* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Echoing Courage tries to resolve, the spell is countered. No creatures get +2/+2.
* The name of a creature token is the same as the creature types it was created with, unless the token is a copy of another creature or the effect that created the token specifically gave it a different name. For example, a 1/1 Cat Soldier creature token is named "Cat Soldier."
* A face-down creature has no name, so it can't share a name with anything. This includes other creatures with no name.

Eidolon of the Great Revel  

RR  

Enchantment Creature — Spirit  

2/2  

Whenever a player casts a spell with converted mana cost 3 or less, Eidolon of the Great Revel deals 2 damage to that player.


* Casting Eidolon of the Great Revel doesn't cause its own ability to trigger. It must be on the battlefield when the spell is cast for its ability to trigger.
* The amount of mana spent to cast a spell doesn't change its converted mana cost. For example, a card cast with its morph ability has a converted mana cost of 0 even though 3 was paid.
* The converted mana cost of a spell with X in its mana cost includes the value chosen for X.

Artifact  

Creatures with power greater than the number of cards in your hand can't attack.


* Ensnaring Bridge's effect checks the number of cards in your hand only while a player (including you) is declaring attackers. Once a creature has legally attacked, changing its power or the number of cards in your hand won't remove it from combat.

Enthralling Victor  

3R  

Creature — Human Warrior  

3/2  

When Enthralling Victor enters the battlefield, gain control of target creature an opponent controls with power 2 or less until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn.


* Once Enthralling Victor's ability resolves and you gain control of a creature, raising its power above 2 won't cause you to lose control of it. Similarly, it doesn't matter if Enthralling Victor leaves the battlefield or you lose control of Enthralling Victor. You'll keep control of the creature that was the target of the ability until the end of the turn.
* Enthralling Victor's ability can target a creature that's already untapped. You'll still gain control of it and it will gain haste.

Target creature you control gets +1/+2 until end of turn. It fights target creature you don't control.


* You can't cast Epic Confrontation unless you choose both a creature you control and a creature you don't control as targets.
* If the creature you control is an illegal target as Epic Confrontation tries to resolve, the creature you control won't get +1/+2. If that creature is a legal target but the creature you don't control isn't, your creature will still get +1/+2. In both cases, neither creature will deal or be dealt damage.

Fiend Hunter  

1WW  

Creature — Human Cleric  

1/3  

When Fiend Hunter enters the battlefield, you may exile another target creature.  

When Fiend Hunter leaves the battlefield, return the exiled card to the battlefield under its owner's control.


* If Fiend Hunter leaves the battlefield before its first ability has resolved, its second ability will trigger and do nothing. Then its first ability will resolve and exile the targeted creature indefinitely.
* Once the exiled permanent returns, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
* If a token is exiled this way, it won't return to the battlefield.

Flash  

1U  

Instant  

You may put a creature card from your hand onto the battlefield. If you do, sacrifice it unless you pay its mana cost reduced by up to 2.


* If the creature has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* Only the generic mana in that creature's mana cost is reduced. For example, if that creature's mana cost is 1R, you'll have to pay R to keep it.
* The creature enters the battlefield, so it will trigger enters-the-battlefield abilities even if you choose not to pay.
* If you choose not to pay, the creature is sacrificed immediately. No player will get priority in between the creature entering the battlefield and being sacrificed. Sacrificing the creature this way will trigger any abilities that trigger when it leaves the battlefield, and those abilities will be put onto the stack at the same time as those that triggered when it entered the battlefield.

Fortune Thief

Creature — Human Rogue  

0/1  

Damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.  

Morph RR *(You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for 3. Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)*


* Fortune Thief's effect applies only if your life total is being reduced by damage. Other effects or costs (such as losing or paying life) can reduce your life total below 1 as normal.
* Fortune Thief's effect is not a prevention effect. It stops unpreventable damage from reducing your life total below 1.
* Fortune Thief doesn't change how much damage is dealt; it just changes how much life that damage makes you lose. Abilities such as lifelink will see the full amount of damage being dealt.
* Fortune Thief won't prevent you from losing the game if your life total becomes 0 or less or if some other effect causes you to lose the game.
* If your life total is less than 1 but you've somehow avoided losing the game, Fortune Thief's effect won't apply at all if you're dealt damage.

Enchant Island  

2: Enchanted Island becomes a 3/2 blue Spirit creature with flying until end of turn. It's still a land.  

When enchanted Island is put into a graveyard, you may return Genju of the Falls from your graveyard to your hand.


* A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its T abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of his or her most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
* Activating the ability that turns something into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number. However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.

Gisela, Blade of Goldnight  

4RWW  

Legendary Creature — Angel  

5/5  

Flying, first strike  

If a source would deal damage to an opponent or a permanent an opponent controls, that source deals double that damage to that player or permanent instead.  

If a source would deal damage to you or a permanent you control, prevent half that damage, rounded up.


* Gisela doubles damage dealt to opponents and permanents your opponents control from any source, including sources controlled by those opponents.
* If multiple replacement effects would modify how damage would be dealt, the player being dealt damage (or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage) chooses the order in which to apply those effects.
* If damage dealt by a source you control is being divided or assigned among multiple permanents an opponent controls or among an opponent and one or more permanents he or she controls simultaneously, divide the original amount and double the results. For example, if you attack with a 5/5 creature with trample and your opponent blocks with a 2/2 creature, you can assign 2 damage to the blocker and 3 damage to the defending player. These amounts are then doubled to 4 and 6 damage, respectively. You can't double the damage to 10 first and then assign 2 to the creature and 8 to the player.

Grenzo, Dungeon Warden enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it.  

2: Put the bottom card of your library into your graveyard. If it's a creature card with power less than or equal to Grenzo's power, put it onto the battlefield.


* Compare Grenzo's power when the ability resolves with the power of the creature card in your graveyard to determine if you put it onto the battlefield. If Grenzo isn't on the battlefield at this time, use its last known power from when it was on the battlefield.
* If the card you put into your graveyard isn't a creature card or it's a creature card with power greater than Grenzo's power, it stays in your graveyard.

* The creature card returned to your hand is chosen at random as the ability resolves. If any player responds to the ability, that player won't yet know what card will be returned.
* Because Haunted Fengraf's ability doesn't target any creature card, any creature card put into the graveyard in response to that ability may be returned to your hand.
* All players get to see which card you return to your hand.

Artifact — Equipment  

Equipped creature doesn't untap during its controller's untap step.  

Equipped creature has "T: This creature deals 2 damage to target creature or player."  

Equip 4


* The equipped creature is the source of both the damage ability and the resultant damage, not Heavy Arbalest. For example, if Heavy Arbalest equips a green creature, the ability can target a creature with protection from artifacts but not one with protection from green.
* The creature that doesn't untap during its controller's untap step is the one that Heavy Arbalest is equipped to as that untap step begins. If a creature was tapped to activate the ability granted to it by the Arbalest, but the Arbalest is no longer equipping it, it will untap as normal.

* Hell's Caretaker can be the creature sacrificed to activate its ability, but it can't be the target of its own ability.
* The upkeep step is before the draw step, after the untap step. Because the turn has already begun, creatures put onto the battlefield during your upkeep won't be able to attack or pay a T cost this turn.

* If Humble Defector isn't on the battlefield as its ability resolves, but the target player is still a legal target, the ability will resolve. You'll draw two cards, even though the player won't gain control of Humble Defector.
* If Humble Defector is controlled by a player other than its owner, and its controller leaves the game, the effect giving that player control of Humble Defector ends. Humble Defector will return to the control of the player still in the game who most recently controlled it.
* If Humble Defector's owner leaves the game, Humble Defector not-so-humbly leaves the game along with that player.

If you control a Forest, rather than pay Invigorate's mana cost, you may have an opponent gain 3 life.  

Target creature gets +4/+4 until end of turn.


* If an effect says that an opponent can't gain life, you can't have that player gain life to pay Invigorate's alternative cost. If an effect instead replaces life gain, such as the effect of Sulfuric Vortex, you may choose to pay the cost even though the cost's action is replaced with nothing.

Menace  

Megamorph R *(You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for 3. Turn it face up any time for its megamorph cost and put a +1/+1 counter on it.)*  

When Ire Shaman is turned face up, exile the top card of your library. Until end of turn, you may play that card.


* If a face-down Ire Shaman attacks and is blocked by one creature, turning it face up won't cause it to become unblocked.
* The card exiled with Ire Shaman's last ability is exiled face up.
* Playing the card exiled with Ire Shaman's last ability follows the normal rules for playing the card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if the card is a creature card, you can cast that card only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
* Under normal circumstances, you can play a land card exiled with Ire Shaman only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
* If you don't play the card, it will remain exiled.

1/3  

Haste  

R, T: Exile target instant or sorcery card from your graveyard.  

1R, T, Sacrifice Izzet Chemister: Cast any number of cards exiled with Izzet Chemister without paying their mana costs.


* The last ability of Izzet Chemister only lets you cast cards exiled by that card. If Izzet Chemister leaves the battlefield before you activate that ability, the exiled cards are lost forever.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, those must be paid to cast the card.
* If the card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
* You must cast any of the exiled cards you wish to cast while Izzet Chemister's last ability is resolving. You can't cast them later in the turn. A sorcery cast this way will be cast at a time you normally wouldn't be able to.
* You cast the exiled cards one at a time in any order. Later spells can target ones you cast earlier. None of the spells resolve until after you're done casting them all.
* Any of the cards you don't cast will remain exiled.

−1: Return target creature to its owner's hand.  

−12: Exile all cards from target player's library, then that player shuffles his or her hand into his or her library.


* You draw three cards and put two cards back all while Jace's second ability is resolving. Nothing can happen between the two, and no player may choose to take actions.
* If the targeted player for Jace's last ability has no cards in hand, that player shuffles nothing into his or her library, and that player's library will remain empty. That player won't lose the game until he or she tries to draw from the empty library.

2/5  

Morph 3WW *(You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for 3. Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)*  

When Karona's Zealot is turned face up, all damage that would be dealt to it this turn is dealt to target creature instead.


* If the target creature leaves the battlefield or stops being a creature before damage would be dealt, that damage is not redirected. For example, if you choose a 1/1 creature, then Karona's Zealot would be dealt 3 damage, all 3 is dealt instead to the 1/1 creature, which then dies. If Karona's Zealot would be dealt 3 damage again later in the turn, the 1/1 creature is no longer on the battlefield, so the damage is not redirected.
* If multiple replacement effects would modify how damage would be dealt, the player being dealt damage (or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage) chooses the order in which to apply those effects.

Kavu Predator

Creature — Kavu

Whenever an opponent gains life, put that many +1/+1 counters on Kavu Predator.


* Kavu Predator's last ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Kor Firewalker or 6 life from Renewed Faith.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage is a single life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures an opponent controls with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Kavu Predator's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature an opponent controls with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* If an opponent gains an amount of life "for each" of something (such as from Congregate), that life is gained as one event and Kavu Predator's ability triggers only once.

When Laquatus's Champion enters the battlefield, target player loses 6 life.  

When Laquatus's Champion leaves the battlefield, that player gains 6 life.

Each player exiles all creature cards from his or her graveyard, then sacrifices all creatures he or she controls, then puts all cards he or she exiled this way onto the battlefield.


* As Living Death resolves, all players exile their creature cards from graveyards at the same time. Then all players sacrifice all creatures they control at the same time. Then all players put all creatures they exiled onto the battlefield at the same time.
* Only cards exiled by Living Death's first instruction are put onto the battlefield. If a replacement effect (such as that of Leyline of the Void) causes any of the sacrificed creatures to be exiled instead of put into a graveyard, those cards aren't returned to the battlefield.

Luminarch Ascension  

1W  

Enchantment  

At the beginning of each opponent's end step, if you didn't lose life this turn, you may put a quest counter on Luminarch Ascension.  

1W: Create a 4/4 white Angel creature token with flying. Activate this ability only if Luminarch Ascension has four or more quest counters on it.


* Luminarch Ascension's first ability doesn't trigger if you have lost life before an opponent's end step begins. If it does trigger but you lose life before it resolves, it does nothing and you won't put a quest counter on Luminarch Ascension.
* Luminarch Ascension's first ability cares only whether you lost life this turn, even if Luminarch Ascension wasn't on the battlefield when that happened. It doesn't care how much you lost, whether you also gained life, or even whether you gained more life than you lost.
* You can activate Luminarch Ascension's last ability during the end step in which it receives its fourth quest counter.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Luminarch Ascension's first ability will trigger twice at the beginning of the opposing team's end step if you didn't lose life that turn. It doesn't matter whether your teammate lost life or not.

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

Enchanted creature gets +2/+2 and has "1, Sacrifice a permanent: This creature gains flying until end of turn."


* Only the player who controls the enchanted creature can activate the ability it gains from Lunarch Mantle. This might not be the controller of Lunarch Mantle.
* You can activate the ability Lunarch Mantle grants to your enchanted creature by sacrificing any permanent you control, including Lunarch Mantle or the enchanted creature itself. If you sacrifice Lunarch Mantle this way, the creature it previously enchanted still gains flying.

Master of the Wild Hunt  

2GG  

Creature — Human Shaman  

3/3  

At the beginning of your upkeep, create a 2/2 green Wolf creature token.  

T: Tap all untapped Wolf creatures you control. Each Wolf tapped this way deals damage equal to its power to target creature. That creature deals damage equal to its power divided as its controller chooses among any number of those Wolves.


* All Wolves you control are tapped as part of the activated ability's effect, not as a cost. Players may respond by attempting to tap or untap Wolves, or to create or remove them.
* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Master of the Wild Hunt's ability tries to resolve, the ability is countered. You won't tap your Wolves, and nothing will deal or be dealt damage.
* Only a Wolf creature tapped as part of the ability's effect can be dealt damage by the target creature.
* The controller of the target creature doesn't divide that creature's damage as the ability is activated (since the Wolves that will receive that damage aren't targeted), so that player does so as the ability resolves. There is no time to react between the time a Wolf is chosen, the time damage is dealt to it, and the time it's destroyed for having been dealt lethal damage. If you want to put a regeneration shield on one of those Wolves, or target it with a damage-prevention spell, or anything else, you must do so before the ability resolves (and before you know which Wolves will be chosen and how much damage will be dealt to them).

When Mesmeric Fiend enters the battlefield, target opponent reveals his or her hand and you choose a nonland card from it. Exile that card.  

When Mesmeric Fiend leaves the battlefield, return the exiled card to its owner's hand.


* If Mesmeric Fiend leaves the battlefield before its first ability has resolved, its second ability will trigger and do nothing. Then its first ability will resolve and exile a nonland card from the target opponent's hand indefinitely.

Mishra's Factory  

Land  

T: Add C to your mana pool.  

1: Mishra's Factory becomes a 2/2 Assembly-Worker artifact creature until end of turn. It's still a land.  

T: Target Assembly-Worker creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.


* A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its T abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of his or her most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
* Activating the ability that turns something into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number. However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.
* Once turned into a creature, Mishra's Factory's last ability can target itself. If it's already blocking, this won't remove it from combat.

Mogg Flunkies  

1R  

Creature — Goblin  

3/3  

Mogg Flunkies can't attack or block alone.


* If you control more than one Mogg Flunkies, they can attack or block together, even if no other creatures attack or block.
* Although Mogg Flunkies can't attack alone, other attacking creatures don't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, Mogg Flunkies could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls. Similarly, other blocking creatures don't have to block the same creature that Mogg Flunkies blocks.
* Once Mogg Flunkies has attacked or blocked, it will remain in combat even if you no longer control another attacking or blocking creature.
* If an effect says that Mogg Flunkies attacks or blocks if able and you control another creature able to attack or block, you must attack or block with Mogg Flunkies and that creature.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Mogg Flunkies can attack or block with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control are attacking or blocking.

Legendary Creature — Dragon Wizard  

4/4  

Flying  

Whenever you draw a card, Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind deals 1 damage to target creature or player.  

T: Draw a card.


* If a spell or ability causes you to draw multiple cards, Niv-Mizzet's ability triggers that many times.
* If dealing 1 damage to a creature or player causes you to draw a card, perhaps because Niv-Mizzet is enchanted by Curiosity, you'll continue this loop until the loop is interrupted, perhaps by a player losing the game.

Notion Thief  

2UB  

Creature — Human Rogue  

3/1  

Flash  

If an opponent would draw a card except the first one he or she draws in each of his or her draw steps, instead that player skips that draw and you draw a card.


* If an opponent is instructed to draw a card then discard a card, and Notion Thief causes you to draw a card instead, that opponent still discards a card. The same is true of any other actions that opponent is instructed to do.
* If two or more players each control a Notion Thief and a player would draw a card other than the first one in his or her draw step, that player chooses one of the applicable Notion Thief effects to apply. Then the player whose Notion Thief's effect was chosen repeats this process among the remaining Notion Thief effects, and so on, until there are no more possible such effects to apply. Each effect can be applied to the card draw only once this way.
* The above procedure means that if each player in a two-player game controls a Notion Thief and one would draw a card, it really will be that player who draws a card.

Whenever enchanted creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on it. Then if it has three or more +1/+1 counters on it, sacrifice Ordeal of Heliod.  

When you sacrifice Ordeal of Heliod, you gain 10 life.


* Ordeal of Heliod's first triggered ability resolves before blockers are chosen, well before combat damage is dealt.
* The check of whether the enchanted creature has three or more +1/+1 counters on it happens as part of the resolution of first triggered ability. If the third +1/+1 counter is put on the enchanted creature any other way, you won't sacrifice Ordeal of Heliod until the next time the creature attacks.
* If you sacrifice Ordeal of Heliod in some other way than its own ability, its last ability will trigger.

* If another permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of Primal Clay, the controller of that permanent will get to make a new choice. The copy won't necessarily have the same power, toughness, and abilities as the original.
* If a creature that's already on the battlefield becomes a copy of Primal Clay, it copies the power, toughness, and abilities that were chosen for Primal Clay as it entered the battlefield.

3BRG  

Legendary Creature — Dragon  

5/5  

Flying  

When you cast Prossh, Skyraider of Kher, create X 0/1 red Kobold creature tokens named Kobolds of Kher Keep, where X is the amount of mana spent to cast Prossh.  

Sacrifice another creature: Prossh gets +1/+0 until end of turn.


* The amount of mana you spent to cast Prossh is usually equal to its converted mana cost. However, you also include any cost reductions and additional costs you pay, including the cost imposed for casting your commander from the command zone in the Commander variant.
* You can't choose to pay extra mana to cast a creature spell unless something instructs you to.
* Prossh's first ability triggers when Prossh is cast and resolves before Prossh does. That ability will resolve even if Prossh is countered.

Enchant creature  

Enchanted creature gets +2/+0 and has trample.  

When Rancor is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, return Rancor to its owner's hand.

Rest in Peace  

1W  

Enchantment  

When Rest in Peace enters the battlefield, exile all cards from all graveyards.  

If a card or token would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.


* While Rest in Peace is on the battlefield, abilities that trigger whenever a creature dies won't trigger because cards and tokens are never put into a player's graveyard.
* If Rest in Peace is destroyed by a spell, Rest in Peace will be exiled and then the spell will be put into its owner's graveyard.
* If a card is discarded while Rest in Peace is on the battlefield, abilities that function when a card is discarded (such as madness) still work, even though that card never reaches a graveyard. In addition, spells or abilities that check the characteristics of a discarded card (such as Chandra Ablaze's first ability) can find that card in exile.

Ruric Thar, the Unbowed attacks each combat if able.

* Ruric Thar's triggered ability triggers whenever any player casts a noncreature spell, including you.
* Ruric Thar's triggered ability resolves before the spell that causes it to trigger. The ability will resolve even if that spell is countered.
* If Ruric Thar can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped or having come under that player's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so Ruric Thar doesn't have to attack in that case either.

1R  

Creature — Elemental Shaman  

2/1  

2: Target creature gains trample until end of turn. If this is the third time this ability has resolved this turn, you may add RRRRRRRR to your mana pool.


* You add eight red mana only the third time Soulbright Flamekin's ability resolves in a turn. You won't get the bonus the fourth, fifth, sixth, or any subsequent times in that same turn.
* When Soulbright Flamekin's ability resolves, it counts the number of times that same ability from that same creature has already resolved that turn. A copy of this ability (created by Rings of Brighthearth, for example) will count toward the total. Abilities from other creatures with the same name don't count towards the total. Neither does an ability that's been countered.
* Soulbright Flamekin's ability uses the stack and can be responded to. Because it has a target, it's not a mana ability, even if you know that it will produce mana.

When Stangg enters the battlefield, create a legendary 3/4 red and green Human Warrior creature token named Stangg Twin. Exile that token when Stangg leaves the battlefield. Sacrifice Stangg when that token leaves the battlefield.

Strionic Resonator  

2  

Artifact  

2, T: Copy target triggered ability you control. You may choose new targets for the copy.


* Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]."
* Strionic Resonator targets a triggered ability that has triggered and is on the stack and creates another instance of that ability on the stack. It doesn't cause any object to gain an ability.
* The source of the copy is the same as the source of the original ability.
* If the triggered ability is modal (that is, if it says, "Choose one —" or similar), the mode is copied and can't be changed.
* If the triggered ability divides damage or distributes counters among a number of targets (for example, the ability of Bogardan Hellkite), the division and number of targets can't be changed. If you choose new targets, you must choose the same number of targets.
* Any choices made when the triggered ability resolves won't have been made yet when it's copied. Any such choices will be made separately when the copy resolves. If the triggered ability asks you to pay a cost (such as that of Frenzied Goblin), you pay that cost for the copy.
* If a triggered ability is linked to a second ability, copies of that triggered ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to "the exiled card," it refers to all cards exiled by the triggered ability and the copy. For example, if Fiend Hunter's enters-the-battlefield ability is copied and two creatures are exiled, they both return when Fiend Hunter leaves the battlefield.
* In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about "the exiled card." When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability is copied, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' converted mana costs. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.

Artifact Creature — Golem  

7/10  

When Sundering Titan enters the battlefield or leaves the battlefield, choose a land of each basic land type, then destroy those lands.


* Sundering Titan's ability isn't targeted. When it resolves, Sundering Titan's controller must choose one land for each basic land type (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest), and then they are destroyed simultaneously.
* Players can't take actions in between the time you choose the lands and the time you destroy them. Notably, they can't activate mana abilities of those lands.
* If one of the basic land types isn't present, it isn't chosen. If the only land of a certain type is one you control, you must choose it.
* If a land has more than one basic land type, it can be chosen more than once.

* If a creature enters the battlefield under your control and gains haste, but then loses it before attacking, it won't be able to attack that turn. This means that you can't use one Swiftfoot Boots to allow two new creatures to attack in the same turn.

Swords to Plowshares  

W  

Instant

Thalia, Guardian of Thraben  

1W  

Legendary Creature — Human Soldier  

2/1  

First strike  

Noncreature spells cost 1 more to cast.


* Thalia's ability affects each spell that's not a creature spell, including your own.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.

Thresher Lizard  

2R  

Creature — Lizard  

3/2  

Thresher Lizard gets +1/+2 as long as you have one or fewer cards in hand.


* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Thresher Lizard while you have one or fewer cards in hand may become lethal if cards are put into your hand during that turn.

Timberpack Wolf  

1G  

Creature — Wolf  

2/2  

Timberpack Wolf gets +1/+1 for each other creature you control named Timberpack Wolf.


* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Timberpack Wolf may become lethal if other Timberpack Wolves leave the battlefield during that turn.

Treasure Keeper  

4  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

3/3  

When Treasure Keeper dies, reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a nonland card with converted mana cost 3 or less. You may cast that card without paying its mana cost. Put all revealed cards not cast this way on the bottom of your library in a random order.


* If you don't cast the nonland card with converted mana cost 3 or less, it'll be put on the bottom of your library in a random order with the other cards.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs, such as paying 3 to cast a morph card face down. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Cathartic Reunion, those must be paid to cast the card.
* If the card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
* If your library has no nonland cards in it with converted mana cost 3 or less, you'll reveal all the cards in your library, then put them in a random order. Although this is not technically shuffling your library, no player is allowed to know the order of those cards and you will randomize the cards in your deck.

Tree of Redemption  

3G  

Creature — Plant  

0/13  

Defender  

T: Exchange your life total with Tree of Redemption's toughness.


* If Tree of Redemption isn't on the battlefield when its activated ability resolves, the exchange can't happen and the ability will have no effect.
* When its activated ability resolves, Tree of Redemption's toughness will become your former life total and you will gain or lose an amount of life necessary so that your life total equals Tree of Redemption's former toughness. Other effects that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
* Any toughness-modifying effects, counters, Auras, or Equipment will apply after its toughness is set to your former life total. For example, say Tree of Redemption is enchanted with Lunarch Mantle (which makes it 2/15) and your life total is 7. After the exchange, Tree of Redemption would be a 2/9 creature (its toughness became 7, which was then modified by Lunarch Mantle) and your life total would be 15.

Triskaidekaphobia  

3B  

Enchantment  

At the beginning of your upkeep, choose one —  

• Each player with exactly 13 life loses the game, then each player gains 1 life.  

• Each player with exactly 13 life loses the game, then each player loses 1 life.


* You can choose a mode even if no player will lose the game. Players will still gain or lose life as appropriate.
* If you choose Triskaidekaphobia's second mode and begin to resolve it while an opponent's life total is 13 and your life total is 1, that opponent will lose the game before you lose 1 life.
* If each player has 13 life as Triskaidekaphobia's ability resolves, the game ends in a draw.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team with 13 life loses the game, then each player on each team gains or loses 1 life, causing the team's life total to go up or down by 2.

Twisted Image  

U  

Instant  

Switch target creature's power and toughness until end of turn.  

Draw a card.


* Effects that switch power and toughness apply after all other effects that change power and/or toughness, regardless of which effect was created first.
* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Twisted Image tries to resolve, the spell is countered. You won't draw a card.

Valor in Akros  

3W  

Enchantment  

Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn.


* Valor in Akros's ability affects only creatures you control at the time the ability resolves, including the creature that caused it to trigger. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+1.

Vampire Lacerator  

B  

Creature — Vampire Warrior  

2/2  

At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 1 life unless an opponent has 10 or less life.


* Whether an opponent has 10 or less life is checked only as Vampire Lacerator's ability resolves.

Vesuvan Shapeshifter  

3UU  

Creature — Shapeshifter  

0/0  

As Vesuvan Shapeshifter enters the battlefield or is turned face up, you may choose another creature on the battlefield. If you do, until Vesuvan Shapeshifter is turned face down, it becomes a copy of that creature and gains "At the beginning of your upkeep, you may turn this creature face down."  

Morph 1U


* Vesuvan Shapeshifter's ability to become a copy is a replacement effect. Because turning a creature face up and applying replacement effects both don't use the stack, players won't be able to take actions between the time you announce that you're turning Vesuvan Shapeshifter face up and the time it has become a copy of the creature of your choice.
* Vesuvan Shapeshifter copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* If the chosen creature has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Vesuvan Shapeshifter), then Vesuvan Shapeshifter copies whatever the chosen creature copied.
* If the chosen creature is a token, Vesuvan Shapeshifter copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. Vesuvan Shapeshifter is not a token in this case.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Vesuvan Shapeshifter enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work as it enters the battlefield. Similarly, any "[when/as] [this creature] is turned face up" abilities of the chosen creature will work if Vesuvan Shapeshifter is turned face up.
* If Vesuvan Shapeshifter somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, Vesuvan Shapeshifter can't become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that's already on the battlefield.
* When Vesuvan Shapeshifter is turned face down, its copy effect wears off. While it's face down, it's a 2/2 face-down Vesuvan Shapeshifter that can be turned face up for a morph cost of 1U.
* If another creature copies Vesuvan Shapeshifter while it's face up and copying another creature, the new creature will become a copy of whatever Vesuvan Shapeshifter is copying and gain the "you may turn this creature face down" ability. It won't gain morph 1U. If that creature is then turned face down, its copy effect will continue and it'll be a face-down version of whatever it's copying. If the creature it's copying has morph, it can be turned face up. If the creature it's copying doesn't have morph, it's stuck face down.
* If Vesuvan Shapeshifter copies a face-down creature, it becomes a face-up 2/2 colorless, nameless creature with no abilities other than the one it gives itself.

Whitemane Lion  

1W  

Creature — Cat  

2/2  

Flash  

When Whitemane Lion enters the battlefield, return a creature you control to its owner's hand.


* Whitemane Lion's triggered ability doesn't target any creature. You don't choose what to return until the ability resolves. Once the ability has started to resolve, players can't take actions between choosing the creature and returning it to its owner's hand.
* You may return Whitemane Lion itself to its owner's hand as its triggered ability resolves. If you don't control another creature, you must return it.

Willbender  

1U  

Creature — Human Wizard  

1/2  

Morph 1U *(You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for 3. Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)*  

When Willbender is turned face up, change the target of target spell or ability with a single target.


* You don't choose the new target for the spell until Willbender's triggered ability resolves. You must change the target if possible. However, you can't change the target to an illegal target. If there are no legal targets to choose from, the target isn't changed. It doesn't matter if the original target of that spell has somehow become illegal itself.
* If a spell or ability targets multiple things, you can't target it with Willbender's triggered ability, even if all but one of those targets have become illegal.
* If a spell or ability targets the same player or object multiple times, you can't target it with Willbender's ability.

Zada, Hedron Grinder  

3R  

Legendary Creature — Goblin Ally  

3/3  

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that targets only Zada, Hedron Grinder, copy that spell for each other creature you control that the spell could target. Each copy targets a different one of those creatures.


* Zada's ability triggers whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that targets only Zada and no other object or player.
* If you cast an instant or sorcery spell that has multiple targets, but it's targeting only Zada with all of them, Zada's ability will trigger. The copies will similarly each be targeting only one of your other creatures. You can't change any of the copy's targets to other creatures.
* Any creature you control that couldn't be targeted by the original spell (due to shroud, protection abilities, targeting restrictions, or any other reason) is just ignored by Zada's ability.
* You control all the copies. You choose the order the copies are put onto the stack. The original spell will be on the stack beneath those copies and will resolve last.
* The copies that the ability creates are created on the stack, so they're not cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like Zada's ability itself) won't trigger.
* If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copies will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Rolling Thunder does), the copies have the same value of X.
* The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.

Zoetic Cavern  

Land  

T: Add C to your mana pool.  

Morph 2 *(You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for 3. Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)*


* When Zoetic Cavern is turned face up, any Auras on it that can't legally enchant it will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on it will remain on it.
* If Blood Moon is on the battlefield and a player controls a face-down Zoetic Cavern, it can't be turned face up since it won't have a morph cost.

Zulaport Cutthroat  

1B  

Creature — Human Rogue Ally  

1/1  

Whenever Zulaport Cutthroat or another creature you control dies, each opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.


* If Zulaport Cutthroat dies at the same time as another creature you control, its ability triggers for that creature.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Zulaport Cutthroat's ability causes the opposing team to lose 2 life and you to gain 1 life.
