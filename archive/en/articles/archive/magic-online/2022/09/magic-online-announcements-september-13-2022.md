Take a trip down Dominaria's memory lane with *Time Spiral Remastered* Flashback Draft, available September 14–20. Entry options are 10 Event Tickets or 100 Play Points.


Reminder: Flashback decks are Phantom, so cards drafted are not added to collections.

*Dominaria United* Best-of-One Draft League Ends Thursday
---------------------------------------------------------


For the first time, *Magic Online* is running a Best-of-One Draft League. Until this Thursday, September 15, at 10 a.m. PT (17:00 UTC) join the draft queue and play until you get 7 wins or 3 losses. Full details, including prizes, are found in [the *Dominaria United* article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/dominaria-united-magic-online-edition-2022-08-30#draftleague).


This league is perfect if you only have time for a quick game or two between classes, during lunch, before you head out, or after the kids are asleep. If this is your style, give this league a try before it runs out!

Showcase Challenge Weekends
---------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend.


These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and invitations to the 2023 World Championship!


First up this Saturday, September 17, we have the Modern Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC), and on Sunday, September 18, we have the Pioneer Showcase Challenge at 6 a.m. PT (13:00 UTC).


Then the following week we finish things off on Saturday, September 24, with the Standard Showcase Challenge at 6 a.m. PT (13:00) and on Sunday, September 25, with the Legacy Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (15:00).


Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in December.
