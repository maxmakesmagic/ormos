Boussaud Beats All in Prague
============================




Third time's the charm: Eliott Boussaud ended his third Top 8 with a win, using Black-Red Dragons in Standard to defeat Peter Vieren's Blue-Black Control in the finals to become champion of Grand Prix Prague 2015.

TOP 8 COVERAGE



For most of the weekend, Grand Prix Prague was looking to be a repeat of Grand Prix London which had taken place two weeks prior. For one thing, Hangarback Abzan, if anything, had only increased its market share. And London's champion Fabrizio Anteri had been unbeatable all throughout the first day too!


But if there ever had been a doubt as to the vibrant and ever-changing nature of Standard, this tournament, and its Top 8 in particular, erased it. Yes, Hangarback Abzan was the most-represented deck on Day 2, taking up almost 30 percent of the field, and three of its pilots made it to the quarterfinals. But by the time the finals came around, all Siege Rhinos and all Sandsteppe Citadels had been eliminated. Instead, Belgium's Peter Vieren and France's Eliott Boussaud duked it out, playing Blue-Black Control and Black-Red Dragons respectively.


1,464 players were in the running initially; 178 made it to Day 2; eight gathered in the feature match area for the playoffs; one player stood above them all, claiming the title and trophy: Congratulations to Eliott Boussaud, champion of Grand Prix Prague 2015!

DAY 2 COVERAGE



Welcome back to Day 2 of Grand Prix Prague 2015!


1,464 players had enrolled in the tournament originally, but only 178 managed to reach the requisite score of 7-2 or better to qualify for the second day of the competition. Among them, Fabrizio Anteri, Eliott Boussaud, Rene Petrovic, Felix Brusch, and Mattia Rizzi stood out as the sole players with a pristine record of 9-0. Anteri in particular stood out as he had already won Grand Prix London two weeks prior, playing essentially the same Abzan deck then and now.


The format this weekend once again was Standard Constructed, and while Abzan decks with Hangarback Walkers continued to succeed, and accounted for a full three of the five undefeated players' decks, Standard definitely saw some new developments as well. For instance, White Devotion made a splash already, while Elspeth, Sun's Champion saw a surge in popularity among various deck types and was responsible for a ton of wins across the feature match tables yesterday.


Stay tuned for more stories and more Standard, more decks and more tech, and for the epic conclusion of Grand Prix Prague 2015!

DAY 1 COVERAGE



Day 1 of Grand Prix Prague 2015 concluded in spectacular fashion. All day long we had been following one Fabrizio Anteri's way through the tournament and watched in awe as the three-time Grand Prix champion racked up win after win after win. He entered the event as our King of the Hill based on his win at Grand Prix London two weeks ago, and held on to his title until the very end. Usually, as with real-life monarchy, the King of the Hill feature is a story of succession, this time it was but a story of success.


Joining him in the elite ranks of the undefeated were four other players at 9-0: Eliott Boussaud, Rene Petrovic, Felix Brusch, and Mattia Rizzi. Other big names who made it to the second day were Petr Sochůrek, Ivan Floch, Immanuel Gerschenson, Patrick Dickmann, Hannes Kerem, Andrea Mengucci, Christophe Gregoir, Christian Seibold, and a host of others, so Day 2 was looking rather promising with regards to player power.


As for decks, we've seen an endless procession of Hangarback Walkers, a crash of Siege Rhinos, a surprising amount of White Devotion and Jeskai, and Elspeth, Sun's Champion was the curve topper of choice for a quite a number of these decks.


Check back tomorrow to find out which players and which decks make it to the top here at Grand Prix Prague 2015!

The Top 8 featured five different deck archetypes (Hangarback Abzan, Jeskai, Black-Red Dragons, Blue-Black Control, and Esper Dragons), looking at the full Top 16 added another three (Abzan Control, Red-Green Dragons, and Atarka Red). But all in all, 23 different arc...

Estonian Hannes Kerem might not be a well known name on the Grand Prix scene, but the 27-year-old is in fact National Champion for Estonia for the second year in a row. He has also captained his team to both a Top 8 and a Top 16 finish at the World Magic...
