*This page is for readers whose browsers don't support the technology used in [Mark's original article](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/soldiers-fortune-2003-05-26).*

### The Quiz

**1) What was the first expansion to have a Soldier in it?** 

*Fallen Empires*. The set was all about a series of conflicts. Thus, it had numerous Soldiers. The most important contribution though was that Soldiers were one of the key races for white. This was the beginning of a long history between white and Soldiers.

The reason I started with this question was I wanted to point out how some staples of **Magic** don't go all the way back to the beginning. That said, I should point out that the basic concept of the soldier did go back to Alpha. Except there it was called a Knight and there were just two cards that reflected one another. The reason Knight didn't become the key creature type was that it was a little too limiting. People have a very specific thought of what a knight looks like and it wasn't the kind of concept that you could put on too many cards. But R&D likes the Knight enough that we haven't rolled it into Soldier.

**2) How many colors have had Soldiers?** 

All five. So how'd that happen? The answer lies in the fact that Soldiers are not a race but a class. Races are things like Elf, Goblin or Human. Classes are roles such as Cleric, Wizard, or Soldier. Any race pretty much can be mixed with any class. This is why Soldiers have spread out over time over all the colors. Not equally mind you, but hey that's the next question.

**3) Rank the colors in order from the most Soldiers to the least. (Based on their number in Type I tournament legal expansions.)**

White (by a long shot), blue, red, green, black. This answer surprised me a little when I first saw it. Obviously, white is number one. Blue was near last place until the Aven showed up in *Odyssey*. But a flock of "Bird Soldiers" pushed it up to number two. Red, as the other color of war, comes in at number three. In recent years though we've moved away from red Soldiers as we feel Soldiers implies a sense of order that red doesn't have. Now green beating black was a true surprise. It's only by a few cards, but I just don't associate green with Soldiers. Black's "Soldiers" tend to be Zombies more often than not, thus its role in last place.

**4) What was the first card to have the word "Soldier(s)" in its title? (Hint: It's before *Fallen Empires*.)** 

[Yotian Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier) (in *Antiquities*). The funny thing is that if we printed him today, he would probably be a Soldier, but back then we were very gun shy about giving creature types to artifact creatures.

**5) Following this trend of non-Soldier "soldiers", can you name a blue card with "soldier(s)" in its title that is not a Soldier?**

[Vodalian Soldiers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vodalian+Soldiers) (from *Fallen Empires*). They were Merfolk. Once again under today's creature type philosophy, we probably make them Merfolk Soldiers. Starting with *Odyssey*, we've been much more aggressive about using multiple creature types. (And as *Mirrodin* will demonstrate, this isn't about to change anytime soon.)

**6) How about green? What non-Soldier does it have with "Soldier" in the name?**

[Spike Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Soldier) (from *Stronghold*). It's a Spike. My gut is that today it wouldn't be concepted as a Soldier. The Spikes are a little too unstructured a race to have Soldiers.

**7) How about red? Red has two non-Soldier "Soldiers". Name them.**

[Dwarven Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Soldier) (from *Fallen Empires*) and [Soldier of Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+Fortune) (from *Alliances*). The Dwarf Soldier is obviously a Dwarf while the Soldier of Fortune is a Mercenary. Really. When we made the Mercenary mechanic in *Mercadian Masques*, this is one of the cards we flagged as a previous Mercenary (along with [Rogue Skycaptain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue+Skycaptain)). The Dwarf Soldier today would be a Dwarf Soldier. The Soldier of Fortune would either just be a Soldier or possibly a Mercenary Soldier.

Also, for future trivia sake, I want to point of that [Soldier of Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+Fortune) was one of the few cards I designed in the first set I ever worked on after I started at Wizards.

**8) There have been numerous Soldiers with numerous abilities. Four of the most common keyword abilities are banding, first strike, flying, and protection. Can you put the abilities in order based on how many Soldiers they've appeared on from most to least. (And yes, I'm counting creatures that can activate to give themselves the ability or conditionally can have the ability.)**

The order is: flying (39), first strike (19), banding (10), protection (8). For those that want to see them all (which includes everyone but the guy here that has to code each name [*Thank goodness for macros - Doug B.*]), here you go.

**Flying (39):** 
[Aerial Caravan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aerial+Caravan), [Ascending Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascending+Aven), [Aven Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Archer), [Aven Brigadier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Brigadier), [Aven Cloudchaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser), [Aven Envoy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Envoy), [Aven Farseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Farseer), [Aven Fisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fisher), [Aven Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock), [Aven Liberator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Liberator), [Aven Smokeweaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Smokeweaver), [Aven Trooper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Trooper), [Aven Warhawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Warhawk), [Aven Windreader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Windreader), [Balshan Collaborator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balshan+Collaborator), [Battlewise Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Aven), [Cloudreach Cavalry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudreach+Cavalry), [Coast Watcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coast+Watcher), [Commander Eesha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commander+Eesha), [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber), [Dragonstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstalker), [Gustcloak Harrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier), [Gustcloak Savior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Savior), [Gustcloak Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Skirmisher), [Helionaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helionaut), [Keeneye Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeneye+Aven), [Kjeldoran Skycaptain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Skycaptain), [Kjeldoran Skyknight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Skyknight), [Lieutenant Kirtar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lieutenant+Kirtar), [Major Teroh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Major+Teroh), [Phantom Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Flock), [Possessed Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Possessed+Aven), [Saprazzan Legate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saprazzan+Legate), [Shoreline Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shoreline+Ranger), [Skywing Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywing+Aven), [Soulcatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulcatcher), [Swooping Talon,Treetop Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swooping+Talon%2CTreetop+Sentinel), [Wingbeat Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingbeat+Warrior)

**First strike (19):** 
[Advance Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advance+Scout), [Battlewise Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Aven), [Daru Cavalier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Cavalier), [Daru Lancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Lancer), [Enlistment Officer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlistment+Officer), [Fault Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fault+Rider), [Ication Infantry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ication+Infantry), [Ication Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ication+Scout), [Kjeldoran Phalanx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Phalanx), [Kjeldoran Skycaptain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Skycaptain), [Kjeldoran Skyknight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Skyknight), [Longbow Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longbow+Archer), [Lowland Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lowland+Tracker), [Master of Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Arms), [Ranger en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+en-Vec), [Renegade Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renegade+Warlord), [Sandstone Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandstone+Warrior), [Serra Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Zealot), [Wingbeat Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingbeat+Warrior)

**Banding (10):** 
[Benalish Infantry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Infantry), [Ication Infantry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ication+Infantry), [Ication Phalanx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ication+Phalanx), [Ication Skirmishers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ication+Skirmishers), [Kjeldoran Escort](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Escort), [Kjeldoran Phalanx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Phalanx), [Kjeldoran Skycaptain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Skycaptain), [Kjeldoran Skyknight,Shield Bearer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Skyknight%2CShield+Bearer), [Volunteer Reserves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volunteer+Reserves).

**Protection (8):** 
[Aven Liberator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Liberator), [Aven Smokeweaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Smokeweaver), [Cho-Arrim Legate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cho-Arrim+Legate), [Coast Watcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coast+Watcher), [Commander Eesha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commander+Eesha), [Dragonstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstalker), [Scalebane's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalebane%27s+Elite), [Treetop Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Sentinel)

Flying being first is no real surprise. White is the number two flying color. First strike beat out banding I believe only because we stopped doing banding five years ago. Most impressive is that despite that fact, banding still beat out protection. The major reason for this is that we tend to put protection on Clerics in white. The reason banding is so high is that it was very flavorful on Soldiers. 

**9) How about some of the lesser used keywords? Can you name the two Soldiers that have trample?**

[Gerrard's Irregulars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard%27s+Irregulars) (from *Mercadian Masques*) and [Lancers en-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lancers+en-Kor) (from *Stronghold*). The reason the number is so small is that Soldiers are used primarily in white and white due to its smaller size seldom has trample. 

**10) Can you name the two Soldiers that have haste?**

[Gerrard's Irregulars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard%27s+Irregulars) (from *Mercadian Masques*) and [Whip Sergeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+Sergeant) (from *Prophecy*). If you missed the first one, shame on you. Once again, this keyword appears very little because it isn't used in white.

**11) Can you name the one Soldier with regeneration?**

[Ranger en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+en-Vec) (from *Tempest*). Yeah, this is the guy I picked on in my "[Design 101](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/design-101-2003-04-21-0)" column a month or so back. An interesting little extra bit of trivia. Originally the [Ranger en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+en-Vec) was supposed to have regeneration and banding, but banding was cut as of *Tempest*, so we had to change the ability. (Hmm, maybe that's the excuse I can use.)

**12) I talked about mono-colored Soldiers, but [Ranger en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+en-Vec) brings up the existence of multi-color Soldiers. There are five total. What are the other four?**

[Goblin Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Legionnaire) (*Apocalypse*), [Putrid Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Warrior) (*Apocalypse*), [Scalebane's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalebane%27s+Elite) (*Visions*), and [Soltari Guerillas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Guerillas) (*Tempest*). White/Red, White/Black, White/Green. Where's the White/Blue Soldier? Maybe I'll have to put that in the next set with gold cards. 

**13) Of all expansions every produced (and I mean all the expansions), which one has the most Soldiers?** 

*Portal: Three Kingdoms*. It has 41 Soldiers. I like to think of this as the "top down" expansion. Designed by Henry Stern this set took *Portal* and dressed it up in a classic Asian legend. As the story revolves around numerous armies, it made a lot of sense that it was filled to the brim with Soldiers. 

**14) Of the Type I tournament legal expansions, which one has the most Soldiers?**

*Onslaught*. It had 19. This question shouldn't have been too tough as *Onslaught* was the first set that cared about "Soldiers" mechanically.

**15) What expansion has Soldiers appearing all of five colors? As a clue, this expansion also happens to be the tournament legal set with the most Soldiers after *Onslaught*.**

Good 'ol *Tempest*. It has 15 Soldiers. I'm not exactly sure why this is true. Let's chalk it up to my subconscious fondness for Soldiers. Here's how they shake out:

* White - [Advance Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advance+Scout), [Elite Javelineer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Javelineer), [Master Decoy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Decoy), [Mounted Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mounted+Archer), [Ranger en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+en-Vec), [Soltari Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Emissary), [Soltari Foot Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Foot+Soldier), [Soltari Guerillas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Guerillas), [Soltari Trooper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Trooper), [Staunch Defenders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staunch+Defenders)
* Blue - [Thalakos Sentry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalakos+Sentry)
* Black - [Dauthi Slayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauthi+Slayer)
* Red - [Opportunist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opportunist), [Renegade Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renegade+Warlord), [Sandstone Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandstone+Warrior), [Soltari Guerillas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Guerillas)
* Green - [Ranger en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+en-Vec)

Yeah, yeah, green's Soldier is a multi-color card. Ain't I a sneak? I just didn't feel [Ranger en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+en-Vec) has gotten enough focus in this column.

**16) Can you name the set that only had two Soldiers, one blue and one green?**

*Mirage*. The blue Soldier was [Dream Fighter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Fighter) and the green one was [Jungle Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Patrol). 

**17) *Sixth Edition* reprinted and functionally changed three cards by turning them into Soldiers. What are the cards? And what type were they all originally?**

[D'Avenant Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=D%27Avenant+Archer) (*Legends*), [Longbow Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longbow+Archer) (*Visions*), and [Femeref Archers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Femeref+Archers) (*Mirage*). They were all originally archers. I put this question in because I wanted to point out that not every Soldier started a Soldier. When *Sixth Edition* came out, R&D condensed a number of creature types (still a topic heatedly debated around R&D) and archer was one of the casualties.

**18) I've talked a lot about Soldiers. How about cards that affect Soldiers? Can you name the four cards in *Onslaught* that have the words "target Soldier" in their text box?**

[Daru Encampment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Encampment), [Grassland Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grassland+Crusader), [Pearlspear Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pearlspear+Courier), and [Piety Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piety+Charm). For the anal out there among my readers (and I know you're out there, I read your mail), I know [Grassland Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grassland+Crusader)'s text box reads "target elf or Soldier" so the words "target" and "Soldier" are not technically next to each other. To quote the rules insert from the game *Outburst* (at least the early versions): "I make-a the game, I make-a the rules".

**19) But wait there's more. What is the one card not in *Onslaught* (or even the whole *Onslaught* block) that has "target Soldier" in its rules text?**

[Icatian Lieutenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icatian+Lieutenant) (from *Fallen Empires*). Are you getting the key parts of Soldier trivia: white, [Ranger en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+en-Vec) and *Fallen Empires*.

**20) Now we get to some trivia about random Soldiers. What Soldier shares its name with a giant?**

[Foriysian Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foriysian+Brigade) (*Weatherlight*). Because it was able to block an additional creature it was named after the [Two-Headed Giant of Foriys](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Two-Headed+Giant+of+Foriys) (from Alpha) - soon to be an avatar at an online **Magic** game near you thanks to Bill Rose winning the [Wizards Invitational](/en/articles/archive/wizards-invitational-winner-2003-03-03). Foriys is a play on "four eyes", by the way. You see, the Two-headed Giant has two heads and thus four eyes. Yes, even Richard Garfield is capable of bad puns.

**21) The look of Gerrard of the Weatherlight crew was based off the illustration of what Soldier?**

[Master of Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Arms) (from *Weatherlight*). You see, when we were commissioning *Weatherlight* art, we gave a bunch of artists the opportunity to try their hand at designing a few of the *Weatherlight* crew. Some experiments like [Master of Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Arms) worked out. Others like [Steel Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Golem) (which was originally Silver Golem as the art was going to be [Karn, Silver Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Karn%252C%2BSilver%2BGolem)), not so much. (A little tribute for the eight other *Firefly* fans out there.)

**22) What Soldier could never die in combat?**

[Dream Fighter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Fighter) (from *Mirage*). Come on, I just mentioned eight questions back. Whenever it got in a fight it phased out itself and the creature it was fighting. Thus, it never died.

**23) What Soldier has two abilities that are identical except the +'s in the first ability are -'s in the second?** 

[Flailing Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flailing+Soldier) (*Mercadian Masques*). "![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif): Flailing Soldier gets +1/+1 until end of turn. Any player may play this ability. ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif): Flailing Soldier gets -1/-1 until end of turn. Any player may play this ability."

**24) What Soldier is a 1/1 when alone but a 2/1 when two of them are in play? (Hint: it's not a Sliver.)**

[Dauthi Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauthi+Warlord) (from *Tempest*). It gets +1/+0 for every creature with shadow in play. 

**25) And let's end with an extra tough question. Besides [Dream Fighter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Fighter), what other Soldier is not destroyed when blocked by a [Thicket Basilisk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thicket+Basilisk)?**

[Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) (from *Legions*). As it's a wall in addition to a Soldier (and a Beeble and a Squirrel and a Chicken, etc.) it is immune to the [Basilisk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk)'s special ability. Why did I include this question? Because since *Legions*, every trivia quiz must have at least one card whose answer is [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus). If you don't plan one, it will sneak its way into another answer.
