Did you know the Gruul Clans have a secret war going on with the Orhov Syndicate? It's so secret that it may not, in the strictest sense, be official. But look at the evidence!


### Fighting in the Pit

In [Pit Fight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Fight), we have a Gruul bruiser (possibly Narbulg Nine Fingers, if the flavor text can be trusted) throwing down against an Orzhov priest. But that could mean anything. People are always fighting in pits.


### Busting Up the Temple

Sure, [Gruul Ragebeast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Ragebeast) could be smashing up any random building. But see the Orzhov priest in the lower right? See the carvings on the pillars? Something brought the ragebeast to this particular Orzhov building. Was it the natural war between red-green and white-black? Who can say?


### Busting Up More Temples

In fact, wrecking buildings is practically [Wrecking Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrecking+Ogre)'s whole job. It might seem that this is just any random building, but if you look in the arches of the two doorways, you'll see the telltale Orzhov symbol. This is another church belonging to the Orzhov Syndicate!
