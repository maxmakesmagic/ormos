Choose your commander for this unique multiplayer *Magic* format. New cards offer new play options, and experience counters will make your commander grow in power during the course of each game. Two-color decks allow for surprising synergies and opportunities to devastate your foes.


 


The set will feature five two-color—enemy pair—100-card Commander decks, along with 55 new *Magic* cards legal in Eternal formats (Vintage and Legacy), but not legal in Standard, Block Constructed, or Modern. Each deck will contain fifteen new cards.


 


Cards from *Magic: The Gathering—Commander (2015)* will be featured and distributed with a new event offering on *Magic Online*—the Legendary Cube! For more on the Legendary Cube, see the [announcement also posted today](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/announcing-legendary-cube-2015-08-05).
