### Collector's Highlights


We gathered four of the best decks from the 2001 World Championships held in Toronto, Canada. Each of these decks was constructed by a Pro Tour player for the Standard Constructed envrionment at the time, which included the *Masques* and *Invasion* blocks and the brand-new *Seventh Edition* set. Each deck features a 60 card main deck, 15 card sideboard, 12 proxy cards along with a decklist, and factsheet. These cards are gold bordered and feature the 2001 World Championship Deck backing.




### Game Features


With the inclusion of *Invasion* Block cards in Standard Constructed, the field at Worlds 2001 was one of the most colorful. Multicolor decks were the choice of the day, although monoblue Orb-Opposition made a strong appearance as well. This was also the first time *Seventh Edition* cards were used at the Worlds tournament. With both *Seventh Edition* and *Apocalypse* sets in the format, every **Magic** "Painland" was available to players.
