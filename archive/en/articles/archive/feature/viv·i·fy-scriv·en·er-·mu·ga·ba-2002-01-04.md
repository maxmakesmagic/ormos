**A·mu·ga·ba![Amugaba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Amugaba)**  

From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
Function: noun  

Etymology: Like many **Magic** card names, Amugaba has its roots in a foreign language - in this case from the Ugandan name *Mugaba*. The naming team thought *Mugaba* meant "one whose animal totem is an eel," and thus would have been very appropriate for the card. However, upon closer inspection of the research source, they realized that they had looked at the wrong entry! *Mugaba* really meant "given by God," and the name that corresponded with eel-totem was actually *Mubiru*. Regardless, they decided that "Amugaba" sounded better than "Amubiru," so the name was kept.
