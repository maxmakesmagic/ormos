Ever since the wording of [Shield of Kaldra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shield+of+Kaldra)[made it (reasonably) clear](/en/articles/archive/whats-helm-kaldra-2004-01-29) that a card called [Helm of Kaldra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Kaldra) would be printed, **Magic** players were looking forward to putting all of Kaldra's three legendary pieces of equipment on one creature.

Then [Helm of Kaldra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Kaldra) was printed in *Fifth Dawn*, and it became clear that producing the creature would not be an issue -- the Helm itself creates a Kaldra Avatar Legend creature token and equips them all up! 

"Kaldra" was called "Jayd" during the design of *Mirrodin*. The playtest card pictured below, the "Ring of Jayd," was not printed in this same form (it was designed even before equip costs!). But it wound up inspiring [Helm of Kaldra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Kaldra):

The art of the Kaldra token that the Helm creates was commissioned for ***Magic** Online*. Here's a high detail view of the Kaldra token art by Donato Giancola, where you can see Kaldra wielding all three pieces of that legendary set of equipment.
