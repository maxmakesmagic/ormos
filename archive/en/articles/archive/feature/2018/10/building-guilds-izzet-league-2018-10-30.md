 Chris is the copy editor for DailyMTG. If the Ts are dotted and the eyes are crossed, he dun goofed. 






For every set we release and every world we visit, the Creative team creates a world guide that covers the history of the groups and characters living on the plane. The concept sketches in the world guide are then used by the talented artists from around the world to realize the creative vision for the set and give life to the cards.


To create *Guilds of Ravnica*, the Creative team revisited the guilds, updating their typical outfits for Ravnica's current weather (autumn) and filling in details on leadership changes and new character developments based on the overarching storyline.


In the gallery below, you can see just a few of the pages this team created to guide the artists as they brought *Guilds of Ravnica* to life. Enjoy!

The Izzet are obsessive experimenters, the epitome of a keen creative intellect combined with an unfortunately short attention span. Their increasingly wild experiments answer only to their insatiable curiosity, which often yields mana geysers, spatial rifts, arcane portals, or other such powerful but unintended results.
