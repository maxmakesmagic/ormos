As the players shuffled for this match that would determine the final roster spot on the Canadian National team—Josh Rider and Nathon Braymore occupy the first two spots—they groused about the luck of their previous rounds opponents.

Guillaume was philosophical about it, "I was lucky all weekend."

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a892.jpg)Rich took a moment to reflect and nodded, "I don't think anyone can beat me in the luck department this weekend—the whole drop and undrop fiasco!"

### Game 1

Rich got his best possible draw in this match up—a turn two [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). "It looks like I am losing," commented Guillaume. All Rich did this game was cycle cards through his [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) and cast card drawers. Guillaume tried to keep up with an [Undead Gladiator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Gladiator) but Rich was ripping through two and three cards every turn.

Whenever Guillaume tried a spell—whether it was [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) or [Skeletal Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying)—Rich was able to [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic) it though his [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). Eventually he cast [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for [Mana Short](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Short) during his opponent's upkeep. When he cast the [Mana Short](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Short)—also during his upkeep—Guillaume was able to dig for three or four cards in response.

"What do I need to show you to make you concede?

"I don't know."

When Guillaume's draw step yielded nothing he did concede and Rich came to a realization, "I guess if you drew [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) you might have won that game. I didn't think of that."

Rich – 1 Guillaume – 0

### Game 2

Guillaume laughed about his loss to Braymore as he sided [Persecute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) in for the second game, "Should I put this in? I know it is pretty useless."

The story had spread throughout the entire hall and Rich figured it out. "Oh I know what that is..."

Guillaume shrugged and showed him the [Persecute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) as he put it in his decks. There are no real surprises here as both players have had access to the decklists since the end of play yesterday. 

When Guillaume passed the turn back to Rich for his second turn he was wincing in anticipation of another turn two [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). "Don't worry, I only have this [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)," Rich teased. [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) revealed a hand of [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood), [Undead Gladiator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Gladiator), [Corrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt) and a handful of lands—the [Corrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt) hit the bin.

One of Guillaume's sideboard cards—a [Disrupting Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupting+Scepter)—had become damaged over the course of the weekend and was replaced with a proxy written on a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). The Quebecer laughed as he tapped out to play it, "I play a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)." He reached for his sideboard box to get the damaged copy but Rich didn't care, "Whatever it is, I'm Force Spiking it."

Guillaume attempted to tutor but it was countered with [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic). Rich started to dig with [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate) while Guillaume tried to keep up with [Undead Gladiator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Gladiator). Rich [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate)d into another [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and saw the zombie and a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp). Guillaume also cycled into [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and saw a handful of lands—5 to be exact—and [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). He took the counter.

Rich cast [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and flashed it back but he seemed to have nothing. Guillaume's [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) was [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)ed but his [Disrupting Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupting+Scepter) landed securely. Tapped out, Guillaume was nervous, "Is this the 'You are dead' turn yet?" 

"Not yet."

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a893.jpg)Slowly but surely, Guillaume began to whittle away Rich's hand while performing stupid Gladiator tricks during his upkeep. When Guillaume played [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), Rich knew it was time to make his move. "Cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) floating a blue and a black." As they picked everything up, Head Judge Marc Hernandez went adjust the game totals in the feature match area. Rich stopped him, "No, no. Not yet." He played and [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and cast [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) naming zombies. This got almost as big a laugh as the six land [Persecute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute).

Two turns later Rich was groaning as he played out a Tog, "Of course I drew it the next turn." He groaned a little more when Guillaume had the [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) EOT. The Scepter came back down but it had a lot of work to do. Rich's [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) revealed a hand of Scepter, [Haunting Echoes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes), [Cabal Coffers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Coffers), [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), and [Skeletal Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying)—he took the [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) and played his [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion).

The Scepter was facing an uphill battle as Rich drew another [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate) and played a [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation). To speed things up, Guillaume attempted the second stick but it was countered. [Persecute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) was also countered on the next turn but Rich's [Persecute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) resolved and emptied the Quebecer's hand of [Haunting Echoes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes), [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) and [Skeletal Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying).

Guillaume kept at him with the stick but [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) kept Rich's hand plump. "I just need my other [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) to not be my last card." When he flashed back [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) he found a Tog and realized that should do the trick as well. 

Guillaume ripped a [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) but it was countered with a [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic). He examined Rich's towering graveyard, "You have enough to kill me three times."

Rich – 2 Guillaume – 0

### Game 3

Guillaume was faced with another hand of six lands and a spell—this time it was a [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). He kept it and drew into a third turn [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) that was countered. Rich had no early plays and Guillaume seemed startled when his [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) resolved for a [Mind Sludge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge). He ripped a [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) to force it through. He took away Rich's only [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) and [Mind Sludge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge) took care of everything else.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a894.jpg)One of the cards Rich lost was [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and he began to recoup his lost cards. When Guillaume attempted another Tutor on the next turn it was countered. A fresh [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) found Rich four more cards and a [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), which revealed a hand of [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) and [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)—he took the [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). 

Pretty soon Rich had more cards than he knew what to do with. After playing a [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate) he cast [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation). On his next turn he looked at Guillaume and said, "Noir..." Guillaume was puzzled so Rich repeated it, "Noir... I am naming black." He showed him the persecute he was referring to and took away the Quebecer's [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood). Guillaume drew a [Skeletal Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) and attempted to draw seven cards but Rich countered it with [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic) after discarding it to make a zombie token.

One turn later a Tog joined Rich's team and Rich officially joined the Canadian Nationals Team. 

Congratulations Richard Hoaen!

**Final Result:** Rich - 3 Guillaume - 0
