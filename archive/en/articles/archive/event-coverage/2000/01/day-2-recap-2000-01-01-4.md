In the wake of US Nationals, many competitors had the current Standard environment figured out. Though over thirty percent of the field decided that Fires was the best deck, by the end of the day, it was the innovators who stood on top.


Despite popular disdain for the decktype, Japanese powerhouse Tomoharu Saito continued his dominance of the tournament with a black-red "Machinehead" variant. He finished the day in first place. Rookie of the Year hopeful Katsuhiro Mori took some ribbing from his friends over his decision to run his trademark Nether-Go deck, but he showed them! Second place after six rounds is a tough argument to overcome.


The last great departure from the popular metagame choices was that of Satoshi Nakamura. His blue-green Opposition deck runs neither Static Orb nor countermagic, but boasts a prodigious creature base of Silt Crawler, Chimeric Idol, Blastoderm and Saproling Burst, as well as Gush and Fact or Fiction for card drawing. He shocked a number of opponents on the way to his Top 8 berth.


The lone Fires deck to make Top 8 was played by Royce Chai, and is of modern design. It runs both Battlemages, as well as a number of black sideboard options.


The remainder of the Top 8 decks were all similar blue-white control designs. Decks of that type represented only fifteen percent of the total field. To put four into Day 3 says something about that deck as a metagame choice.


Surprisingly, Orb-Opposition decks were nearly absent from the tournament area. That didn't keep fearful players from dedicating sideboard slots to defeat it.


Tobey Tamber finished tenth after going 5-1 in the Standard portion, just a hair away from the Top 8. He used Adrian Sullivan's Turbo Chevy deck, with a few minor adjustments.
