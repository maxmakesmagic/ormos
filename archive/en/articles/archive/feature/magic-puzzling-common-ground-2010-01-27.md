Let's do something a little different today. We're going to go back to the bygone days of 1996, when *Duelist #14* published a puzzle that is just as relevant today as it was back then!


...well, that's not entirely true. In fact, one of the answers isn't really right by today's definitions, and another requires intimate knowledge of 1996-era **Magic** paraphernalia. But we're doing it anyway. Enjoy!


Below is a list of eight cards, followed by eight groupings of three cards. Each card fits the theme of one of the groupings. **All you need to do is figure out the theme for each grouping and then find the card from the list that also belongs.** No theme involves the color, expansion, casting cost, or card type (instant, interrupt, etc.) of the cards.


**Which group do these cards belong to?**


[Memory Lapse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse), [Soldier of Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+Fortune), [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog), [Rohgahh of Kher Keep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rohgahh+of+Kher+Keep), [Vesuvan Doppelganger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuvan+Doppelganger), [Mishra's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory), [Infernal Contract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Contract), [Force Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike)
