Oh it's bubble-match time once again! Sitting at 6-2, each player here needs to win to earn their spot into the second day of competition. This was a spicy one, indeed. Sitting in one row together, were (13) Josh Utter-Leyton, (14) Ben Stark, (9) William Jensen, Tom Martell, Martin Juza, (3) Shaun McLaren, (22) Jacob Wilson, Miguel Gatica, and Sam Pardee. They were all facing elimination. And that was just one row. (10) Stanislav Cifka and Reid Duke were elsewhere staving off death.



 The plays were fast and furious. As many decks here were playing some version of Jeskai and some version of Abzan, so the match-ups are known. And it's late here for an American Grand Prix. Whoever wins will have to come back nice and early for another full day of mind-crunching *Magic*, so everyone involved is incentivized to finish up this day and get some rest.



The first match-up finished was Jacob Wilson and William Jensen. Wilson was on Abzan plan, and Jensen had suited up the Jeskai Wins, in contrast to his Pro Tour Blue-Black Control deck. In a very quick 2-0 Wilson won. The Abzan plan is pretty simpleâ€”if you can get the early disruption to stop their few creatures before they start, the burn won't get Jeskai to the finish line.


Wilson had early discard and early removal to take both starting creatures from Jensen out of play, and it was elementary after that.
