Looking for a fast way to get into the world of Elder Dragon Highlander? Look no further than this list! This unusual [Ashling the Pilgrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashling+the+Pilgrim) deck features Ashling (its general) along with 99 [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s. The goal? Play Ashling on the second turn, then go to town pumping her each turn and attacking whichever hapless opponent has it coming. If things get out of control? Simply activate her ability three times in a turn and blow up the world! The Ashling deck is a cinch to build, a blast to play, and super easy to shuffle! The best part is that your opponents will have no idea your hand is filled with just lands provided, of course, that you can keep a straight faceâ€¦
