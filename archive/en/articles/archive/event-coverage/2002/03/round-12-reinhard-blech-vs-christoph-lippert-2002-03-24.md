Reinhard's first picks during the were [Reckless Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge), [Seton's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Desire) and Petravrak whereas Christoph Lippert's first picks were [Mortivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortivore), Patriarch and [Shambling Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Swarm).

That meant that Lippert's deck was way superior.

Still, Blech, who was staying at Lippert's room, decided it was best to concede since it was impossible for him to win any further rounds and he would not like to take his testing partner out of the Top 8.

So he conceded and they played for fun. 

### Game 1

Reinhard played a [Skyshooter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyshooter) on his second turn and charged it after he cleared Christoph's Torturer. Then [Petravark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petravark) took Lippert's only [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), which didn't make any difference since he was flooded with mana and had only drawn lands. With only land in his hand, it was not long before he succumbed to his opponent's attacks.

Blech 1 – 0 Lippert

### Game 2

An [Organ Grinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Organ+Grinder) with a [Strength of Lunacy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+of+Lunacy) on it took away a lot of Blech's life totals.

But Blech quickly made a comeback with a [Springing Tiger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springing+Tiger) and a [Gorilla Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorilla+Titan). As if that wouldn't be enough he played Reckless Assault on them and took the win.

**Final Result:** Blech 0 – 2 Lippert
