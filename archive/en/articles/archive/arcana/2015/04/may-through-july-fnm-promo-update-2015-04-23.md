We're nearing the end of the month, which means it's time for the latest update to the FNM promos list, and this update is certainly a spicy one.



But before we get to that, now seems like a good time to get hyped for Friday Night *Magic* with a little bit of Friday Night Countdown with Richard Hagon and Brian David-Marshall.

May
===



After April comes [Abzan Beastmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Beastmaster), a peculiar Hound Shaman who wants to grant all your card-drawing wishes…so long as he can bring his bigger buddies along. If you like big creatures and you like drawing cards, Abzan Beastmaster will be your friend, too—especially if you do well in a May FNM.

**June**



It's warm outside, but it's getting frosty at Friday Night *Magic* as [Frost Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Walker), a tragically terrifying 4/1 Elemental, comes bounding to a June FNM near you.

**July**



Your eyes do not deceive you. Participate in an FNM in July and you might just walk away with one of the best removal spells ever printed. [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) is a near-universal staple in Modern, and July will grant you an opportunity to stand out further from the pack with this new version, now featuring art from Raf Sarmento. In celebration of *Modern Masters 2015 Edition*, both July and August FNM promos will be Modern staples. What will August’s be? Tune in next month to find out.
