All cultures have their own "civil wars". Minor ones that last a day, and some others last for generations. Which way do you “install” the toilet roll? Should we have the seat up or seat down? Do you prefer Coca Cola or Pepsi? Apple or Android? NSYNC or the Backstreet Boys? The list goes on.


In Japan, there is a snack that can unite or divide. It can make two friends closer than before. It can be the bonding glue between a couple. However, it can also ruin friendships. It can tear families apart (ok, I exaggerate). You could never be invited to birthday parties or Christmas gatherings again.


If you picked the wrong side.

These cookie that comes in two variants. They have very similar packaging and are almost always sold together side by side. Kinoko No Yama (Mushroom Mountain) are the ones that look like little mushrooms with a biscuit stem, while Takenoko No Sato (Bamboo Village) resembles the top of baby bamboo shoots.


They taste almost the same – both are covered in chocolate – yet there are subtle differences. The “mushroom” biscuit has a crispier crunch, which also means it's also a little drier. The “bamboo” cookie is flakier and has a moister texture, albeit not by much.


The “mushroom” version was introduced in 1975, while the “bamboo” came later in 1979. Once that happened, it sparked a war that has lasted more than three decades. *Are you on Team Kinoko No Yama or are you on Team Takenoko No Sato?*

*The “Mushroom and Bamboo” controversy going viral within the Magic community.*


Japanese coverage writer Yuichi Horikawa conceptualized and wrote this story and when it was published on the Official Japanese Coverage website, it garnered over 500 retweets in four hours! We polled 23 of the biggest celebrities in the event hall, making this a “best of 23” match. Hopefully, we can get some resolution on this Ancient Grudge?

If you ever get the opportunity to visit Japan, not only can you attend a fun-filled Japanese Grand Prix, you could even try out both these delicacies and pick a side! As for myself? Well, I like the Takenoko No Sato better but I ain't tipping the scales in this landslide victory! As a matter of fact, I even conducted my own in-house experiment with my own friends. You can try that too!

Definitely Bamboo Village for me!*
