As a holiday treat for all of you, we wanted to share the new Planeswalker appearing in *Born of the Gods*. Players have been asking for a version of Kiora on a card since her introduction in *Duels of the Planeswalkers*.

 Kiora is just a sneak peek at the *Born of the Gods* previews, which begin in earnest on Monday, January 13, and continue for two weeks until Friday, January 24. As always, we will provide a Card Image Gallery that updates daily throughout the preview season.

 The full set will be revealed in the Card Image Gallery on January 24, which gives you plenty of time to look it over before the *Born of the Gods* Prerelease, which runs on Saturday and Sunday, February 1â€“2. Check with your [local store](http://locator.wizards.com/) for schedule and additional information.
