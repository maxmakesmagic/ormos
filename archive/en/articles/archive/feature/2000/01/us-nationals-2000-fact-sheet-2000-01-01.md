**Artists Schedule and Features**


D. Alexander Gregory


Just twenty-four years young, D. Alexander Gregory brings a wealth of worldly experience to his paintings. As the son of a former CIA communications director, Gregory couldn’t help but get his fair share of overseas travel early in life. Born in Nicofia, Cypress, he and his parents lived there until Gregory was five, when they moved to Europe. Gregory and his family landed stateside when the future artist was eight. Gregory’s relationship with Wizards of the Coast started two years ago, when he illustrated ten Jyhad cards. He has also painted paperback book covers, as well as comic book covers for industry heavyweights Marvel Comics and DC Comics. Gregory now resides in New York City with his wife Maho, also an artist.


Rebecca Guay


Rebecca Guay, twenty-six, never wavered in her pursuit of capturing art as a dream job. Always drawn toward classical illustrations and mythological subject matter, Guay grew up in Ipswich, Massachusetts. A 1992 graduate of the prestigious Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, Guay currently resides in Amherst. She considers the work she does for Wizards of the Coast to be her favorite.


Tony DiTerlizzi


The award-winning illustrator, Tony DiTerlizzi, was born in California in 1969. He has studied under several art schools including Florida School of the Arts and The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale. He works for both White Wolf Games Studio and Wizards of the Coast. For Wizards of the Coast, he painted many of the **Magic: The Gathering** cards and also contributed on a 1998 **Magic** calendar. Tony continues to work on various fantasy projects and released a children’s picture book in 1998. He resides in Park Slope, Brooklyn, with wife, Angela, and their pug Goblin.


Mark Zug


Mark Zug spent his early childhood getting schlepped around the world before coming to rest in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where he still lives trying to get his bearings. Along with walking upright, he learned to draw. Success came when he illustrated Harlan Ellison’s I, Robot Screenplay adapted from the Asimov cycle. He then moved into games, lured by Last Unicorn’s Dune collectible card game. Since then, Zug’s work has been published by FASA, Magic, Dragon Magazine, Amazing Stories, and other outlets, mostly under the vast wings of Wizards of the Coast. He currently lives in a tiny town with treacherous rollerblading and a stunning view of the Susquehanna River.
