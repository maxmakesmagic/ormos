Alchemy Rebalances and Event
============================


We're rebalancing some existing Alchemy cards on February 24. Check out the [details on these rebalancing efforts](https://magic.wizards.com/mtga-alchemy-latest-changes) in the latest article.


Alchemy: Try the Latest Changes! Event
--------------------------------------


Accompanying this rebalance, you'll find a new event that will give you an opportunity to play with the changes, experiment with different cards and deck builds, and even earn some individual card rewards (ICRs) and XP!


The Alchemy: Try the Latest Changes! event runs February 24–26, has no entry fee, and is an All-Access event—play with any of the Alchemy cards even if they're not in your collection!


Your first win earns you one *Alchemy: Innistrad* rare ICR. Your second win gets you 1,000 XP. Get a third win, and you'll earn one more *Alchemy: Innistrad* rare ICR!


Arena Open This Weekend
=======================


The Arena Open happens this weekend, February 26–27, with *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Sealed and Draft events!


During Day 1, you'll have a choice between Traditional Sealed (Best-of-Three) and Best-of-One Sealed matches. Rack up seven wins during Day 1, and you'll receive an invitation to the high-stakes Day 2 event.


Day 2 is when competition heats up until it glows—in this case, glows neon—and those who earned an invitation to Day 2 will face opponents in Traditional Draft *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* matches with possible prizes up to $2,500!
