Round 11. Three losses. Three more rounds to go. These players are still in the race for a Top 8 slot, but both were teetering on the edge between success and disappointment. Florian Pils especially was looking to repeat his Top 8 appearance from last year, but would he stumble three rounds before the finish line?



### Game One



Pils led with [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) and saw [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), two [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), [Searing Blaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze) and [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) all waiting to light up his life. One of the [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide)s hit the dirt and Pils definitely had given himself a solid information advantage.


Stahl had little other choice than to just follow his game plan. [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) followed [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), then [Furnace Scamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Scamp). Stahl attacked for four, taking Pils to 14. [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) revealed [Black Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) and Stahl threw his Scamp at Pils' life total, taking him to 11. Pils used his Zenith to clear the board, and Stahl hit him with [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) – down to 8.


Stahl played [Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage), but Pils' [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas) easily outshone the artifact, both in style and in function. For example, Pils had no proper answer to Stahl's Shrine, so he transformed it into a 5/5 creature with [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas), and then played [Consume the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek). [Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) and Stahl's [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) died, and Stahl even forgot to use the [Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer)'s ability off his untapped lands.


From then on, Gerry Stahl did not get any more damage in. [Tezzeret](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret) provided Pils with [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)s, [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) and more [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice)s. Even the [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) that Stahl threw at Pils life total was countered. When Pils activated [Tezzeret](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret)'s Ultimate abillity to deal lethal damage after a couple of attacks with [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) and [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit), Stahl scooped up his cards.

### Game Two



Stahl kicked off in true style this time, doing just what the deck does: Playing [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) on turn one. Even though he had [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), Pils crucially was on the play and had no way to turn the early beats away yet. The [Inquisition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition) revealed [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), [Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) and [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate), so Pils removed the Shrine. But Stahl quickly drew into a second one.


[Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) took Pils to 13 until he found Doomblade to kill it. Two [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) removed the two remaining cards in Stahl's hand, [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) and [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), and all he now had was a [Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) ticking away.


Pils had stabilized, but with just four lands in play was far off from actually winning. Stahl would throw every burn spell at Pils, while charging now two Shrines of Burning Rage. Lighning Bolt brought Pils to 10, giving Stahl 8 counters combined on his two Shrines. Pils played [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb). "Will this do it?" Pils asked himself, as Stahl sacrificed one Shrine for six damage.


Down to 4 life, every burn spell from Stahl would now potentially be lethal, with [Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) promising to seal the deal either way – over time or with a spell.


Then Stahl tapped three mana and went to play a spell, but he caught himself at the last minute – it was a [Manic Vandal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal)! Pils would just have sacrificed his [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) in response to the spell and Stahl would have had to kill his own Shrine. After not playing the Vandal, Stahl simply killed Pils with the [Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage).

### Game Three



Stahl was on the draw, but also on the offensive. [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) – Pils stopped one [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) with [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and had [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), but the early momentum favored Stahl. Pils used the [Inquisition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition) to get rid of the bloodthirst [Berserk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk)er, leaving two [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) and a [Manic Vandal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal) in Stahl's hand.


[Black Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) killed [Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer) and [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), while Pils went to 10 from the [Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer)'s last gift. Stahl wasn't happy with the way the match was going. "This was not the plan, but I need pressure", he said, as he played [Manic Vandal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal) without a target in sight.


Pils had a rather better play himself: [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) and, once again, [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas). Stahl decided not to attack the Planeswalker, taking Pils to 8 with the Vandal. Pils' answer was [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), but Stahl quickly [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember)ed the token. [Ember Hauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Hauler) from Stahl was met by [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) – with just 7 minutes left on the round clock, both players looked to finish this game quickly. To buy himself more time, Pils used [Tezzeret](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret)'s Ultimate ability for a 12-point life swing, bringing himself to 12 and Stahl to 8.


Stahl now had to consider if to kill [Tezzeret](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret) or press on against Pils. But he realized that with an active planeswalker, Pils would both have a source of card advantage and a win condition. He could do nothing about Pils' returning [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), though, and a second [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas) simply added insult to the injury. Stahl had [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) to kill the [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) token again, paying half his life for Phyrexian mana (going to 4). After that, he had nothing left, looked at his next card, shook his head, extended the hand and buried his Top 8 amibitions.
