The numbers are in! 152 decklists have all been counted, sorted, and checked, and now we really know what decks put the most people into the second day of the competition here at Grand Prix Kraków.





| Deck | # Played | % of Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red Aggro\* | 31 | 20.4 |
| Abzan Aggro | 26 | 17.1 |
| Esper Dragons | 26 | 17.1 |
| Abzan Control | 14 | 9.2 |
| Green Devotion\*\* | 10 | 6.6 |
| Abzan Midrange | 5 | 3.3 |
| Blue/Black Dragons | 5 | 3.3 |
| Jeskai Tokens | 4 | 2.6 |
| Ojutai Bant | 4 | 2.6 |
| Red/Green Dragons | 4 | 2.6 |
| Blue/Black Control | 3 | 2.0 |
| Sidisi-Whip | 3 | 2.0 |
| White/Blue Heroic\*\*\* | 3 | 2.0 |
| Jeskai Dragons | 2 | 1.3 |
| Jund | 2 | 1.3 |
| Others\*\*\*\* | 10 | 6.6 |
| Total: | 152 | 100 |


As always, for the purpose of getting a somewhat bigger picture, similar versions of decks have been lumped together in the above table. If you prefer a finer filter, look no further!



\*) The 31 Red Aggro decks include 19 with a splash of green, usually for [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command) and sometimes for one or two copies of [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense)—basically, Martin Dang's Pro Tour-winning list from last week. The other twelve were all mono-colored.



\*\*) Coming from the other side, seven of the Green Devotion decks featured a bit of red, mostly for [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka), akin to what Ondřej Stráský played to a third-place finish at Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*. Two had a splash of white, another was greedy and splashed both white and red.



\*\*\*) The red players weren't the only to dabble in green for a Command as one of the White/Blue Heroic decks included [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command).



\*\*\*\*) The "Others" category was made up exclusively of one-ofs. One was Chromantiflayer, the deck named after the combination of [Chromanticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromanticore) and [Soulflayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulflayer); then there was one copy of Red/Green Bees, featuring the deadly combination of [Hornet Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Nest) and [Roast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roast) and [Setessan Tactics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Tactics); there also was one Black/Red Aggro and one Red/White Aggro, Mardu Dragons and Naya Midrange, an interesting take on Green/Black similar to Rock decks of ages past and Raphaël Lévy's Big Red; finally, two aggressive decks, one in white and green, the other Temur, were both making good use of [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company).
