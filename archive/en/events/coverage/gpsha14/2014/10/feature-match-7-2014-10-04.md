 Han Bing has the honor of representing China this year at the World *Magic* Cup as the captain. After a money finish at Pro Tour Journey to Nyx, he is living up to the expectations of his fellow comrades and finds himself in the comfortable 6-0 position, requiring just one more win to make the Day 2 cut.




 Han is part of the Mardu Horde today, his deck laden with powerful cards such as [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde), [Ghostfire Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostfire+Blade), double [Mardu Roughrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Roughrider) and double [Horde Ambusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horde+Ambusher). It seemed like the type of deck that would do a great job pushing though any opponent's defenses.




 Similarly, Bruce Pai of Taiwan has shown no signs of slowing down. As a veteran of the Taiwanese *Magic* community, he is hoping to continue his winning streak. Pai on the other hand has chosen to ally with the Abzan Houses. He has equally ridiculous bombs of his own, including [High Sentinels of Arashin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Sentinels+of+Arashin), [Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress), [Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast) and [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor).



Game 1
======



 Pai pressured with [Mardu Hateblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hateblade) and [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds) and they managed to do some good work. That was, until Han threatened to counterattack with morphs and a horde of tokens generated by [Ponyback Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback+Brigade).




 Going for the long game, Pai assembled the combo of [Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress) along with [Disowned Ancestor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disowned+Ancestor) and [Mer-Ek Nightblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mer-Ek+Nightblade), while Han managed to put together a 6/6 [Dragon-Style Twins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon-Style+Twins) ([Feat of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feat+of+Resistance) and [Ghostfire Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostfire+Blade)).





*Han Bing has the aid of the Mardu Horde.*
