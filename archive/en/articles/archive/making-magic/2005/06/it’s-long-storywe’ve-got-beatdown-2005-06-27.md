[Last week](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/decking-hall-2005-06-20) I wrote an article that prompted a significant amount of emotional response. So much so that I felt obliged to write a second column about the topic. At the same time, it's Beatdown Week and I want to stay on topic. What's a writer to do? 

How about let the audience pick the column that they want to read? Yes, this week I've written two columns. You get to choose which one you'd like to read. (And if you want to go back and read the other one, I won't tell anyone.)

Column #1 is for those of you that want to watch me dig myself deeper into my hole as I better explain what I was thinking last week. Interested? [Click here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr182a).

Column #2 is for those of you that don't want Mike Long wasting another second of your life, as well as those readers out there that just love beatdown. [Click here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr182b).
