Having spent a fair amount of time playtesting with updated versions of Chris Cannon's winning deck list and getting my face smashed by various incarnations of Weenie Quest decks in the Tournament Practice room on **Magic Online**, I know that I want to get my hands on a play set of extended art [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite)s by rk post. I am going to try and get a quarter of the way there by playing in Game Day this weekend. Everybody gets one just for signing up and if you make it to the Top 8 you also get a pretty dynamic looking extended art [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel).
