**Draft Like A Master**


*Modern Masters 2015 Edition* takes players back to some of the most remarkable planes from recent history, including Zendikar, Mirrodin, Ravnica, Lorwyn, Kamigawa, and Alara. Featuring new artwork on a number of cards, every card in *Modern Masters* can be added to your favorite Modern-format decks. But first, enjoy a fresh Limited experience that combines some of *Magic*'s most iconic cards in new ways.


*Modern Masters 2015 Edition* goes on sale Friday, May 29, on *Magic Online*! *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* is a set that takes essential Modern cards and combines them into an exciting Draft environment. To celebrate both the Constructed and Limited appeal of this set, the *Magic Online* team has made plans that will please Limited and Modern Constructed fans alike.


Limited queues will be running through the Wednesday, June 17, downtime. There's going to be a lot to play around with in this set, so why not try taking *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* for a test run in the Phantom [Draft](#MM2draft) and [Sealed](#MM2sealed) Events? Getting at least 2 wins in either Phantom Event earns players enough Phantom Points to gain entry into another. With enough skill, you can play endless Phantom Limited through the June 17 downtime! Or, perhaps you wish to raise the stakes and get your hands on some sweet, digital booster packs. If so, head on over to the *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* [6-2-2-2](#MM26222) and [8-4](#MM284) Draft Queues. Once you're feeling confidant, participating in the scheduled event can win players big prizes (not to mention a Dark Confidant Avatar).


The [64-Player Single Elimination Draft Event](#64playerdraft) begins Friday, May 29, at 10:30 a.m. The event is scheduled to run every 2 hours, on the half hour, through Tuesday, June 16, 10:30 p.m.â€”make sure you don't miss out! Victory can earn you big booster pack prizes and a healthy stack of [*Magic Online* Championship Series](http://magic.wizards.com/en/2015-magic-online-championship-series) Qualifier Points.

Don't think we forgot you, Constructed fans. You've been building up your *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* collection. You got the Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas and Dark Confidant [Avatars](#avatars). Now's a good time to start tweaking those Constructed decks because *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* is staging a coup and taking over prize tables across several Modern, Legacy, and Vintage Events!


From the Wednesday, June 3, downtime until the Wednesday, June 17, downtime, the Modern 5-3-2-2 Queue will be suspended and replaced with the [Modern 3-2-1-1 Single Elimination Queue](#prizes), which pays out in *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* booster packs. You can find the details for that event [below](#prizes), as well as the details for updated Modern, Legacy, and Vintage 2-Player Queues and Dailies.


Keep your eye on [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online) as we build up steam to *Modern Masters 2015 Edition*'s release. Remember the [Holiday Festival](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online-holiday-festival-2014-11-12)? There's another big celebration on the horizon: the Modern Festival! Stay tuned for details as we get closer to the set's release.
