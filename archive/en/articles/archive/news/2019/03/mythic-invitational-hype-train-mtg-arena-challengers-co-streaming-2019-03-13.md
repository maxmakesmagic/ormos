Beatriz "AliaDeschain" Grancha
------------------------------





**Twitter**: [@AliaDeschain](http://www.twitter.com/AliaDeschain)  
**Hometown**: Valencia, Spain

**Non-*Magic* Fun Facts**: I played every single map at least twice in *Heroes of Might and Magic III* and all the expansions. I know *a lot* about plants and trees.  
**Do you play *Magic* with anyone on a regular basis**? I play *Magic* with Javier Dominguez (my boyfriend) and my coworkers, Guillem Salvador, Juan Guillenea, and Rafus Granero.  
**When did you start playing *Magic*?** In 2003, during original *Mirrodin*.  
**How did you first get into *Magic*?** My ex-boyfriend and friends taught me  
**When did you start playing *MTG Arena*?** I started on the Closed Beta, December 2017  
**What was your first competitive *Magic* tournament?** Grand Prix Bilbao 2005  
**What event or finish has meant the most to you over your career?** Qualifying to this tournament  
**What is the most important thing that *Magic* has brought you?** All the experiences related  
***Magic* is entering a new era—there's a million dollars on the line, the MPL is getting started, events like this Invitational are bringing top players together. What does that mean to you as a *Magic* player?** I love esports, and I love *Magic*, so *MTG Arena* is perfect for me.  
**There are professionals, amateurs, and influencers playing in the Mythic Invitational. What does it mean to play with this diverse range of competitors?** It's so exciting, all the different player personalities in the same place, together!

**What is your favorite card in Standard?** History of Benalia  
**Are you going to PAX East with anyone?** Yes, with Javier Dominguez and Andrea Mengucci







Ondřej "Honey" Stráský
----------------------





**Twitter**: [@OndrejStrasky](https://twitter.com/OndrejStrasky)  
**Hometown**: Prague, Czech Republic  
**Playstyle**: I prefer taking the more aggressive lines over the passive ones, and I feel most comfortable when playing underpowered creature decks.  
**Non-*Magic* Interests**: Mostly just hanging out with my girlfriend.  
**Non-*Magic* Fun Facts**: I broke my arm while playing soccer, twice. I attended a school choir, because I fancied a girl there.  
**Do you play *Magic* with anyone on a regular basis**? My teammates, every three months the Mythic Championship rolls around.  
**When did you start playing *Magic*?** Twelve years ago  
**How did you first get into *Magic*?** Everyone was playing it in my high school, so naturally I had to pick it up. I'm the only one who stuck with the game, though.  
**When did you start playing *MTG Arena*?** At the end of 2018  
**What was your first competitive *Magic* tournament?** Grand Prix Prague 2009—wow, that's ten years ago.  
**What event or finish has meant the most to you over your career?** Helping Oliver Tiu finish third at the 2016 World Championship  
**What is the most important thing that *Magic* has brought you?** My friends; all my roommates are people I met through *Magic*; we would have never met otherwise.  
***Magic* is entering a new era—there's a million dollars on the line, the MPL is getting started, events like this Invitational are bringing top players together. What does that mean to you as a *Magic* player?** I retired from professional *Magic* a couple months ago, but now I'm here grinding everyday like a madman. A lot has changed. I'm really happy with *MTG Arena*. It's a very enjoyable way to prepare for tournaments. I never really cared about the money, but I do love the fact that there are now more high-level tournaments, and I can't wait to play in the Mythic Invitational.  
**There are professionals, amateurs, and influencers playing in the Mythic Invitational. What does it mean to play with this diverse range of competitors?** Over the years, I've gotten used to playing against the professionals, so I know what to expect from them. The amateur players should throw a nice curveball into the field. I, for one, am pretty excited to battle against these celebrities I watch on Twitch from time to time, but never actually get the chance to compete against.  
**Do you have any rivals at this tournament?** Definitely bolov0, aka Thiago Saporito. He crushed me in my first Pro Tour Top 8, and I have been losing badly to him ever since. Definitely on the lookout for some sweet, sweet revenge. It's not going to be easy as he's one of the most talented people to ever pick up a *Magic* card.  
**What is your favorite card in Standard?** Kaya, Orzhov Usurper. I love the design, and that card helped me to qualify for this tournament!  
**Are you going to PAX East with anyone?** One of my roommates is coming with me to provide support and help me with the tournament. We've yet to determine which one, but there is a 66% chance it's going to be a PT Champion.







Edoardo "quicksort" Annunziata
------------------------------





**Twitter**: [@edo\_annunziata](http://www.twitter.com/edo_annunziata)  
**Hometown**: Udine, Italy  
**Playstyle**: Focused and disciplined. Although I can't say my technical play is at level with the greatest out there, I believe I am pretty good at understanding what I'm trying to accomplish in a matchup and playing toward that goal.  
**Non-*Magic* Interests**: I am studying for a master's degree in computer science. I like and regularly play board games in general as well.  
**Non-*Magic* Fun Facts**: 1) In high school I was part of a competitive math team. Team math competitions are a surreal experience if you've never seen one; they are played in sports arenas with the crowd cheering on the stands, and competitors solve hard problems against the clock trying to be faster than the opponents, with a point system deciding the winner. We placed 2nd in the 2014 Italian national tournament. That is, to this day, one of my proudest accomplishments. 2) I wear long-ish hair because of a school theatrical play I was in in middle school. I used to have short hair, and I was asked to grow them longer. I liked that hair style and decided to keep it after the recital.  
**Do you play *Magic* with anyone on a regular basis**? I keep in touch with strong local players. We regularly share decklists, strategies, and insights, and review each other's games post-mortem to spot potential mistakes.  
**When did you start playing *Magic*?** I have been playing on and off, mostly casually, and occasionally on *Magic Online,* since *Kamigawa*. I have started playing more seriously and improving as a player when *MTG Arena* came out.  
**How did you first get into *Magic*?** Playing casually as a child  
**When did you start playing *MTG Arena*?** As soon as the game went into Open Beta  
**What was your first competitive *Magic* tournament?** I haven't played much competitive *Magic* at all, just a couple of PPTQs at a nearby store.  
**What event or finish has meant the most to you over your career?** It has to be this one, without the shadow of a doubt. As I'm writing these words, I'm receiving messages from all over the world congratulating me and asking me, me of all people, for advice and guidance. I wouldn't be honest if I didn't admit that I had luck on my side, at least in the final hours of ladder, and that the difference between myself and the 9th or 10th (or 20th for that matter) ranked player is statistically insignificant, but I like to think that my preparation and dedication to this beautiful game that I re-discovered thanks to *MTG Arena* pushed me over the line. I can't wait to play against the best of the best in this unique event.  
**What is the most important thing that *Magic* has brought you?** Avoiding result-oriented mentality like the plague. It's not uncommon to win games of *Magic* having played badly, or to lose having played well. The only way to get better (at *Magic* or at anything else) is to continuously scrutinize one's own actions and accept and correct mistakes. To assume that if something worked once it will work again in the future regardless of context means thinking like a lab rat.  
***Magic* is entering a new era—there's a million dollars on the line, the MPL is getting started, events like this Invitational are bringing top players together. What does that mean to you as a *Magic* player?** In spite of having never been at any point a game for children (even though children can certainly play it), *Magic* still has a bit of unjustified stigma in the eyes of the general public, to some people it's still "that children's card game." I hope that by becoming bigger and better, we as a community will finally be able to break free of that perception and finally present *Magic* as what it has always been: a great game anyone is welcome to play.  
**There are professionals, amateurs, and influencers playing in the Mythic Invitational. What does it mean to play with this diverse range of competitors?** Everything will be a little more unpredictable, and hopefully more fun. I think mixing those different categories of players in a single event is a great way to acknowledge everyone's different contributions to the game.  
**Do you have any rivals at this tournament?** When chess Grandmaster Akiba Rubenstein was asked who his opponent would be in the following round, he answered "the black pieces." I'll be facing this tournament with the same mentality; it's just another few matches of *Magic*, and I'll just try to play at the best of my possibilities.  
**What is your favorite card in Standard?** Settle the Wreckage. It's a card that changes the way you play by the sole virtue of existing, even if it's not in your opponent's hand. Or deck. I find it very interesting when things like that happen.  
**Are you going to PAX East with anyone?** I'm going by myself.







Lewk "lewk" Faley
-----------------





**Twitter**: [@lucasfaley](http://www.twitter.com/lucasfaley)  
**Hometown**: Iowa City, Iowa, US  
**Playstyle**: When possible I like to be aggressive and dictate the pace of play by presenting my opponents with threats in a manner that is difficult to answer.  
**Non-*Magic* Interests**: I am a student studying pharmacology and public health. I also love to binge-watch TV.  
**Non-*Magic* Fun Facts**: I believe I have what it takes to be a competitive eater, and I went on my first ever flight when I was 29 for Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*.  
**Do you play *Magic* with anyone on a regular basis**? I like to play in drafts at my local shop once or twice a week. My friend Wyatt Darby also has some cubes that we will occasionally play on weekends.  
**When did you start playing *Magic*?** I played *Pokémon* cards as a kid and wanted something with a little more strategy.  
**When did you start playing *MTG Arena*?** I was invited to the Closed Beta.  
**What was your first competitive *Magic* tournament?** I went to an Extended PTQ sometime in *Lorwyn* block. I didn't own all the cards for the deck I wanted to play or know how half of my opponents' decks worked, but I had a lot of fun.  
**What event or finish has meant the most to you over your career?** Qualifying and playing in my first Pro Tour was amazing. I got to play against a number of my *Magic* idols and proved to myself that I belong.  
**What is the most important thing that *Magic* has brought you?** Friends. I've had a number of ups and downs in my life, and the people I've met through *Magic* have helped me get through the hardest times.  
***Magic* is entering a new era—there's a million dollars on the line, the MPL is getting started, events like this Invitational are bringing top players together. What does that mean to you as a *Magic* player?** I view this as a real chance for me to make it on the big stage. I know everyone views me as a nobody, but this is a chance to prove that I belong.  
**There are professionals, amateurs, and influencers playing in the Mythic Invitational. What does it mean to play with this diverse range of competitors?** It's amazing. I am excited to meet some of my favorite players and content creators—and to beat them, of course!  
**Do you have any rivals at this tournament?** Wyatt Darby is both a friend and a rival.  
**What is your favorite card in Standard?** Runaway Steam-Kin  
**Are you going to PAX East with anyone?** I am inviting Robert Taylor along. He is a friend and also puts a ton of work into promoting competitive *Magic* in the Midwest area.

**Twitter**: [@zkiihne](http://www.twitter.com/zkiihne)  
**Hometown**: Amherst, Massachusetts, US

We're excited to kick off our high-level *Magic: The Gathering* *Arena* play featuring 64 of the best players in the world, popular streamers, gamers, and personalities all competing for their share of $1 million and a $250,000 first prize.


Our coverage team for the event will be announced soon, and you'll be able to follow all the action live from PAX East March 28–31. We'll be streaming on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) beginning at 10 a.m. ET on Thursday morning, but if you don't speak English, or you'd like to hear things from a different angle, we've got another option for you as well.


Co-Streaming
============


We're trying something new with the Mythic invitational on Twitch. Streamers will be able to co-stream the official Mythic Invitational feed on their own Twitch channel between March 28–31!


Following Twitch's [Content Sharing Guidelines](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/2903142), you can co-stream the PAX East Mythic Invitational from [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) using OBS or XSplit. This allows anyone on Twitch to be able to cover the event in their voice and with their community. To be clear, co-streamed content is not endorsed by Wizards. And we expect anyone who participates in co-streaming to follow Wizards' [Fan Content Policy](https://company.wizards.com/fancontentpolicy). If all goes well with this test, we hope to do this at future competitive events!


Our hope is that this open policy encourages more regionalized viewing options and gives creators the ability to convey information to their community in their voice. We do plan to work with select regional creators to make sure they are set up for success to co-stream to their local communities, with commentary in their own languages.


While we hope [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) is your go-to place to tune in to the Mythic Invitational, more viewing options on Twitch is always better. We look forward to seeing how creators take advantage of this feature.
