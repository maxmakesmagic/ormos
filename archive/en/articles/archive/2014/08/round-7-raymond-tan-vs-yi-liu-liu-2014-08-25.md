 This feature match highlights the raw power of an all-in strategy against an unprepared field. Red mages have been asking questions of the other colours - mostly 'What was your life total again?' - since the dawn of **Magic**, and the current Standard format is no exception. Scry is a powerful mechanic when it digs you closer to the next burn spell. Black-based decks in Standard are particularly vulnerable to burn, as two of their key strategic cards - [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) - play very comfortably into a burn deck's game plan. [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) and [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa) can provide some relief, but they come at the higher end of the mana curve, which is always a risk...




**Game 1**




 Liu opened with [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) showing Tan with a [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) and [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix). He summoned a [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s, which was promptly [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)ed. A second [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) took a [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood), but Tan had his Phoenix and a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) (in addition to the [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) damage) to keep the pressure up regardless. Liu had an [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) for the Phoenix, then cast an [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) to try and draw into some more answers. Tan didn't give him the time, pushing through more burn damage and recycling his Phoenix to take the first game.






*"Are you a little burned, or is that just a deep Tan?"*
