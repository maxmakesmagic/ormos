*[Editor's note: This article is a hard-core look at recent rules updates. Some of it is very technical minutiae. If you aren't into that kind of stuff, I wouldn't worry about it. This is by no means required reading for the average player.]*


### GENERAL RULINGS


**1)** **Wishes and Sideboards**  

When you play one of the *Judgment™*  [Living Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Living%2BWish) in a DCI™-sanctioned tournament, you choose a card from the removed-from-the-game zone or from your sideboard to put into your hand. If you choose a card from your sideboard, the Wish card is put into your sideboard face up so that all players can see it. The rest of your sideboard remains face down.

It may not be possible to put the Wish card into your sideboard (for example, if you used [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) to copy a Wish). If this situation occurs, your sideboard will contain only fourteen cards for the rest of the game; this is legal. Just make sure your sideboard has fifteen cards in it at the start of the next game you play.


**2)** **[Vengeful Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Dreams) and [Riftstone Portal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftstone+Portal)**  
[Vengeful Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Dreams) has a mana cost of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) and an additional cost of discarding any number of cards from your hand. As long as [Riftstone Portal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftstone+Portal) is in your graveyard, lands you control have ": Add ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) or ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) to your mana pool." Rule 409.1f of the **Magic®** Comprehensive Rules has changed; it now states that you must have enough mana in your mana pool before you pay **any** costs of that spell or ability (see RULES CHANGES). This means that you can't play [Vengeful Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Dreams) if you have only mountains in play. You must have ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) in your mana pool before you discard cards to pay for [Vengeful Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Dreams).  
  
**3)** **[Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) and Morph**  
[Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) and the morph ability both give players alternative ways to play creatures. [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) reads, "Any player may play creature cards with converted mana cost 3 or less without paying their mana cost any time he or she could play an instant." A creature spell with the morph ability may be played face down by paying ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif) rather than its mana cost.

[Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) and the morph mechanic are mutually exclusive; you can't apply both to the same spell. When you want to play a spell, you determine the way in which you want to play it. You can either play the creature spell "as an instant for free" or play it face down for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif), but you can't do both. (Note that since [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) modifies the rule for **when** you can play the creature spell, its effect applies **before** the spell is put onto the stack. [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) doesn't just apply during the paying of costs (rule 409.1f). It modifies the whole process of playing the spell.)


**4)** **[Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and Rule 418.3c**  

(Warning: This section is guru-level stuff.) Rule 418.3c used to cover "variable effects," but that rule has been clarified. Here's the new version of the rule:
"418.c If the spell or ability creating a continuous effect contains a variable, the value of that variable is determined only once, on resolution. See rule 413.2f."


Now, if a continuous effect from a spell or ability doesn't contain a variable, the effect isn't "determined" -- you just apply the effect in timestamp order along with other continuous effects. [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba)'s ability, "Discard a card from your hand: Switch [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba)'s power and toughness until end of turn," doesn't contain a variable. It just looks at [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba)'s power and toughness at the appropriate point in the calculation of its power and toughness and switches them.


Example 1: I have [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and [Castle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle) in play. [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) is 1/5 (1/3, +0/+2 = 1/5). I play [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba)'s ability, making it 5/1 (1/3, +0/+2, switch = 5/1). If [Castle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle) leaves play, [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba)'s power and toughness become 3/1 (1/3, switch = 3/1).


Example 2: I have [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) in play. I play its ability to make it a 3/1 (1/3, switch). Then I play [Castle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle). [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) is 3/3 (1/3, switch, +0/+2 = 3/3).


 5) **[Vesuvan Doppelganger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuvan+Doppelganger) and Nightmares**  

(Warning: This section is guru-level stuff.) If a card like [Vesuvan Doppelganger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuvan+Doppelganger) comes into play as a copy of one of the *Torment™* or *Judgment* [Faceless Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Faceless%2BButcher) and leaves play as a copy of a creature with a different name, the "leaves play" ability doesn't do anything.### ERRATA


**1)** ***Invasion™* "Divvy" Cards**  

The *Invasion* cards [Bend or Break](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bend+or+Break), [Death or Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+or+Glory), [Do or Die](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Do+or+Die), [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), [Fight or Flight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fight+or+Flight), and [Stand or Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stand+or+Fall) used the phrase "separate . . . into two face-up piles." That wording results in a confusing interaction with face-down creatures. The word "face-up" should be removed. The cards in the piles remain face up or face down as appropriate. This change will be included in the Oracle™ update published in conjunction with the *Legions™* set, but the new wordings are effective immediately.

[Bend or Break](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bend+or+Break)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  

Sorcery  

Each player separates all land cards he or she controls into two piles. For each player, an opponent chooses a pile. Destroy all lands in the chosen piles. Tap all lands in the other piles.


[Death or Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+or+Glory)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  

Sorcery  

Separate all creature cards in your graveyard into two piles. Remove the pile of an opponent's choice from the game and return the other to play.


[Do or Die](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Do+or+Die)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)  

Sorcery  

Separate all creatures target player controls into two piles. Destroy all creatures in the pile of that player's choice. They can't be regenerated.


[Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

Instant  

Reveal the top five cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put one pile into your hand and the other into your graveyard.


[Fight or Flight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fight+or+Flight)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  

Enchantment  

At the beginning of each opponent's combat phase, separate all creatures that player controls into two piles. Only creatures in the pile of his or her choice may attack this turn.


[Stand or Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stand+or+Fall)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  

Enchantment  

At the beginning of your combat phase, separate all creatures defending player controls into two piles. Only creatures in the pile of that player's choice may block this turn.


**2) Localized-Language Card Names**  

A French *Onslaught™* card and a Japanese *Onslaught* card were printed with names that match previously used card names. These two names must be changed.


In French, the card [Discombobulate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Discombobulate) should be named "Chamboulement," not "Bouleversement," which was the French name of the *Odyssey™* card [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval).


In Japanese, the card [Mobilization](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mobilization) should be named "Douin-rei," not "Douin," which was the Japanese name of the *Portal™* card [Mobilize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mobilize).


**3)** **Fear**  

The *Onslaught* set introduced the keyword "fear." Many cards in older sets had this ability without the keyword. All of them have been updated to use the keyword. The updated cards are [Avatar of Woe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avatar+of+Woe), [Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breach), [Cateran Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cateran+Enforcer), [Commander Greven il-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commander+Greven+il-Vec), [Corrupting Licid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupting+Licid), [Cursed Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Flesh), [Duskwalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskwalker), [Ebony Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ebony+Charm), [Face of Fear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Face+of+Fear), [Fear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fear), [Fen Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fen+Stalker), [Frightcrawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightcrawler), [Guiltfeeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guiltfeeder), [Hooded Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hooded+Kavu), [Intimidation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intimidation), [Marsh Lurker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Lurker), [Order of Yawgmoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Order+of+Yawgmoth), [Rathi Intimidator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Intimidator), [Razortooth Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razortooth+Rats), [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator), [Shriek of Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriek+of+Dread), [Sleeper's Guile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleeper%27s+Guile), [Sleeper's Robe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleeper%27s+Robe), [Squirming Mass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirming+Mass), and [Suq'Ata Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suq%27Ata+Assassin).  
  
**4)** **Flagbearers**  

The three *Apocalypse™* cards that refer to Flagbearers have been functionally changed. Their previous wordings did not work when combined with the *Onslaught* card [Artificial Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificial+Evolution).

[Coalition Flag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Flag)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  

Enchant Creature  

Coalition Flag can enchant only a creature you control.  

Enchanted creature's type is Flagbearer.  

Whenever a spell or ability an opponent controls is put onto the stack, if that spell or ability could target a Flagbearer in play but doesn't, that opponent changes one of its targets to a Flagbearer.


[Coalition Honor Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Honor+Guard)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  

Creature –- Flagbearer  

2/4  

Whenever a spell or ability an opponent controls is put onto the stack, if that spell or ability could target a Flagbearer in play but doesn't, that opponent changes one of its targets to a Flagbearer.


[Standard Bearer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standard+Bearer)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  

Creature –- Flagbearer  

1/1  

Whenever a spell or ability an opponent controls is put onto the stack, if that spell or ability could target a Flagbearer in play but doesn't, that opponent changes one of its targets to a Flagbearer.


The interactions between the Flagbearers and certain cards has changed:


* [Radiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiate) -- The Flagbearer ability is ignored until after all the copies of the spell created by [Radiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiate) are put onto the stack. Then the spell and all its copies are forced to target Flagbearers.
* [Deflection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflection) -- It's now possible to change the target of a spell away from a Flagbearer.
**5)** **[Camouflage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Camouflage)**  

The previous wording of [Camouflage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Camouflage) turned creatures in play face down. [Camouflage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Camouflage)'s new wording produces the same results as its old wording, without the need for turning creatures face down.

[Camouflage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Camouflage)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)  

Instant  

Play Camouflage only during the declare attackers step.  

This turn, instead of declaring blockers, the defending player chooses any number of creatures he or she controls and divides them into a number of piles equal to the number of attacking creatures. Assign each pile to a different attacking creature at random, and any creatures in that pile that can block the creature do so. *(Piles can be empty)*


**6)** **[Illusionary Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Mask)**  

Due to the introduction of the morph mechanic, [Illusionary Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Mask)'s wording has changed. [Illusionary Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Mask)'s ability functions a lot like creatures with morph, but it uses named counters to mark the creature (unless that creature has a printed mana cost of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif), of course). The face-down creatures put into play by [Illusionary Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Mask) are 0/1, not 2/2. The Mask doesn't require you to pay the creature's colored mana cost. For example, you could pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220908064341im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless8.gif) to put a card with mana cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413132456im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless5.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) into play.

The [Illusionary Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Mask)/[Phyrexian Dreadnought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought) combo still works. You can pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) to use [Illusionary Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Mask)'s ability to put the Dreadnought into play face down, then turn it face up by removing the mask counter from it. This allows you to circumvent the Dreadnought's drawback of sacrificing creatures with total power 12 power or greater.


[Illusionary Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Mask)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)  

Artifact  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif): Put a creature card with converted mana cost X or less from your hand into play face down as a 0/1 creature. Put X mask counters on that creature. Play this ability only any time you could play a sorcery. You may turn the creature face up any time you could play an instant by removing all mask counters from it.


**7)** **[Johan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Johan)**  

The previous wording for [Johan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Johan) did not work due to the order of actions in the declare attackers step. The new wording is a minor functional change, but it allows [Johan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Johan) to work correctly when attackers are declared.

Creature -- Legend  

5/4  

At the beginning of your combat phase, you may have Johan gain "Johan can't attack" until end of combat. If you do, attacking doesn't cause creatures you control to tap this combat if Johan is untapped.


**8)** **[Raging River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+River)**  
[Raging River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+River)'s ability split creatures into piles for a long period of time. During that time, it was possible for other cards to also attempt to split the creatures into piles. Raging River  

has been reworded to remove the need for piles.

Enchantment  

At the beginning of your combat phase, each opponent chooses "east" or "west" for each creature without flying he or she controls.  

As you declare attacking creatures, choose "east" or "west" for each attacking creature.  

"East" creatures can't block "west" creatures. "West" creatures can't block "east" creatures.


**9)** **[Spore Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spore+Cloud) and [Tangle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle)**  

Both [Spore Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spore+Cloud) and [Tangle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle) were vague about identifying which creatures wouldn't untap during which untap step. The wordings of both cards have been modified to make the functionality clearer. This isn't a functional change.

Instant  

Tap all blocking creatures. Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn. Each attacking creature and each blocking creature doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.

**10)** **[Teferi's Realm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Realm)**  

Changing permanent types caused problems with the previous wording of [Teferi's Realm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Realm). The new wording checks the permanent type rather than the card type of noncreature permanents.

Enchant World  

At the beginning of each player's upkeep, that player chooses artifacts, creatures, lands, or global enchantments. All nontoken permanents of that type phase out.


**11) Other Cards**  

The Oracle wordings of the following cards have minor changes, none of which significantly impact game play: [Abolish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abolish), [Basalt Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basalt+Golem), [Chain Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Lightning), [Chain Stasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Stasis), [Cho-Arrim Alchemist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cho-Arrim+Alchemist), [Dingus Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dingus+Egg), [Flameshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameshot), [Foil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foil), [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake), [Goblin Artisans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Artisans), [Honorable Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honorable+Passage), [Imprison](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imprison), [Infinite Hourglass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infinite+Hourglass), [Interdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Interdict), [Iron Maiden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Maiden), [Jungle Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Patrol), [Lord of the Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Pit), [Marjhan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marjhan), [Meddle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddle), [Melee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melee), [Minion of Leshrac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minion+of+Leshrac), [Misers' Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misers%27+Cage), [Mudslide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mudslide), [Outbreak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outbreak), [Paupers' Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paupers%27+Cage), [Shelkin Brownie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelkin+Brownie), [Shyft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shyft), [Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snag), [Tempest Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempest+Efreet), [Timberline Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberline+Ridge), [Timmerian Fiends](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timmerian+Fiends), [Tolaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria), [Venarian Gold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venarian+Gold), [Wall of Kelp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Kelp), and [Wheel of Torture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+of+Torture).


### RULES CHANGES


The October 2002 version of the **Magic** Comprehensive Rules includes a number of rules changes and clarifications.


**1)** **Creature types** -- The rules for choosing creature types were changed to prevent anything strange happening when using the *Onslaught* card [Artificial Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificial+Evolution).

"214.7a If a card instruction requires choosing a creature subtype, you must choose one, and only one, existing creature type."


The full list of **Magic** creature types, including the *Unglued™* set and various starter-level sets is as follows: Abomination, Aboroth, Advisor, Aladdin, Albatross, Alchemist, Ali-Baba, Ali-from-Cairo, Alligator, Ambush-Party, Ancestor, Angel, Ant, Antelope, Ape, Archaeologist, Asp, Assassin, Assembly-Worker, Atog, Aurochs, Avatar, Avenger, Avizoa, Badger, Ball-Lightning, Bandit, Banshee, Barbarian, Barishi, Basilisk, Bat, Bear, Beast, Bee, Beeble, Behemoth, Being, Berserker, Bird, Boar, Bodyguard, Brother, Brownie, Brushwagg, Bull, Bureaucrat, Butterfly, Camarid, Camel, Caravan, Caribou, Carnivore, Carriage, Carrier, Cat, Cavalry, Cave-People, Centaur, Cephalid, Cheetah, Chicken, Chimera, Citizen, Clamfolk, Cleric, Clone, Cobra, Cockatrice, Constable, Cow, Crab, Crocodile, Crusader, Dandan, Demon, Dervish, Deserter, Devil, Devouring-Deep, Dinosaur, Djinn, Dog, Doppelganger, Dragon, Dragonfly, Drake, Drill-Sergeant, Druid, Dryad, Dwarf, Eagle, Eater, Eel, Effigy, Efreet, Egg, Elder, Elemental, Elephant, Elf, El-Hajjaj, Enchantress, Entity, Erne, Essence, Exorcist, Faerie, Fallen, Farmer, Ferret, Fiend, Fish, Flagbearer, Flying-Men, Force, Fox, Frog, Frostbeast, Fungus, Fungusaur, Gaea's-Avenger, Gaea's-Liege, Gargoyle, Gatekeeper, General, Ghost, Ghoul, Giant, Gnome, Goat, Goblin, Golem, Gorgon, Graveborn, Gremlin, Griffin, Guardian, Gus, Gypsy, Hag, Harlequin, Hell's-Caretaker, Heretic, Hero, Hipparion, Hippo, Homarid, Hornet, Horror, Horse, Horseman, Hound, Hunter, Hydra, Hyena, Illusion, Imp, Incarnation, Infernal-Denizen, Inquisitor, Insect, Island-Fish, Jackal, Jellyfish, Kavu, Keeper, Kelp, King, Kithkin, Knight, Kobold, Kraken, Lady-of-Proper-Etiquette, Leech, Legend, Legionnaire, Lemure, Leper, Leviathan, Lhurgoyf, Lichenthrope, Licid, Lion, Lizard, Lord, Lurker, Lycanthrope, Mage, Maggot, Maiden, Mammoth, Manticore, Mantis, Marid, Martyr, Master, Medusa, Meerkat, Mercenary, Merchant, Merfolk, Mindsucker, Minion, Minor, Minotaur, Miracle-Worker, Mist, Mistfolk, Mob, Mold-Demon, Monger, Mongoose, Monkey, Monster, Mosquito, Mummy, Murk-Dwellers, Mutant, Mystic, Nameless-Race, Narwhal, Necrosavant, Nekrataal, Niall-Silvain, Nightmare, Nightstalker, Noble, Nomad, Octopus, Ogre, Ooze, Orb, Orc, Orgg, Ouphe, Ox, Oyster, Paladin, Peacekeeper, Pegasus, People-of-the-Woods, Phantasm, Phelddagrif, Phoenix, Pig, Pikemen, Pirate, Pixie-Queen, Plant, Poison-Snake, Poltergeist, Pony, Preacher, Priest, Prism, Pyknite, Rabbit, Raider, Ranger, Rat, Rebel, Reflection, Rhino, Robber, Roc, Rock-Sled, Rooster, Rukh, Sage, Salamander, Sand, Saproling, Satyr, Scavenger, Scorpion, Scout, Serf, Serpent, Shade, Shapeshifter, Shark, Sheep, Ship, Shyft, Sindbad, Singing-Tree, Sister, Skeleton, Sliver, Slug, Smith, Snake, Soldier, Sorceress, Spawn, Speaker, Specter, Spellshaper, Sphinx, Spider, Spike, Spirit, Sponge, Sprite, Spuzzem, Spy, Squire, Squirrel, Stangg-Twin, Starfish, Stone, Strider, Survivor, Swarm, Tactician, Tarpan, Taskmaster, Tetravite, The-Biggest-Baddest-Nastiest-Scariest-Creature-You'll-Ever-See, Thopter, Thrull, Thundermare, Tiger, Titan, Toad, Tombspawn, Tortoise, Townsfolk, Tracker, Treefolk, Troll, Turtle, Uncle-Istvan, Undead, Unicorn, Vampire, Viashino, Villain, Viper, Volver, Vulture, Walking-Dead, Wall, War-Rider, Warrior, Warthog, Wasp, Wave, Whale, Whippoorwill, Wight, Wiitigo, Wildebeest, Will-o'-the-Wisp, Witch, Wizard, Wolf, Wolverine, Wolverine-Pack, Wolves-of-the-Hunt, Wombat, Wood, Worm, Wraith, Wretched, Wurm, Yeti, and Zombie.


**2) Editing creature types** -- Rule 415.4 has been modified so that the *Onslaught* card [Artificial Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificial+Evolution) will work.


"415.4. An effect that changes the text of a spell or permanent only changes words that are of the correct type (for example, a **Magic** color word being used as a color word, a land type word used as a land type, or a creature type word used as a creature type). The effect can't change a proper noun, such as a card name, even if that proper noun contains a word or a series of letters that is the same as a **Magic** color word, basic land type, or creature type.


"Spells and abilities that create creature tokens use creature types to define both the creature types and the names of the tokens. These words can be changed, because they are being used as creature types, even though they're also being used as names. Once a token has been created, it has its creature type and name printed on it. The creature type of a creature token in play can be changed, but its name can't."


**3) Abilities on cards outside the in-play zone** -- A number of rules have been modified to support abilities on cards (like the *Judgment* Incarnations) in zones other than the in-play zone.


403.1: Defines where an activated ability can exist.


403.2: States that only a card's owner can play the activated ability of a card outside the in-play zone.


418.4: This section now defines continuous effects from **static abilities** rather than from permanents. Both 418.4a and 418.4b have been modified.


418.5c: Defines the "timestamp order" for static effects from cards that aren't in play


"Continuous Effect" glossary entry: Covers continuous effects from static abilities on cards outside the in-play zone.


**4) Copies of spells** -- A number of rules have been modified or added to cover copies of spells.


"401.1. A card on the stack is a spell. As the first step of being played, the card becomes a spell and goes on the stack from the zone it was played from (usually the player's hand). (See rule 217.6, 'Stack.') A copy of a spell is also a spell, even if it has no card associated with it. A spell stops being a spell when it resolves (see rule 413.2), is countered (see rule 414, 'Countering Spells and Abilities'), or leaves the stack somehow."


"414.1. To counter a spell is to move the spell card from the stack to its owner's graveyard. Countering a copy of a spell removes the copy from the stack. Countering an ability removes its pseudospell from the stack. Spells and abilities that are countered don't resolve and none of their effects occur."


"420.5j A copy of a spell in a zone other than the stack ceases to exist." **[NEW RULE]**


"503.10. To copy a spell means to put a copy of the spell onto the stack; a copy of a spell isn't 'played.' When copying a spell, all information that is normally copied from a permanent is copied. In addition, all decisions made when the spell was played are copied. These include mode, targets, the value of X, and optional additional costs such as buyback. (See rule 409, 'Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.') Choices that are normally made on resolution are not copied. A copy of a spell is itself a spell, but it has no spell card associated with it. It works just like a normal spell: It can be countered or it can resolve, and it uses the same timing rules as normal spells."


"503.10a A copy of a spell in a zone other than the stack ceases to exist. (This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.)" **[NEW RULE]**


**5) Legality of playing spells and abilities** -- Several rules have been modified to clarify the legality of playing a spell or ability.


409.1: Clarifies when the legality of playing a spell or ability is checked. The changed text reads, "If, at any point during the playing of a spell or ability, a player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the spell was played illegally; the game returns to the moment before that spell or ability was played." Also, two sentences in this rule were moved to other rules in this section.


409.4: This is a new rule which contains text moved from rule 409.1: "A player can't begin to play a spell or activated ability that's prohibited from being played by an effect."


413.2c: Clarifies that a player can't choose to take an optional action that isn't possible.


422.1: Clarifies which actions can and can't be reversed. This rule now reads, "If a player realizes that he or she can't legally take an action after starting to do so, the entire action is reversed and any payments already made are canceled. No abilities trigger and no effects apply as a result of an undone action. If the action was playing a spell, the spell card returns to the zone it came from. The player may also reverse any legal mana abilities played while making the illegal play, unless mana from them or from any triggered mana abilities they triggered was spent on another mana ability that wasn't reversed. Players may not reverse actions that moved cards to a library or from a library to any zone other than the stack. Players may not reverse actions that involved a random choice or random zone change."


**6) Timing of paying costs** -- Rule 409.1f has been changed to prevent random actions from making a player unable to play a spell or ability. (See "[Vengeful Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Dreams) and [Riftstone Portal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftstone+Portal)" under GENERAL RULINGS for more information.)


The following text has been added to rule 409.1f: "Once the total cost is determined, it becomes 'locked in,' and the player then has a chance to play mana abilities (see rule 411, 'Playing Mana Abilities'). Once the player has enough mana in his or her mana pool, he or she pays all costs in any order."


Also, a sentence from rule 409.1 has been moved to 409.1f: "Playing a spell or ability that alters costs won't do anything to spells and abilities that are already on the stack."


**7) Instants and sorceries that try to come into play** -- Rule 217.1a now says, in part, "If an instant or sorcery card would come into play, it remains in its previous zone instead."


**8)** **New rule for [Future Sight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Future+Sight) and similar cards** -- Rule 217.2e is a new rule that explains when the new top card of a library is revealed.

"217.2e Some effects tell a player to play with the top card of his or her library revealed. If the top card of the player's library changes during the announcement of a spell or ability, the new top card won't be revealed until the announcement is complete."


**9) Effects that contain variables vs. variable effects** -- The distinction between spells and abilities that contain variables and those that produce a variable effect has been clarified. The word "variable" has been removed from rule 409.1e. (Also, a sentence has been deleted from that rule because it was no longer necessary.) Rule 418.3c now covers only spells and abilities that contain variables, so it applies to [Wellwisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) and [Wirewood Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Pride), but not to [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) or [Blood Lust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Lust).


"409.1e If the spell or ability requires the player to divide an effect (such as damage or counters) among a number of targets, the player announces the division. Each of these targets must receive at least one of whatever is being divided (for example, damage or counters)."


"418.3c If the spell or ability creating a continuous effect contains a variable, the value of that variable is determined only once, on resolution. See rule 413.2f."


**10)** **Rule 413.2a and [Contested Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+Cliffs)** -- Rule 413.2a has been changed to make the functionality of the *Onslaught* card [Contested Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+Cliffs) clear. The following text has been added: "If a target is illegal, the spell or ability can't perform any actions on it or make the target perform any actions."**11) Order in which players make choices** -- The second paragraph of rule 413.2d has changed: "Some spells and abilities have multiple steps or actions, denoted by separate sentences or clauses. In these cases, the active player makes any choices required for the first action, then the nonactive player makes any choices required for that action, then the first action is processed simultaneously. Then, the active player makes any choices required for the second action, then the nonactive player makes any choices required for that action, then that action is processed simultaneously, and so on."


**12) Fear** -- The new rule 502.25 defines fear, a new keyword ability.


**13) Morph and Face-Down Spells and Permanents** -- Rules for the new morph ability have been added to the Comprehensive Rules in section 502.26. Section 504, now called "Face-Down Spells and Permanents," has been radically changed to support the morph mechanic.


**14) Minor clarifications** -- Several rules received minor wordings clarifications.


314.1c: Clarifies when the active player could receive priority during the cleanup step.


400.1: Defines characteristic-setting text for cards, permanents, and spells, not just cards.


408.1c: Clarifies what "passing in succession" means. If both players pass without taking any action in between passing, then they have passed in succession. If either player takes an action (including adding mana to his or her mana pool or turning a face-down creature face up), the players have not passed in succession.


408.2e: Now states explicitly that "If a player had priority before a mana ability was played, that player still has priority after it resolves."


413.2h: The words "from the stack" were added: "A spell card is put into play from the stack under the control of the spell's controller (for permanents) or is put into its owner's graveyard from the stack (for instants and sorceries) as the final step of the spell's resolution."


503.3: The example now uses the current Oracle text for [Vesuvan Doppelganger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuvan+Doppelganger).


"As though" glossary entry: A paragraph has been added which reads, "If two cards state that a player or card may do the same thing 'as though' different conditions were true, both conditions could apply. If one 'as though' effect satisfies the requirements for another 'as though' effect, then both effects will apply." An example has also been added.


"Colorless" glossary entry: Now mentions face-down spells and permanents.


"Mana" glossary entry: Added two paragraphs: "The type of mana a permanent 'could produce' is the type of mana that any ability of that permanent can generate, taking into account any applicable replacement effects. The amount of mana is irrelevant (even if it's 0); only the type matters. If the type of mana can't be defined, there's no type of mana that that permanent could produce." "The 'type' of mana includes both its color (if any) and any restrictions placed upon it (for example, mana that can be used only to play artifact spells)."


"Outside the Game" glossary entry: This term was added to the glossary with the following definition: "A card is 'outside the game' if it's in the removed-from-the-game zone, or if it isn't in any of the game's zones. 'Outside the game' is not a zone."
