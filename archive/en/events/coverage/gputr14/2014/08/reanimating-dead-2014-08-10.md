 There were times when even the opponents of Dennis Spenner were rooting for him since he was running such a crazy deck this weekend. He decided to put his money on a Graveyard deck that would bring back "nutty" cards like [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) or [Angel of Serenity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Serenity). I wanted to talk a little strategy with him.
