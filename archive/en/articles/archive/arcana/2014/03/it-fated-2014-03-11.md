 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 







It's Fated Week here at DailyMTG.com, so let's look at [the Fated cycle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&sort=cn+&name=+%5Bfated%5D) from *Born of the Gods*! Trick took [a close-up look at one](/en/articles/archive/fated-retribution-2014-01-30-0) already, but since Mark Rosewater wrote this week about [the history behind the cycle's design](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/290), today we're going to show off all five art pieces.
