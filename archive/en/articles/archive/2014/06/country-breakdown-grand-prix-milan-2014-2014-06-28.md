The numbers are in. 1147 players have made the travel to Milan, Italy to enjoy the last limited Theros Block Grand Prix. Players from Europe, Asia, North & South America, even Africa have opted to spend their weekend with live Magic rather than watch the FIFA World Cup or try their luck of opening Moxes and Black Lotuses on Magic Online. 42 different nationalities will battle for the glory here. That's if you count England as a country of its own rather than belonging to Great Britain. But hey, they do it at the World Cup, and since England did quite bad there, let's keep an extra fingered crossed that some of their brave four competitors here make it to Day Two.
