It's safe to say that Saturday was a roller coaster for the Kaechs. We [featured the family team in our coverage yesterday](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppor14/family) after the father/son/son team defeated the pro trio of Ari Lax, Craig Wescoe and No. 18 Ranked Player Alexander Hayne to move to 4-0 on the day and wow the large crowd of spectators at Grand Prix Portland.

Things didn't go as smoothly from there.



The dream quickly faded as Randy and his sons — 16-year-old Stone and 13-year-old Richy — lost the next two rounds. That left them at 4-2 and in need of some lucky breaks to continue their unlikely run.


"It was like, 'I guess we're back to the have fun plan,'" Stone said. "Besides, we had already won, right? We beat the pros. I thought our tournament was over, and I would've been okay with that."


Except that's not quite how things worked out. The Kaechs — playing in their second Grand Prix and here simply to enjoy playing *Magic* together regardless of record — kept winning. They took the final match of the day in extra turns to advance to Day 2 and keep the fun going.


"It was really cool to win like that," said Richy, who like is father is playing in his first-ever Day 2 today. "We're excited to be here today and we're hoping to place as high as we can."


Stone isn't the only one surprised to see his team sneak into Day 2.


"We've gotten a few funny looks, especially Richy," Stone said. "Everyone wants to know how old he is. We just want to do good for each other. Playing today has been pure fun even though we're 1-2 right now."


Stone, who is now 2-for-2 in making Day 2 after accomplishing the same feat at Grand Prix Vancouver, is most looking forward to returning home with some newfound respect from his peers. Richy is looking forward to playing more *Magic* and making the next Grand Prix trip.


Their father isn't looking forward to anything. He's just enjoying the ride.


"This is as exciting as it gets, and it's lived up to everything we hoped for and more," he said. "Our goal was to make Day 2, and we did that.


"I'm here to play with my boys. And we're just having fun."
