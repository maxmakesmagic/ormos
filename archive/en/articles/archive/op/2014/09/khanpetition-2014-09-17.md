 Morphs, wedges, and more have been on the tips of many tongues in the *Magic* community, as the *Khans of Tarkir* Prereleases are fast approaching. In fact, they're this weekend!




 The *Khans of Tarkir* Prerelease is your first opportunity to play with cards from *Magic*'s latest block. Show up to your local Prerelease, pick a clan, build your deck, and get to it!

When you pick a clan and get your clan pack, it will contain one of eight different Prerelease promos for that clan. We won't be revealing the 40 Prerelease promo rares, so what you're going to get will be a mystery. The fastest way to find out what the Prerelease promos are will be to attend a Prerelease and see what you and everyone else gets.


If you're looking to read up on this weekend's festivities, or if this is your first Prerelease, here are some helpful articles to check out:

 After the *Khans of Tarkir* Prerelease, and official release the week after, we'll soon be heading into October.




 The first two Grand Prix of October take place in Shanghai and Orlando, with both events showcasing the brand-new *Khans of Tarkir* Limited format on the premier play stage. Follow the coverage from home and you'll be able to get your first big glimpse into what the *Magic* pros are doing in both *Khans of Tarkir* Sealed Deck and Booster Draft.




 Players who also compete in the main event for both events will receive some awesome, event-exclusive playmats. First up is Shanghai's, which just went up on our [Fact Sheet](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-shanghai-2014) for the GP earlier this week.





*Get this playmat by registering for the Grand Prix Shanghai main event (while supplies last).*
