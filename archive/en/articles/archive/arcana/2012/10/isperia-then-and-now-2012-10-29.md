The leader of the Azorius guild is the sphinx Isperia, currently appearing in *Return to Ravnica* as [Isperia, Supreme Judge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isperia%2C+Supreme+Judge). But Isperia first appeared in *Ravnica: City of Guilds* as [Isperia the Inscrutable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isperia+the+Inscrutable).

The art for [Isperia the Inscrutable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isperia+the+Inscrutable) was drawn with more background than you see on the card. In fact, it looks like this!

Back then, the guildmaster was [Grand Arbiter Augustin IV](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Arbiter+Augustin+IV). But by the time Isperia came back in *Return to Ravnica*, the sphinx had taken the position and got a new card: [Isperia, Supreme Judge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isperia%2C+Supreme+Judge).

Fischer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Scott%20M.%20Fischer%22%5D)

Isperia's new look also appears on [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation):

There's another place to get a good look at Isperia, but it's not on a card. As seen in [this Arcana](/en/articles/archive/new-mtgo-avatars-2012-10-15), there's a new **Magic Online** avatar for [Isperia, Supreme Judge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isperia%2C+Supreme+Judge)!
