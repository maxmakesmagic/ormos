*Khans of Tarkir* promises to give us a slew of new wedge cards for consideration. And, given that it's Wedge Week, it seems like a good time to review the wedge cards that have come before.


Brace yourselves. The pickings are slim.


For those who don't know, wedges (like the shards) are three-color groupings centered around one color. In a shard, the "center" color is then flanked by two allies. So the Esper shard centered around blue and included blue's two allies, white and black. Conversely, the wedge around blue includes red and green—in this case, Temur. Note that being centered on a color doesn't mean anything more than explaining how the colors are arranged.


With that out of the way, let's revisit every wedge card ever printed.


Yup, every one. There are that few.


For the purposes of this trip through the Multiverse, we're only counting cards that are exactly in the three colors in the wedge—so no five-color cards, and certainly no Nephilim. Most of them come from the Commander set, but a few made it into normal expansions.
