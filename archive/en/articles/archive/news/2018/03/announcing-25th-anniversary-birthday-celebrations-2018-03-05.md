It's our birthday, and this year we're throwing *you* a party.


Later this year—our 25th, if you haven't heard—we will be throwing six massive, can't-miss birthday events all around the globe to celebrate with as many fans as possible in the most memorable ways possible.


That means our parties will feature *Magic* celebrities, premier artists, panels, and special play events that are going to dig deep into our super Wizards of the Coast vaults, culminating in *Limited Edition (Beta)* and *Unlimited* Rochester drafts.


Yes, you read that right. *Beta*. *Unlimited*. Rochester. Drafts.


There are more details to come, but we might as well lead with the headline. Grand Prix Vegas and Gen Con will feature *Beta* Rochester drafts, the other events will feature *Unlimited* Rochester drafts.


(Rochester drafts are, in and of themselves, kind of old-school. In this format, packs are opened one at a time and placed face-up on the table, then drafted one person at a time. In this way, everyone sees everyone's picks.)


Qualifying for one of these Rochester drafts won't be easy. To do so, players will need to win a Sealed qualifying tournament (sets used to be announced later; purchase of entry required), and spaces will be limited. There will be eight Sealed qualifying tournaments per Grand Prix/Gen Con. The winner of each tournament will receive an invite to the Draft event.


We're not stopping there, either. We're opening the vaults for other historic Draft opportunities, giveaways, prizes, and more that feature sets from *Magic*'s entire, expansive 25-year history.


Oh, and of course, there will be cake.


The birthday celebration will be held all around the world so as many people as possible have the opportunity to celebrate! With cake.


* Grand Prix Las Vegas: June 14–17
* Grand Prix Singapore: June 22–24
* Grand Prix Barcelona: June 29–July 1
* Grand Prix São Paulo: July 6–8
* Grand Prix Chiba: July 20–22
* Gen Con (Indianapolis, Indiana): August 2–5

More details will become available for each event as we get closer, including full guest lists, panel lists, and artists in attendance. Planning a birthday party takes time, especially when you're inviting millions of your closest friends. Watch for more details on DailyMTG, [CFBEvents.com](http://cfbevents.com/), and on [pastimes.net](http://www.pastimes.net/).


Until then, Happy Birthday to us! We hope you enjoy the celebration.
