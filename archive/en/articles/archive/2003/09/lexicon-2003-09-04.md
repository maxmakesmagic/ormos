[The Lexicon](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/columnarchive&column=thelexicon) was a weekly feature that ran here on MagicTheGathering.com about a year ago. It was retired for a few months, but we're dusting it off. While it won't run weekly, you'll see it now and again.


The goal of The Lexicon is to teach players the meanings of some of the more obscure words we use in card names. While many of the offbeat names (like "[Hundroog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundroog)") are simply made up, we often dig around dictionaries for real little-used and archaic words for inspiration.


Here are some examples from the *Scourge* set:
