By Wizards of the Coast











We're celebrating the launch of *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* with one of our coolest superdrops ever! It's packed full of Japanese-inspired drops, radical neon, and even a crossover with Street Fighter. Check it out!




---

Additionally, starting with this superdrop, Brazilian customers will be able to preorder from *Secret Lair* and have drops shipped directly to their doorstep. Fulfillment will be DDP (delivery duties paid), meaning the cost of duties, taxes, and shipping will be collected upfront at checkout. Brazilian customers will also be required to provide their CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas) number at time of purchase. This program is still in its early stages and subject to change. We will be looking to add local payment methods and other improvements as this program develops.

[Customers can purchase these drops from the Rakuten website](https://books.rakuten.co.jp/event/game/mtg/?scid=we_mtg_special_game_non_en-us_20220218), and Rakuten will then ship the order.

 \*Inclusive of local VAT

Seven drops are promised to the purchaser of this bundle. Seven drops they shall receive: each non-foil in temperance, yet beautiful and mystifying in appearance. The seven non-foil drops of this bundle have a history that spans days, maybe even weeks. It's said, in some cultures, that the first drop is symbolic of good fortune. The second brings good health, while the third is great for posture. The fourth drop represents getting a strike in bowling, and the fifth represents converting a spare off a split, which is honestly more impressive. The meanings of the sixth and seventh drops are shrouded in mystery, but some say they are portents of beginning a new television show and successfully making a single, perfect pancake.


*FULL-OF-FOILS BUNDLE*
======================

Foil fanciers, rejoice! This bundle contains all eight foil drops from the February 2022 Superdrop! All of 'em! That's two fours, or four twos if you're gonna be like that. You know what else totally rules and is tangentially related to the number eight? Octopuses. That's right. Those eight-armed brain monsters from the ocean *and* the occasional nightmare. And yeah, you heard us right. Octopuses is a more correct plural than octopi—look it up. And don't you dare bring any of that octopodes nonsense into our lair, we're not about that life.


*THE BUNDLE BUNDLE*
===================


![THE BUNDLE BUNDLE](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/tr98wztmnpap.png)

*The Bundle Bundle* contains one of every single available drop, both in foil and non-foil (where applicable). That's fifteen *Secret Lair* drops, all in a single bundle. Some of the more tender-hearted among you might be thinking, "That's inhumane! How can they bundle fifteen drops in a single box? They won't be able to breathe!" While we understand where you're coming from, and while we stand in admiration of your kindness, we must remind you that *Secret Lair* drops are inanimate objects and have no need for such trivialities as air or sustenance. If you do receive a *Secret Lair* drop that appears to be breathing or demands to be fed, we recommend that you set it down and run away as fast as you possibly can. But that only happened once, so you probably don't have to worry about it!
