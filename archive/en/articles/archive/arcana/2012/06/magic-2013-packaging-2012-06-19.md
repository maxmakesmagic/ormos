Well, that could be more informative. Let's break the contents out so we can get a better look.

Very nice! The ***Magic** 2013* Fat Pack contains: 

* Nine ***Magic** 2013* 15-card booster packs
* Player 's guide with complete visual encyclopedia
* The ***Magic** 2013* card box
* 80-card basic land pack
* Special edition Spindown life counter
* Two deck boxes

And while we're on this subject, how about looking at the ***Magic** 2013* Intro Packs? They're designed for introducing new players to the themes and mechanics of the set, and for the first time, they now contain *two* booster packs to go with the ready-to-play 60-card deck. And each one has a foil rare, which is clearly visible through the window on the front of the box. The new MSRP for ***Magic** 2013* Intro Packs is $14.99.


### Path to Victory


Attack early and often with your ever-growing battalion. Under the command of Odric, Master Tactician, your troops will overwhelm your opponents, even dictating their blocking decisions if you attack with three or more creatures. Blue fliers provide air support as you march to victory.

### Depths of Power


Seize the power of wind and waves with the help of legendary merfolk Talrand, Sky Summoner. While drakes assault your enemies from the skies, you manipulate the battlefield and burn immediate threats, steering the course to victory.

### Sole Domination


Choose a single fearsome attacker to lead the charge in this deck filled with exalted creatures led by the legendary demon Nefarox, Overlord of Grixis. Your other forces lend support and defense, ready for their turn to lead the attack.

### Mob Rule


Hordes of goblins are spoiling for a fight in this aggressive deck. Get ready to raze the city, as legendary goblin Krenko, Mob Boss recruits another goblin for every goblin you already have. As your mob grows, your opponent will have no place to hide.

Massive creatures hit the ground running with this explosive deck. Legendary elf Yeva, Natureâ€™s Herald adds an element of surprise to your game, letting you cast creatures just about whenever you want to. Crush your enemies when they least expect it.
