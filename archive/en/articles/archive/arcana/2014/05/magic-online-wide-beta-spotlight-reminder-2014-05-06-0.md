 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 







Starting tomorrow, Wednesday, May 7, **Magic Online** will be running its second Wide Beta Spotlight. The Spotlight will run from the end of downtime on Wednesday until 10 a.m. Pacific on Friday, May 9. During that time, the ability to log in using the current client will be deactivated; you will only be able to play using the Wide Beta client. 


**The Wide Beta is Real**
 Please be aware that everything you do on the Wide Beta is "real." 


 This means any purchases you make, trades you complete, or events you participate in count, and will carry over to any version of **Magic Online** you use on our production system. 


 While the Wide Beta Spotlight is running, the **Magic Online** team asks that you do all the things you normally do on **Magic Online**, including trading, playing games, joining events, and building decks. 

To encourage players to log in Wednesday through Friday, we're also offering incentives to Spotlight participants:

1. **Early access to the **Magic Online**
*Journey into Nyx* Prerelease Events:**  Wide Beta players will be able to access *Journey into Nyx* Prerelease Events a full day early, from Thursday, May 8, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific until the Prerelease Events open to players on both clients at 10:00 a.m. on Friday.
2. **Wide Beta Spotlight Promo:** Wide Beta Spotlight participants who **play** in a *Journey into Nyx* Prerelease Draft or Sealed event during the Spotlight will receive a promo version of [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms). Players who **win** a *Journey into Nyx* Prerelease Draft or Sealed event during the Spotlight will also receive a premium promo version of [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms).
