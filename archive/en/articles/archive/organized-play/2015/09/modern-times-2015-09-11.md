This week, we've got a quick recap of yesterday's announcement, a little bit of Modern that has passed by with some 2015 World *Magic* Cup Qualifier Top 8 decklists, and some Modern to look forward to and more with a look at the next few days of Grand Prix and what to watch on Twitch.


2016 Grand Prix Updates
=======================


Yesterday, Hélène Bergeot announced a couple of changes to the 2016 Grand Prix schedule. In addition to that, she also revealed the venues and organizers for each of next year's Grand Prix, along with the updated prize structure for all of 2016's events.


While the [Premier Events calendar](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premier-calendar#/overview) and [Grand Prix events page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/grand-prix-event-types-events) have been updated with these changes, if you are planning on attending any Grand Prix next year, I highly advise bookmarking [yesterday's announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/2016-grand-prix-updates-2015-09-10), as it will be an invaluable asset for you if you are planning your trip more than a few weeks in advance. If you're planning on attending multiple Grand Prix, it also provides a great general overview on the year.


2015 World *Magic* Cup Qualifier – Round 2
==========================================


Last weekend, players from seventy-three countries competed in their nations' World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers to earn a spot on their country's team in the 2015 World *Magic* Cup, taking place December 11–13 in Barcelona, Spain. That marks seventy-three teams that now have their third confirmed representative.


The full list of World *Magic* Cup teams as of last weekend can be viewed at this page. From September 19 to 20, the third and final World *Magic* Cup Qualifier of the year will take place, and the teams will be confirmed in just a few short weeks.


In the meantime, we have a number of Modern decks for you to look through from some of last weekend's World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers. You can take a look at the Top 8 decklists that we currently have below:
