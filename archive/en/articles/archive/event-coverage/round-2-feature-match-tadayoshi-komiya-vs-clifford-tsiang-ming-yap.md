Yap got things underway with a second turn Thunderscape Familiar. Komiya used a Jilt without kicker to send it back to his hand in hopes of slowing him down. Yap, who was holding no black spells, was not disappointed by this. He summoned a Caldera Kavu, followed by Nightscape Apprentice and re-summoning the Familiar.


Komiya, who gave up card economy very early by using up the Jilt, was now ready to regain it. He summoned a Phyrexian Rager, then gated it with Marsh Crocodile, and used Gerrard's Verdict to force Yap to discard Ana Disciple and Bloodfire Kavu. Next he summoned Coastal Drake, using it to bounce Caldera Kavu. He was soon on the offensive with his Crocodile. Stormscape Familiar and the re-cast Rager presented further problems for Yap, who summoned a Cinder Shade and used it in combination with Apprentice's first strike ability to get rid of the Rager. However, he was down to seven life points.


Yap had Cinder Shade and six lands untapped on the following turn, so Komiya only
attacked with his two flyers. Yap cast Agonizing Demise with kicker to destroy Coastal Drake, taking one damage from the Apprentice. Komiya retaliated by forcing Yap to discard his last card - Caldera Kavu - via Hypnotic Cloud. On his turn, Komiya sealed the game by summoning Hunting Drake and forcing Cinder Shade onto the top of Yap's library. Yap caught Komiya's Samite Pilgrim tapped, and was able to kill Hunting Drake by dealing three damage to it via Darigaaz' Charm, but was a Pyrrhic victory as he was now down to two life and Komiya had two 1/1 creatures in play.

It was no surprise that the gamble did not pay off - he may have drawn a second land for his Samite Pilgrim, but he didn't find a third.


In the meantime, Yap had a very fast start. He played a turn two Urborg Elf, followed by turn three Trench Wurm and turn four Penumbra Bobcat. He used Agonizing Demise to take out the Pilgrim (at this point his opponent played another land and was able to summon a Coastal Drake), then cast Skizzik with kicker and sent in the team. Still mana-hosed, Komiya could not put up a fight for very much longer. Having failed to draw a fourth land on his next draw step, Komiya conceded, allowing the match to advance to the third game.


Yap started out with an excellent hand, but Komiya was able to hurt him plenty with a second turn Gerrard's Verdict - yanking a Death Bomb and a Swamp out of Yap's hand and gaining three life in the process. Yap summoned a Quirion Explorer, promising another lightning-fast draw - but Komiya was not mana hosed this time. He summoned a Rager, then used an Exotic Curse aggressively, taking out Yap's Elf. Yap had a Penumbra Bobcat, staring down the Rager but not for long. Hunting Drake send the Bobcat onto the top of Yap's library.

He caught up a bit more by summoning Pouncing Kavu with kicker. Unfortunately, he was pretty much out of gas at this point, his best play being to recast the Bobcat - whereas Komiya was holding a Repulse. Yap was forced to keep his Pouncing Kavu back to block Komiya's forces. That was fine with the Japanese players - he would attack for three points of damage in the air each turn. With Yap down to six life, he used Repulse aggressively, sending Pouncing Kavu back to its owner's hand, and attacked with all of his creatures. Yap was able to block with Bobcat and survive the turn, but he was too far gone to make a comeback in this game. Hobble landed on the black token generated by the dying Bobcat, allowing the Japanese player to attack for the kill.


**Final Result:** Komiya 2 - Yap 1
