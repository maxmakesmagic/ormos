*Left to right: Rodrigo Togores, Cristian Ortiz Ros, Adrian Ramiro Cano*


**Name:** Adrian Ramiro Cano


**Age:** 29


**Occupation:** Programer


**Hometown:** Mallorca, Spain


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** 


Top 8 at Grand Prix Madrid 2016, one point at Pro Tour Kyoto.


**What deck did you play and why? Did the Team Unified Modern rules play a role?**


I'm playing [Vizier of Remedies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+Remedies) [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), the best deck in the format, and moreover it's not sharing any cards with the decks of my two mates.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


Is awesome.

**Name:** Cristian Ortiz Ros


**Age:** 24


**Occupation:** *Magic Online* grinder


**Hometown:** Murcia, Spain


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** 


Finalist Grand Prix Copenhagen 2017.


**What deck did you play and why? Did the Team Unified Modern rules play a role?**


Blue-Red [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) Storm, because I could not play [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End).


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


Happiness.

**Name:** Rodrigo Togores


**Age:** 28


**Occupation:** Video editor


**Hometown:** Madrid, Spain


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** 


Won Grand Prix Prague in the best GP Legacy finals ever.


**What deck did you play and why? Did the Team Unified Modern rules play a role?**


Two of us are experts with our own decks, and our third is a [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) expert. So, naturally, he had to make a sacrifice for us and learn how to play Storm.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


Having another top finish at a Grand Prix is awesome.

**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** 


Second place at a World *Magic* Cup Qualifier; some RPTQs.


**What deck did you play and why? Did the Team Unified Modern rules play a role?**


White-Blue Control, because it fits my playstyle very well and I'm familiar with trhe deck which is important in Modern. Also, it is just a really good deck. Props to Benny Hill for putting it in the spotlight.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


I've always wanted to play on the Pro Tour, so it really means a lot to me. Being able to go with my teammates makes it even better. It also means I will buy my girlfriend the ring that I promised her if I'd ever Top 8.

I played Grixis [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) as it's probably the best [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) deck at the moment. Because of Team Unified, I played Opt instead of [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) instead of [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember). I was very happy with Opt during the tournament.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


Making a Grand Prix Top 8 and qualifying for the Pro Tour were two dreams of mine.

As a student, the prize money comes in very handy. But most of all, being able to go to the Pro Tour with my friends is super awesome!

Elves, because they are cute. Also you can kill on turn three. The sideboard is the hardest part because all three of us play green.

My two friends asked me to play with them to qualify again for the Pro Tour. So I'm really happy with this Top 4 and the chance to win another trophy.

Red-Green [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) because it is unexpected and fast. Also, with this choice, I could play my entire deck and my teammates could too.

I can play at the Pro Tour again! My teammates were the best! This journey was the best!

**Occupation:** It consultant

Won an FNM.


**What deck did you play and why? Did the Team Unified Modern rules play a role?**


I played Jeskai Control, because I played the deck ever since I started with Moderb, so for four or five years now. My teammates were flexible in their deck choices. Christian only demanded that I play the deck I know.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


It's my first money finish, my first Pro Tour invite, and I'm just happy that I could do it with my favorite deck! I still hope [Thrun, the Last Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll) gets banned.

Bronze locked. And second Pro Tour invite.

I'm locked for Gold now. Bringing my friends to Pro Tour *Dominaria* to play by my side also means a lot to me.
