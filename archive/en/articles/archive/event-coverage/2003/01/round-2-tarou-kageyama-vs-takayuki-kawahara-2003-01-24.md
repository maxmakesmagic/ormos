![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gphir03/a997.jpg)This round saw Japan's favorite hard-luck player, Tarou "John" Kageyama, square off against newcomer Takayuki Kawahara. Kawahara is running what looks like Kai Budde's "Randomized Malka" deck from Grand Prix – Reims. Kageyama is playing something a little stranger. Designed by none other than Itaru Ishida, his deck is green-black-white Oath of [Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life)gain. In addition to saner Oath targets like [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) and [Visara the Dreadful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful), Kageyama's deck boasts [Ancestor's Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestor%27s+Chosen) for a big life boost. It can even Rector out [Test of Endurance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Test+of+Endurance). Ishida rejected the deck as "too crazy", but that only made Kageyama like it more.

### Game 1

Kageyama led with [Llanowar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Wastes), but had to wait on [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) for a sign as to what deck his opponent was playing. Kawahara obliged by showing [Llanowar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Wastes) and [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). Kageyama aimed for [Spiritmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger). He saw instead a pair of [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed)s, along with other goodies. Kawahara played another [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and fired back a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) of his own. His look of puzzlement drew laughs from the crowd. Kageyama's hand was [Academy Rector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Rector), [Overgrown Estate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Estate), [Visara the Dreadful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful) and [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed). Naturally Kawahara took the Deed.

Kageyama played his third land and waited. Kawahara had free reign. Instead of busting out a Deed, he chose to get his [Genesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) online, after using [Bloodstained Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire) to fetch a mountain. This gave Kageyama a huge opening. He untapped, dropped his fourth land and [Academy Rector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Rector), then sacrificed it to flash back [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). Not only did he strip Kawahara's Deeds, he got [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) on the table.

Kawahara was forced to Deed away the Oath before things got crazy, and then Kageyama had [Dust Bowl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Bowl) to pin down his lands and a 6/5 swinging freely. Kawahara couldn't keep up. Itaru Ishida watched from the sidelines, shaking his head very slowly.

Kageyama 1 – Kawahara 0

### Game 2

Kawahara led with swamp, and played [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) in response to Kageyama's [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). Kageyama looked for [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), but saw only lands, another Tutor, and [Wall of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Blossoms). It turned out Kawahara had gone for a Therapy of his own. He tried for Oaths, but missed. Kageyama came down with [Volrath's Stronghold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath%27s+Stronghold), and Kawahara took the time to flashback his [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) through his Wall, stealing the [Academy Rector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Rector).

Kageyama smiled as he plucked [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids). This forced Kawahara to Tutor during his upkeep for [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) and drop it into play. Kageyama kept the pressure up with [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth). He was given a gift when Kawahara forgot to activate the Oath. He had [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), though, and for a few turns they traded hits, each unwilling to make another move. Finally, nearing death, Kawahara couldn't hold out any longer, and Deeded away Kageyama's board. 

![Volrath's Stronghold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Volrath%27s+Stronghold)Kageyama's recovery was hastened by his [Volrath's Stronghold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath%27s+Stronghold). A [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) of his own complicated things. Kawahara hid behind [Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder) for a turn. Kageyama went for the throat. He checked for [Spiritmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger)s with [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), then flashed it back to leave Kawahara with just [Recurring Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) and lands in hand, his [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) having traded with Kageyama's. Two turns later Kageyama swung in for the kill.**Final Result:** Tarou Kageyama defeats Takayuki Kawahara 2-0
