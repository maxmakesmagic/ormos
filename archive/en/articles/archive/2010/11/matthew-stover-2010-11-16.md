| **1. Hero or Villain** | No man is a villain in his heart, and no man is a hero to his valet. So it's a push. |
| **2. Night or Day** | A hard day's night, a hard knight's Dei. They're both hard, and not in a good way. |
| **3. Dog or Cat** | Dog. Snow dog. Specifically, Alaskan Malamute. I like having pets who are smarter than I am. |
| **4. Happy or Smart** | The fact that this is a valid question is a sad truth about life on Earth. |
| **5. Cake or Pie** | I think you mean, "Cake or death? And we're out of cake." |
