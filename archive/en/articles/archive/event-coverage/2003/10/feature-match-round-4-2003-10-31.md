![Round 4 Feature Match: Shvartsman vs. Thoren](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/956.jpg)Both of these players are pretty big wheels down at the cracker factory. Alex Shvartsman, game store owner and Pro Tour Niceguy, has been putting up the big finishes on the Tour and the Grand Prix Circuit since practically forever. His opponent, the always-stoic Jens Thoren, was recently immortalized on the card [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) (or The Thorenator), his prize for winning last year's **Magic** Invitational. Thoren is with the Scandanavian red-blue Welder deck, and Shvartsman is naturally with YMG Oath.

### Game 1

Thoren looked at a hand of [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire), [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) and two [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder)s. He shipped it back. His next was far worse, and he didn't give it a second thought. He stopped at five, with two land, [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) and [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key).

![Jens Thoren, sans Borg implants](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/957.jpg)Shvartsman opened with the Reef and [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed after Thoren played [Great Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace) and [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere). No lands came. He played a [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), imprinting [Fire/Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire%2FIce) and waited on [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) mana. Thoren popped his Sphere and played a Key. Another [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), and still Shvartsman had no lands. Thoren got his third mana and resolved a [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) on Shvartsman's end step. He pitched [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver).

He untapped, and tried a [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith). Shvartsman wasted no time [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ing it. Thoren showed him Seat of the Synod and a second [Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monolith), powering out [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire). Shvartsman was far from helpless, though. He finally found a land, and with a second [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) imprinted with [Cognivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cognivore) he dropped [Oath of Druids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids). Thoren seized the opening, playing another Key and [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ing it away for a [Citanul Flute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citanul+Flute), ready to serve up a steady stream of [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder)s.

He fetched a pair, and then a [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus), with Shvartsman remaining impassive behind four mana and a four cards in hand. He had two [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s, a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and a [Krosan Reclamation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation). Thoren played the [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus), which went uncontested, then lost both his Welders to Shvartsman's countermagic. Shvartsman untapped, Oathed up a [Cognivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cognivore) (a mere 7/7), and then imprinted [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) on [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter). The usually unflappable Thoren was forced to adjust his glasses and ruffle his hair.

[Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) met little resistance from Shvartsman, who sat back on his Scepter. Thoren fetched another pair of Welders and made a Pentavite. The Scepter took one down, but the other resolved. [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus) showed just how he earned his keep the following turn, when he showed that he could serve up [Cognivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cognivore) chumps all day long. Shvartsman stopped the Welder from getting crazy with a [Krosan Reclamation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation), but his life total was dwindling. Thoren also had [Lightning Greaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves) to complicate things. Shvartsman held back. Thoren tutored up [Bosh, Iron Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosh%2C+Iron+Golem).

He baited with [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), forcing Shvartsman to tap his Scepter, then came down with the [Iron Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Golem). Shvartsman's untapped [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) meant Thoren couldn't just run in for the win. He gave it back. Shvartsman Oathed away his library, then got back two [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish)es with [Krosan Reclamation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation). He fetched [Rack and Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rack+and+Ruin) out of his sideboard.

"Target [Bosh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosh) and..."

Thoren cut him off. "You can't target [Bosh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosh), he has [Lightning Greaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves) on."

 "[Lightning Greaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves) makes him untargetable? That sucks." - Alex Shvartsman It did. Shvartsman had no way to stop Thoren from chucking for the win.

Thoren 1 - Shvartsman 0

### Game 2

![Alex Shvartsman is in a muddle](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/958.jpg)Both players kept their opening hands and were off. Shvartsman blazed out with [Shivan Reef](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) imprinting [Cognivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cognivore), and [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) on [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). Thoren's Reef, Welder wasn't nearly as explosive. He tried a turn-two [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire), but Shvartsman had [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) ready. The following turn he tried [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker). Shvartsman, with only one card in hand, turned on his Scepter and kept [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) and [Oath of Druids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids).

Thoren showed him another [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) and [Lightning Greaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves). He moved to put it on his [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), but Shvartsman had a response, Naturalizing the Greaves. This was fine with Thoren, who had no artifacts in hand. He merely exchanged the Greaves for the [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire). Shvartsman was locked down, and used his [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) Scepter while he could. Thoren took the opportunity to Thirst away [Bosh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosh).

Shvartsman could do little. Thoren brought [Bosh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosh) back at end of turn, and then [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed up a [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus). Another pair of Greaves let them get in for eleven. Shvartsman Oathed up a [Cognivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cognivore) and tried to look imposing. Thoren was not bluffed.

"[Bosh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosh) you?" - Jens Thoren

Shvartsman was thusly [Bosh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosh)ed.

Jens Thoren defeats Alex Shvartsman 2-0
