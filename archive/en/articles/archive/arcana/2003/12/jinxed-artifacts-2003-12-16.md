Unless you're the size of a [Sneaky Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sneaky%2BHomunculus) or are wearing powerful [Glasses of Urza](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Glasses%2Bof%2BUrza), it can be hard to make out small details of **Magic** card art. 

Have you seen the [little surfer](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/115) on [Flame Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Wave), for example?

Let's take a zoomed-in view of a few of **Magic**'s "jinxed" items.

  
  
  
  
You may already know that certain drawback-laden, "jinxed" artifacts flavorfully curse their controllers, and initiate a game of Hot Potato as soon as they hit the board. For example, **[Jinxed Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jinxed+Idol)** from *Tempest* is a creepy stone figurine that stings its bearer for 2 damage a turn. Give it away as soon as you can -- if only to stop seeing its ugly mug on your side of the table.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
And you may have seen that *Stronghold's* 
**[Jinxed Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jinxed+Ring)** is a piece of jewelry in the shape of [Volrath the Fallen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Volrath%2Bthe%2BFallen) toothy head that bites the "wearer" for each card he or she loses. How... unwholesome.

  
But did you know that *Mirrodin's* 
**[Jinxed Choker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jinxed+Choker)** is actually a thin silver snake that slowly tightens its grip, increasing its turn-by-turn damage as the charge counters pile up?

Perhaps the [Flame Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Wave)[surfer](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/115) was a slightly less unsettling detail to zoom in on!
