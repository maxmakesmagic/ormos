*What's your favorite enchantment in **Magic**, and why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_miketurian.jpg)**Mike Turian:** When I first started playing **Magic** I didn't play in sleeves. They weren't popular at the time. I also only had one deck to play. The deck was green-white and featured [Preacher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preacher)s, [Cockatrice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cockatrice)s, [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), and [Sylvan Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library).

If you have ever shuffled and played with a **Magic** deck for a year without sleeves, the resulting cards aren't pretty. I am the proud owner of a [Sylvan Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library) that is about as beat up as a **Magic** card can be while remaining intact.

The thing I love about [Sylvan Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library) is that for two mana you get a card that does everything. You can draw extra cards with [Sylvan Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library). You can leave cards on top of your library to protect cards from discard. You can predict the top card of your library with a [Vexing Arcanix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Arcanix). Or you can simply leave the chaff of your deck on top of your library and shuffle your deck with a fetchland.

I love that almost nobody knows the rules about how [Sylvan Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library) works. When you are playing with it you constantly end up in awkward situations like having two Sylvan Libraries out, or a [Sylvan Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library) and a [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine), etc. To compound that I was always playing with an Italian *Legends* [Sylvan Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library), so no one could read the card to help answer these questions!

[Sylvan Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library) has been the inspiration for many **Magic** cards I have worked on over the years. My favorite of those is [Cream of the Crop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cream+of+the+Crop). I always loved looking at the top of my deck with Sylvan and I always loved playing giant monsters. [Cream of the Crop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cream+of+the+Crop) plays right into both of those strategies.

Just writing this answer makes me want to go build a new deck with [Sylvan Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library).
