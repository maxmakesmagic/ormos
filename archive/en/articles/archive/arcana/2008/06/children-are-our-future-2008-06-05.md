The other week, Wizards of the Coast participated in Take Your Children to Work Day. The children seemed to enjoy spending the day at a game company, which isn't much of a surprise, really.

One of their activities was to design a **Magic** card, and we think the cards they came up with are pretty interesting. Mark Rosewater took each group (8-10 years old and 11-17) and showed them twenty potential pieces of art. Once the art was picked by the group, they named the card. From there, they selected a creature type, a power and toughness, a mechanic, and flavor text. Finally, they came up with the card's mana cost, which is where Mark provided the most guidance.

The 8-10s picked [Sickle Ripper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickle+Ripper)'s art right away and came up with the Reaper of the Dark Flame:

Their theory was that he could turn his arms into knives and then throw the knives at people, resulting in this mechanic:

Each child that came to Wizards of the Coast got to take home a sheet of paper with shockingly realistic card images on it:
