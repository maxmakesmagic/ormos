We’re back! We had such a positive response to the first “[You Make the Card](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/columnarchive&column=youmakethecard),” we’ve decided to do it all over again. For those unfamiliar with this feature, let me quickly explain. We are going to let all of you, the MagicTheGathering.com readers, design a **Magic** card. Each step we will give you decisions and let you vote. The outcome of the vote will determine what step we take.

In addition, the first “You Make The Card” was so popular that we will be translating the second one into additional languages (including [Japanese](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/125,,ja)). This will allow even more player’s access to this unique opportunity. Please be aware that the need to translate each step will slightly lengthen the time between steps.

The first “You Make The Card” resulted in the card [Forgotten Ancient](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=global/images/mtgcom_feature_109_pic1_en.jpg) that will appear in *Scourge* (the second expansion to *Onslaught,* coming out this spring.) You all did an excellent job and I hope you have fun playing with your card when it comes out.

### Step 1 - Color

But enough of the last card, let’s figure out what we’re going to do this time. As with the first “You Make The Card,” we are starting by letting you pick the card’s color. We have removed green as an option, as it was chosen last time, but have added in "artifact" as an option (and yes, I understand it’s not technically a color).

We’re not going to start voting until Monday, February 3. We are doing this to give you all a chance to think and "talk amongst yourselves" before voting, because the color of the card is probably the biggest decision you'll have to make, as it, more than anything else, will determine the overall direction this activity will go in. Note that we have an entire folder dedicated to “You Make the Card” in the Wizards of the Coast message boards. The voting will start February 3 and will end on Sunday, February 9th. In order to vote, you will need to register. We require this because we need to ensure that there is no manipulation of the ballot.

The choice is now in your hands. So what do you all want to do this time?

The voting options will be WHITE, BLUE, BLACK, RED, and ARTIFACT.

If you haven’t had a chance to participate in the last “You Make The Card,” I strongly urge you to do so this time. This is a chance to make decisions that directly affect the game. Please take advantage of it.

Voting begins on Monday!
