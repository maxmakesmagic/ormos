The surprise undefeated player, Sol Malka, considers himself as more of a successful writer than a successful player, and was recently voted by internet readers as one of the top four most popular Magic writers currently practicing the craft. His opponent, Mike Turian, was eliminated very early in that same writer's poll and was looking for revenge.


Nah, not really.


Sol's deck, "Kane," is a black-red monstrosity designed by himself and Adrian Sullivan. It features huge problematic creatures like Scoria Cat and Phyrexian Scuta plus tons of discard and creature elimination. The main differences between Sol's deck and most typical black-red decks is that he opted for Diamonds over Dark Rituals for his acceleration, and also had several sources of green mana to power up the kicker on his Thunderscape Battlemage.


Mike is playing a rather plain monowhite Rebel deck designed by himself and CMU teammate Andrew Cuneo. The deck features a 14-card Rebel chain, plus versatile support cards like Voice of All, Longbow Archers, Parallax Wave, and Glorious Anthem.


Sol won the roll and elected to play first. He led off with a Duress, and chose to take Disenchant over Parallax Wave and Glorious Anthem; Mike's hand also contained a Voice of All and three lands, but no actual Rebels. After some Rishadan Port battles that prevented either player from casting early spells, Sol Duressed Mike again on turn three, choosing the Anthem, even though Mike had drawn another. Mike then played the first creature - a Steadfast Guard.


On his next turn, Mike played the Glorious Anthem and attacked for three. Sol then brought out a Chimeric Idol - showing Turian why he Duressed Disenchant - and it ended up trading with Mike's Guard.


The game turned sour for Malka shortly thereafter when Mike cast back-to-back Voices of All, both with protection from red. Malka gained some crucial card advantage by double-kicking a red Battlemage to destroy the Anthem and force Mike to discard his Wave and a Defiant Vanguard. But the Voices kept attacking for four per turn, and Sol drew neither black removal nor any means to race the damage.


Sideboarding ensued quickly.


Turian 1, Malka 0


Sol struggled to determine the correct way to sideboard. His Scutas were obviously bad due to the threat of having them Waved out, but the cards to bring in weren't so cut and dried. He wanted lots of removal to deal with Mike's searchers, but still needed to maintain a decent offense to keep Turian's nigh-invincible Voices on defense. In the end, he ended up siding out his Scutas and Pyre Zombie for some burn spells and an additional Addle.

Mike had to mulligan his initial one-land draw in game two, but kept his six-card hand. Sol played first again.


Sol had a Seal of Fire and a Plague Spitter in play before Mike cast his first spell, a Glorious Anthem. Mike then cast Steadfast Guard, and Sol decided not to Seal it (killing it due to the Spitter's extra point), but attacked into it, allowing Turian to trade.


Sol then forced Mike to discard a Longbow Archer and a Parallax Wave with a kicked Battlemage. Mike answered with a Defender en-Vec, which looked to be important once Sol summoned a gigantic Scoria Cat on his next turn. Mike came back with the always-problematic Voice pro-red.


At this point, Sol had a second Thunderscape Battlemage in his hand, but Mike had no cards in his. Unfortunately for Sol, he also lacked the green mana to use the mage's other kicker on Mike's Anthem.


Things got worse for Sol before they got better, as Mike pulled a second Anthem right off the top, and attacked for four in the air. Sol finally drew a Karplusan Forest and blew up one Anthem, then Duressed Mike's empty hand, just to tap out. Scoria Cat then served for six, but Mike simply blocked with his 3/5 Defender and used one fading counter to keep it alive. Not wanting to deal with the Defender any longer, Sol used his Seal of Fire on it to take away the last counter, forcing it to vanish during Mike's next upkeep.

Over the next couple turns, Sol's deck didn't cough up a way to kill the 2/4 Sivvi. He made an all-out attack with his Cat and two Battlemages (mana burning for two to gas up the Cat). Mike blocked a Mage and went to 8 life.


Malka was hoping to draw two consecutive Urza's Rages to complement his other Seal and finish Mike off. It was not to be, however, and once Sivvi started recruiting, Sol extended the hand.


**Final Result:** Mike Turian 2, Sol Malka 0


Turian is now the only remaining undefeated player in the tournament.
