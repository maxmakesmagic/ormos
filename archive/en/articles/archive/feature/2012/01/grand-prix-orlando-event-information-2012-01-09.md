![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/promo/grandprix_2012.jpg)*Get a promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).* Orlando, Florida. The name alone conjures up images of warmth, theme parks, and world-class shopping. And in January, it also should conjure up an image of world-class **Magic: The Gathering** competition. Just as Orlando has something for everyone, Grand Prix Orlando will have events for everyone, from the GP road warrior to your laid-back kitchen-table spellslinger.


Orlando boasts an average high of 71°F in January, so while the rest of the northern hemisphere is under blizzard advisories or huddled next to the space heater, you can be enjoying three full days of **Magic** wearing shorts and your favorite t-shirt! 


There will also be vendors from all over the country ready to help you complete those last-minute changes to your deck incorporating the new tech you just discovered. 


Also, to help leave more cash in your pocket for all the things there are to do in Orlando, Phoenix Games has negotiated a special rate for **Magic** players at the Wyndham Hotel. When booking your reservation, please call the hotel at 1-800-421-8001 and use the code ‘**Phoenix Games**’ to receive your super discounted room rate of **$89.00 and free parking**. 


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#1).*
