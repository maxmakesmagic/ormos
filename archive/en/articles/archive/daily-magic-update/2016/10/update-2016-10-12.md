The October 12, 2016 update
===========================



 Posted in **Daily Magic Update**
 on October 12, 2016

By Nicholas Wolfram




 Nicholas Wolfram fell promptly in love with tabletop and video games when he was only two years old, and he has been writing about them since he figured out how words worked. Now he puts together words about Magic, which he started playing way back in 2000. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 12, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [taking chances](#6).


Today's Must
============


1. [Standard Humans and Bold Predictions for Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33833_Standard-Humans-And-Bold-Predictions-For-Pro-Tour-Kaladesh.html) | StarCityGames.com | Todd Stevens

Reflecting on his 14th-place finish at the SCG Open in Indianapolis, Todd gives a frank overview of some necessary changes he believes his deck needs to succeed. He explores several different reasons why a Humans deck may be the best choice while trying to find the best color fit for the deck. He also makes some admittedly bold predictions for [Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptkld) that are sure to stir discussion.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [10 Overrated *Kaladesh* Limited Cards](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/10-overrated-kaladesh-limited-cards/) | ChannelFireball | Pascal Maynard

Riding the theme of controversial *Kaladesh* opinions, Pascal denounces ten of the cards that have been seeing frequent presence in *Kaladesh* Limited so far.


1. [*Kaladesh* Art Chat](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/mikelinnemann-10122016-kaladesh-art-chat/) | Gathering Magic | Mike Linnemann

Mike brings together four *Magic* artists to discuss the processes they went through to develop the art for some of our favorite *Kaladesh* cards.


1. [Sorry I...Didn't Finish Your Land Cycle](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/sorry-i-didn-t-finish-your-land-cycle-bonus) | MTG Goldfish | caliban

Two-color lands are essential to most Constructed decks, but balancing them has always been a delicate process. *Magic* has tried dozens of different ways of balancing the ability of a land to produce multiple types of mana, but only a handful of them have been implemented with every possible pair of colors. Caliban takes another humorous look at the balances that never received a completed cycle.


1. [Simic Guild with Andy Hull (Part 1)](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/2016/10/12/e067-simic-guild-with-andy-hull-pt-1-commanderin-mtg-podcast.html) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Nate Burgess, and Sean Whatson

Green-blue is a versatile combination that suits Commander well. With [Rashmi, Eternities Crafter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rashmi%2C+Eternities+Crafter) entering the format as powerful potential commander, Phil, Sean, Nate, and Andy decided it was time to give Simic a full episode of discussion as they go through some of their favorite spells, commanders, and strategies to play.


1. [Taking Chances, Not Risks, in *Kaladesh* Limited](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13557&writer=Conley+Woods&articledate=10-12-2016) | TCG Player | Conley Woods

*Kaladesh* is a set that encourages experimentation and thrives on well-engineered machinery (in more ways than one). Conley offers a pragmatic look at how you can be original and creative in *Kaladesh* Limited without sacrificing the effectiveness of your deck.


1. [Magic Math—*Kaladesh*: Dubious Challenge, Combustible Gearhulk, and More](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/magic-math-kaladesh-dubious-challenge-combustible-gearhulk-and-more/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

While [Dubious Challenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dubious+Challenge) seems unlikely to see much play in Standard at this point, the Johnny in Frank is ready to consider it for other formats. He brings the numbers to the table on how to make this card viable in Modern and then looks at the statistical power of [Combustible Gearhulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combustible+Gearhulk) and [Aetherworks Marvel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) in current Standard.


1. [Holistic Wisdom: Top 10 Life Gain Cards](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/freyalise/holistic-wisdom-top-10-life-gain-cards) | MTGMintCard | Freyalise

Life gain decks are probably always going to be my favorite (even though I know it takes a lot of good fortune to get them running properly). I used to love getting my life totals into the thousands and watching my opponents squirm with helplessness. Rather than rating cards based on their likelihood to net you a boatload of extra life, Freyalise looks at the storied history of life gain cards and chooses the best cards that *can* gain you life, which is probably the most pragmatic approach.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptkld), of course! Even the Uber drivers are excited!

Top 25
======


1. Márcio Carvalho and Sam Black climb the ranks.

Thanks to his victory at [Grand Prix London](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gplon16), Márcio Carvalho has leapt into the Top 25 at No. 22. Sam Black also performed well enough with his mill deck at [GP Atlanta](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpatl16) to move up four spaces.

Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Márcio Carvalho's Red-Green *Kaladesh* Draft Deck](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gplon16/top-8-decks-2016-10-09)

Looking at this deck, it is no wonder how it snagged first place last weekend at Grand Prix London. Starting turn two, the deck is almost guaranteed to be dropping at least one intimidating creature every turn. And with a nearly endless supply of energy for [Voltaic Brawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Brawler) and [Spontaneous Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spontaneous+Artist), this deck is going to be hitting fast and hard before the opponent even knows what's hitting them. Even without *three* solid rares for the build ([Pia Nalaar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pia+Nalaar), [Bristling Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bristling+Hydra), and [Lathnu Hellion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lathnu+Hellion)), this deck would be a hard force to counter, but all three made it an undefeated deck at GP London.
