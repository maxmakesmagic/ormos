As per tradition, one of the 1,147 players in the room was presented with a Sealed Pool that we had access to. While that player's deck has already been built, we are not ready to reveal it just yet. Instead, we offer you that player's Sealed pool.


With some powerful White cards – including two copies of [Hopeful Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) and a [Heliod's Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary) – how tempted would you be to go the Plains route? What color would you supplement it with? Would the Black [Abhorrent Overlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abhorrent+Overlord) lock you into Black? Or can the Green with two [Golden Hind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golden+Hind) be the way to go?


Give it a go and we will present you with the deck list of this named player at the end of the day.
