The *Magic Online* Community Cup is a team event that pits 8 representatives from the **Magic Online** [Community](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/259d) against 8 representatives from [Wizards of the Coast](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/261b).


Unlike in individual events where players must keep their thoughts to themselves, even if they have a strong opinion about what their friends should do – at the *Magic Online* Community Cup players are allowed to communicate with their teammates during drafts and matches.
