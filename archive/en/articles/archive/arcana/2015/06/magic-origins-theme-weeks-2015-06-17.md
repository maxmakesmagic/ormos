 When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he dreamt of a job making Magic cards—and now as a Magic designer, he's living his dream! Gavin has been writing about Magic since 2005. 






*Magic Origins* is right around the corner, and there are a few cool things planned for the Release you might not have heard about yet.


First up, of course, is the Prerelease!


IGNITE YOUR PLANESWALKER SPARK
==============================


Gideon Jura. Jace Beleren. Liliana Vess. Chandra Nalaar. Nissa Revane. Each of these Planeswalkers is at the center of the story of *Magic Origins*—you get to check out how their spark ignited.


And this Prerelease, you should take a chance to show off your Planeswalker pride!


You'll get to choose your Planeswalker in the Prerelease of course, but if you really want to show off some team spirit for your Planeswalker, come dressed in their trappings!


This doesn't mean you have to create some elaborate trappings to show off which Planeswalker you represent—though if you happen to have a Gideon costume in your closet, this would definitely be the time to break it out! There are plenty of simple things you can do to represent your favorite of the five *Origins* Planeswalkers.


Like Jace Beleren? Consider wearing a blue hoodie! Is Nissa your favorite? Pick up some elf ears and wear them with pride! Even just wearing an entire outfit of your Planeswalker's color and making it your own. Every Planeswalker can do it a little bit different. Get creative and make it known which Planeswalker or color you love the most as you battle at the Prerelease!


But the fun doesn't end at the Prerelease. In fact, it's just getting started!


PLANESWALKER THEME WEEKS
========================


Starting the Monday of each week after the Prerelease, there will be five consecutive Planeswalker theme weeks in WUBRG order—so Gideon, Jace, Liliana, Chandra, then Nissa. Not only will DailyMTG.com be decked out each week with plenty of Planeswalkery glory for that week's choice, but [your local store](http://locator.wizards.com/) will be too!


We're sending stores around the world some unique posters and items to put up to represent their theme weeks. Make sure to go in and check them out at Friday Night Magic each week. That's another great place to show up in your Planeswalker gear—or just use each week as a fun reason to bring a deck themed around that Planeswalker to the table!


And hey, if you still have your outfit from the Prerelease, this is a great chance to wear it again! You could even figure out something for each week that represents that week's Planeswalker to wear. Start planning now!


Go out, have fun, and represent your favorite Planeswalkers. There's no better place to be in the Multiverse then at [your local game store](http://locator.wizards.com/) as *Magic Origins* kicks off!
