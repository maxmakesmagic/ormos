*What's the worst deck you've ever built thinking it would be good?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_JaySchneider.jpg)**Jay Schneider:** That's a tough question! I write down decks before they ever are built, and I tend to keep really good records. To find the answer to your question, I took a stroll through my archives and found the following classic: "Taniwhageddon."

| Taniwha | Armageddon |

Taniwhageddon was an Erhnamgeddon variant I built using Diamonds (such as [Sky Diamond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sky+Diamond)) instead of Elves and [Taniwha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taniwha) instead of [Erhnam Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erhnam+Djinn). What could be better than a one-sided [Armageddon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) and a 7/7 dwarfing the opponent's 4/5? Well, winning is better, for one thing. [Taniwha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taniwha) was a turn slower than [Erhnam Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erhnam+Djinn), and it turns out that it's really unlikely to draw the three Diamonds needed to cast [Armageddon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) the turns your lands are phased out. Back to the drawing board!
