**Long May He Reign**


Add deeper layers of gameplay to your next *Magic* draft and fight for King Brago—or plot his downfall. The *Conspiracy: The Reign of Brago* set builds on the revolutionary abilities introduced in the original *Magic: The Gathering—Conspiracy* set, with new cards that affect the draft itself and new Conspiracies that twist the rules against your foes and those who dare oppose Brago. Trade votes and spread your attacks to manipulate the game in your favor.


How will you defend the throne?


This set is designed for eight-player drafts followed by free-for-all games of three to five players each.
