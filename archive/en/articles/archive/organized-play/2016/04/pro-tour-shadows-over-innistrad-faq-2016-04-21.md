Unravel the secrets of *Shadows over Innistrad* Booster Draft and discover the best decks in Standard by tuning in to [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi) starting tomorrow!


Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* Basics
========================================


Looking for some quick answers to what this Pro Tour is all about? Look no further.


* This Pro Tour is a three-day, invitation-only event featuring Regional Pro Tour Qualifier winners, top Grand Prix finishers, Hall of Famers, and players who have secured invitations through the [Pro Players Club](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-players-club), all competing for a share of $250,000 in a test of Standard deck building and piloting as well as Booster Draft skill.
* The formats for Friday and Saturday are three rounds of Booster Draft—three packs of *Shadows over Innistrad*—and five rounds of Standard Constructed.
* Standard Constructed recently saw a set rotation, meaning the following sets are legal for this tournament: *Dragons of Tarkir*, *Magic Origins*, *Battle for Zendikar*, *Oath of the Gatewatch*, and *Shadows over Innistrad*.
* All players with 12 or more match points (a 4-4 record or better) at the end of Friday advance to Day Two of the tournament.
* The Top 8 players at the end of Saturday advance to Sunday's single-elimination playoff.
* Sunday play is single-elimination Standard Constructed with players using their deck from Friday and Saturday, featuring a round of quarterfinals and semifinals before the final match of the event.
* All matches played on Sunday are best-three-out-of-five, with the first two games featuring pre-sideboard action. The quarterfinals will be played two at a time, with the live video broadcast showcasing the climactic games from each match under the camera.
* The semifinals will be played one at a time, capturing the entirety of their matches under the camera.
* The winner receives $40,000, Platinum status in the Pro Players Club (netting them invitations with airfare and hotel covered for Pro Tours through the 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons along with appearance fees), and an invitation to the 2016 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.

That means it's three days filled with plenty of excitement, as players compete for a hefty prize check and more!


When Does Coverage Start?
=========================


You can catch all three days of Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* LIVE on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at 9 a.m. local time (CEST). That's midnight PT, 3 a.m. ET, and 7 a.m. UTC. Video coverage lasts until the day is complete. To get notifications for when we go live, I recommend following our Twitch channel. And in case you're looking to watch the whole thing from start to finish but *don't* want to wake up at midnight if you're living in, say, Seattle, then fear not! We'll replay the whole broadcast once each day is complete.


Joining us at the news desk for the Pro Tour are Rich Hagon and Brian David-Marshall, two tenured faces of *Magic* coverage, and they'll be bringing you all the latest updates from the floor. Along with them are feature match commentators Marshall Sutcliffe, Ian Duke, Randy Buehler, Tim Willoughby, and Gaby Spartz. And—unless he wants to go and Top 8 another Pro Tour like he did last time—Luis Scott-Vargas will join us in the booth on Sunday. (And if he *does* Top 8, we'll find a way to add a little pizzazz to Sunday!)

Nightbot will be performing moderation duties in our Twitch chat, and will also be available for on-call commands if you want links to the coverage page, current standings, and more.


Where Else Can I Experience the Coverage?
=========================================


Aside from Twitch, we'll also be broadcasting Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* in English—*and* Japanese—on NicoNico, featuring [Pro Tour Charleston 2006](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/kajiharu80-puts-char-charleston-0) Champion Tomohiro Kaji, Akira Asahara, Masami Kaneko, and more!


The official [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* coverage page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi) is your one-stop shop for all coverage content, including Draft Viewers, articles, decklists, pairings, results, standings, and videos as they are posted to YouTube. Writers Marc Calderaro, Tobi Henke, and Josh Bennett will be joined by stat-cruncher Nick Fang, editor Mike "You're Reading This Dude's Words Right Now" Rosenberg, and team captain/DailyMTG Editor-in-Chief Blake Rasmussen.


The coverage page is also where you will find plenty of photos from the show floor, courtesy of photographer extraordinaire Craig Gibson, along with the Twitch broadcast. Bookmark that page, and coverage will never unravel from your grip all weekend.


When Will Decklists Be Published?
=================================


Ah, yes. Perhaps the most common question we get asked before and during the event. In order to prioritize tournament integrity, decklists will be withheld until Round 16 is underway on Saturday. After that, all Constructed feature matches and articles referencing specific Standard decks will have decklists added to them. Wondering which articles will get deck content by the end of the weekend? Just look for the "*Decklists will be available after Round 16*" text at the top of the page, and you'll know to check back later!


And then there's the big vault of top Standard decks that we publish, which includes all decks from players who went 6-4 or better in the Standard portion of the Pro Tour. Those get published Sunday, likely after the quarterfinals, as the web team crunches on getting all those decks up on our website.


Where Can I Find Out More?
==========================


If you can't glue yourself to the coverage all weekend, you can get the latest updates from Madrid by following [@MagicProTour](http://www.twitter.com/magicprotour) on Twitter. The latest pairings, results, and standings are posted there too!


Join the conversation using the hashtag [#PTSOI](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ptsoi), and follow the [*Magic: The Gathering* Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering) for photos, additional stories, and maybe even some live interviews from the show floor.


And of course, you can always just keep yourself glued to [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) for all the latest as it happens.


Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* is nearly here. I'm ready. The coverage team is ready. The players are about to be ready.
