### 
Gaudenis Vidugiris
vs.
Fabian Thiele


In 2011 Fabian Thiele has finished in the Top 20 at Pro Tour Paris and has earned himself a Top 8 berth here at Pro Tour Nagoya. But Thiele isn't a long-time professional *Magic* player who travels to every Grand Prix and spends forty hours a week honing his skills on *Magic Online*—rather, Fabian Thiele is a self-described casual player competing in only his second Pro Tour!


Thiele's quarterfinals opponent couldn't have a more different story.


Going into this weekend, Gaudenis Vidugiris, a lawyer who currently resides in New York, was on the short list of players whose names would come up when discussing the best player without a Pro Tour Top 8.


Despite having a job that requires a serious time commitment, Vidugiris is an incredibly dedicated *Magic* player who will do whatever it takes to play in a Grand Prix or a Pro Tour. Because he can't take much time off from work, Vidugiris will frequently take red-eyes to compete in European Grand Prix, arriving at the tournament site mere hours (or minutes) before the event starts, catching up on some much-needed sleep during his byes.


While these two players have taken very different roads to get here, they both find themselves just three matches away from becoming a Pro Tour Champion.


### Game 1


Thiele started things off with a [Myr Sire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Sire) and a [Blind Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Zealot) while Vidugiris' first play of the game was a turn three [Strata Scythe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strata+Scythe), exiling a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). On Vidugiris' next turn, [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) returned [Strata Scythe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strata+Scythe), which he then recast—this time choosing to exile a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains).


Vidugiris attempted to equip his [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) with [Strata Scythe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strata+Scythe), but [Grim Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Affliction) took it out. Vidugiris cast a [Leonin Skyhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter), but that too fell at the hands of [Blind Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Zealot).





|  |
| --- |
| 
*Their philosophies are different, but both Fabian Thiele and Gaudenis Vidugiris are undeniably highly skilled players.* |


Thiele cast a [Reaper of Sheoldred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+Sheoldred) followed by a [Nested Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nested+Ghoul), while Vidugiris deployed a [Master Splicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Splicer) to restock his board. He followed that up with a [Leonin Relic-Warder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Relic-Warder) which removed [Myr Sire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Sire) and allowed Vidugiris attack Thiele down to 13 with a [Strata Scythe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strata+Scythe)–equipped golem.


But just as Vidugiris thought that he was starting to get somewhere, Thiele cast [Sheoldred, Whispering One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sheoldred%2C+Whispering+One).


Vidugiris needed to figure out a way to win fast, or else fall at the hands of his opponent's game-breaking rare. With that in mind, Vidugiris used [Remember the Fallen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remember+the+Fallen) to get back a [Leonin Skyhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter) that he immediately recast.


[Sheoldred, Whispering One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sheoldred%2C+Whispering+One) returned a [Blind Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Zealot) and when Thiele attacked with [Nested Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nested+Ghoul), Vidugiris chose not to block knowing that his opponent would simply be able to get it back on the following turn thanks to [Sheoldred, Whispering One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sheoldred%2C+Whispering+One). Thiele then cast an [Iron Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr) and passed the turn to Vidugiris.


[Leonin Skyhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter) then picked up a [Strata Scythe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strata+Scythe), allowing Vidugiris to attack for 6 in the air, knocking Thiele down to a precarious 7 life.


At this point Vidugiris had an important decision to make.


With a hand of [Inquisitor Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisitor+Exarch), [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter), and [Porcelain Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire)—and a board of four [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), two [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s, a 6/6 [Leonin Skyhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter), and a 3/3 Golem token—Vidugiris would be able to kill Thiele on his next turn provided that Thiele didn't cast anything to stop the [Leonin Skyhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter).


If Thiele—whose board was highlighted by a bunch of [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s, a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), an [Iron Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr), a [Sheoldred, Whispering One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sheoldred%2C+Whispering+One), and a [Blind Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Zealot)—drew something like [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) or [Spread the Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spread+the+Sickness), then Thiele would (almost certainly) win regardless of what play Vidugiris made.


If Vidugiris used his [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) to destroy Thiele's freshly cast [Iron Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr), that would prevent Thiele from being able to cast any double-R spells such as [Turn to Slag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Slag) or [Into the Core](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Core) he might be holding (unless he drew a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain))—but, thanks to his opponent's [Blind Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Zealot), it would also leave Vidugiris vulnerable to a subset of removal spells such as [Gremlin Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gremlin+Mine), or anything that could deal a single point of damage (or reduce a creature's toughness by 1), which he would *not* be vulnerable to if he cast his [Porcelain Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire).


If Vidugiris didn't think that his opponent had anything in his hand, then it would definitely be correct to cast the [Porcelain Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire), as that would give his opponent fewer outs. However, Thiele hadn't had any opportunity to cast double-R spells before this point (since his [Iron Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr) had just come down on the previous turn).


After weighing his options for a while, Vidugiris opted to cast the [Porcelain Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire). This decision backfired the next turn when Thiele used a [Turn to Slag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Slag) to take out [Leonin Skyhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter) and [Strata Scythe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strata+Scythe). From that point on, Vidugiris could do little more than sit and watch as Thiele poisoned him to death over the next few turns.


Thiele 1, Vidugiris 0


### Game 2


Vidugiris chose to play first, but had to mulligan to six. Vidugiris missed his third land drop for several turns, but Thiele also found himself stuck on a mere three lands.


 




|  |
| --- |
| 
*Thiele shows no sign of letting the pressure get to him.* |


 

Despite being stuck on three lands, Thiele was able to build up his board with [Vulshok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica), [Blind Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Zealot), [Gremlin Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gremlin+Mine), and [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet). Meanwhile, Vidugiris could only cast a couple of [Immolating Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immolating+Souleater)s and a [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk).


[Grim Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Affliction) took out Vidugiris's [Immolating Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immolating+Souleater), but a [Perilous Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) threatened to make things a bit complicated for Thiele, who was trying to beat the mana-screwed Vidugiris quickly. Nonetheless, a couple of [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) activations allowed Thiele to attack Vidugiris down to 10.


Vidugiris finally drew his third land and sacrificed his [Perilous Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) to [Kuldotha Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Rebirth), destroying Thiele's [Blind Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Zealot), before deploying a [Leonin Skyhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter) to his suddenly impressive board. [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) attacked, dropping Thiele to 14, and Vidugiris passed the turn.


At the end of Vidugiris's turn, [Instill Infection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Instill+Infection) took out one his Goblin tokens, and [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) tapped another.


Thiele untapped and cast a [Grim Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Affliction) to take out [Leonin Skyhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter) and add another counter to his [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)—a counter that he then used to tap Vidugiris's last untapped creature, thus setting up an attack with [Vulshok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) that knocked the American down to 7.


[Nested Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nested+Ghoul) came down for Thiele, and Vidugiris kept attacking with his [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk), knocking Thiele down to 12.


Thiele used his last counter on his [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) to tap down his opponent's freshly cast [Tine Shrike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tine+Shrike), then cast and activated an off-color [Flight Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flight+Spellbomb) to give [Nested Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nested+Ghoul) flying. A [Vulshok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) activation later and Thiele was up two games to none.


Thiele 2, Vidugiris 0


### Game 3


Vidugiris again chose to play first in Game 3, and again had to mulligan. Vidugiris kept his six and cast a first-turn [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) that revealed Thiele's hand of [Flight Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flight+Spellbomb), [Gremlin Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gremlin+Mine), [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell), and four lands.


[Inquisitor Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisitor+Exarch) let Vidugiris put some early pressure on Thiele, who spent his first couple of turns casting a [Flight Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flight+Spellbomb), an [Iron Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr), and a [Gremlin Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gremlin+Mine). [Blinding Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Souleater) came down for Vidugiris, and an attack on his subsequent turn with [Inquisitor Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisitor+Exarch) and [Blinding Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Souleater) knocked Thiele down to 13.





|  |
| --- |
| 
*Vidugiris is no longer on the list of the best players without a Pro Tour Top 8, but can he get further than that?* |


Vidugiris cast a postcombat [Immolating Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immolating+Souleater), and Thiele thought for a bit before ultimately deciding not to destroy anything with his [Gremlin Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gremlin+Mine). Thiele then tapped out to cast [Nested Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nested+Ghoul) and passed the turn back to Vidugiris.


Vidugiris, who now had an on-board kill, spent some time counting, and considering whether or not his opponent was trying to trick him into walking into a [Gut Shot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gut+Shot), before using [Blinding Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Souleater) to tap Thiele's only blocker.


"Am I dead?" asked Fabian, who was visibly upset about his mistake.


"Looks like it," said Gaudenis, who then attacked for exactly lethal by paying 16 life and tapping two [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s to pump his [Immolating Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immolating+Souleater) up to an 11/1.


Thiele 2, Vidugiris 1


### Game 4


Thiele chose to play first, and both players kept their opening hands for the fourth game. Gaudenis played a first-turn [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and immediately sacrificed it to [Kuldotha Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Rebirth).


"Very aggressive," quipped Thiele, who proceeded to cast a turn-two [Myr Sire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Sire).


"Not the card I wanted to see," said Gaudenis.


Vidugiris attacked, trading a Goblin token for [Myr Sire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Sire) (which left a Myr token behind), and then cast an [Immolating Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immolating+Souleater). Thiele cast and activated [Nihil Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb) before passing the turn back to Vidugiris. [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) destroyed Thiele's Myr token, and Vidugiris paid 14 life to pump his [Immolating Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immolating+Souleater) and knock Thiele down to 7.





|  |
| --- |
| 
*Thiele treads very carefully.* |


Thiele missed his fourth land drop, contenting himself to cast a [Gremlin Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gremlin+Mine) that he immediately used to take out [Immolating Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immolating+Souleater).


However, Vidugiris's two Goblin tokens kept biting away at Thiele, knocking the Deutschlander down to five.


Thiele failed to draw a land over the next couple of turns, and the players were off to a deciding Game 5.


Thiele 2, Vidugiris 2


### Game 5


Fabian chose to play and kept his opening seven while Vidugiris had to start off his deciding game with a mulligan.


A [Myr Sire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Sire) for Vidugiris was answered by a [Blind Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Zealot) from Thiele. But Vidugiris then looked to make up for his mulligan by casting an [Ichor Wellspring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichor+Wellspring) and immediately returning it to his hand with [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk).


[Blind Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Zealot) got sacrificed to take out Vidugiris' flier, and Thiele cast his backup [Blind Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Zealot) along with a [Gremlin Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gremlin+Mine). [Instill Infection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Instill+Infection) then took out an [Immolating Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immolating+Souleater), and from that point on it seemed as though Vidugiris was out of gas. Vidugiris cast a [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and a [Banishment Decree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishment+Decree) to keep [Blind Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Zealot) off the board for a little while, but things clearly weren't going to well for the American.


A couple of turns later a [Kuldotha Flamefiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Flamefiend) cleared Vidugiris's already light board, and while a [Turn to Slag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Slag) bought Vidugiris a bit of timem he didn't manage to draw anything during those turns.


**Fabian Thiele defeats Gaudenis Vidugiris 3-2 and advances to the semifinals!**
