It's October, which means Halloween has come to *Magic Online*! I'm sure you've noticed the steady creep of terrifying additions we've made over the past month. For instance, did you catch all of the graveyard updates that Chris Kiritz talked about in his *Magic Online* update [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online-update-delve-deeper-2014-10-06) a few weeks back? Speaking of graveyards, tip-toe past the tombstones towards the [MOCS](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/content/magic-online-championship-series#2014schedule) page and gaze upon this month's promo while you're at it.

Spooky


Yes, it's finally time to sink your fangs into those early-fall activities once again. Pumpkin carving? Check. Watching scary movies? Check. Working your list of cheesy Halloween phrases into articlesâ€”including gems like, "sink your fangs" and "lose your head?" Check. The only thing missing is some Halloween-themed *Magic Online* Sealed events.


Don't lose your heads, though, *Magic Online* users, Spooky Sealed is coming to *Magic Online*! The Spooky Sealed Queue features some of the scariest *Magic* sets to date. Rest assured, if you're a fan of werewolves and vampires, you won't be disappointed. The boosters in the Sealed pool are:



* 1 *Odyssey*
* 1 *Torment*
* 1 *Judgment*
* 2 *Innistrad*
* 1 *Dark Ascension*


To up the scare factor, this is a Phantom Event. In addition to the Phantom Points that all Phantom Events award, players who participate will get a promo version of [Tawnos's Coffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tawnos%27s+Coffin). Players who scare up three wins will win a foil version of the promo!
