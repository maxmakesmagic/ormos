As one of the *Tenth Edition* cards that got new art, [Commune with Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commune+with+Nature) was initially a blank canvas. The creative team wanted a new direction from the [commune with nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=commune%2Bwith%2Bnature), which depicted a blind kannushi (monk or druid) communing with an eagle familiar, and wanted to emphasize the sense that a player who cast it could end up with one of a variety of creatures.


They got what they were looking for. The new art shows a powerful scene: a druid performs a nature ritual over a circle of animal skulls, trying to call for aid from some beast of the forest. A large kavu (such as *Tenth Edition's* [Kavu Climber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Climber)) answers the call, its essence flowing through the tree behind her.


As you can see, artist Lars Grant-West illustrated the piece vertically, most of which sadly had to be cropped for the card. Here we show it to you in its full glory.
