Last year, [we shared some incredible promotional cards themed around the Year of the Ox](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/year-ox-store-challenger-series-2021-promos-2021-05-17) that were available through in-store events for players across Asia-Pacific. For 2022, we're excited to share even more awesome promotional cards, this time themed for the Year of the Tiger!


APAC League 2022 events begin with a season qualifier, beginning February 25, taking place at [your local Wizards Play Network game store in Asia-Pacific](https://locator.wizards.com/). The top two finishing players from each qualifier earn entry into an end-of-year championship event, and players entering a qualifier receive a promotional card while supplies last.


APAC League 2022 qualifier events can be held as a variety of formats—including Standard, Booster Draft, Sealed Deck—and feature a different promotional card throughout the year:


*Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Promo – Temur Sabertooth
