In today's [Uncharted Realms](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/guardian-2015-04-02), we learn the fate of Anafenza in the *Dragons of Tarkir* timeline. The fate of Anafenza, the Abzan khan of the *Khans of Tarkir* timeline, is very different with Ugin saved.



In fact, the fates of all of the would-be khans are quite different, and their art descriptions bear it out. Let's take a look.

[Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+Kin-Tree+Spirit) | Art by [Ryan Yee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Ryan%20Yee%22%5d)



Setting: DRAGONS OF TARKIR  

Clan: Dromoka (GW)  

Color: White creature  

Location: In front of a sacred ancestral tree, in the wilderness



Action: This is a portrait of ANAFENZA, who in this timeline is not the khan of the Abzan clan but instead a young woman who was killed for practicing forbidden ancestor worship. Start with the image of Anafenza in the *Khans of Tarkir* world guide. Instead of the clothing she wears there, use the updated Dromoka-clan armor motifs in the *Dragons of Tarkir* world guide. She carries the same long sword as the khan, but she holds it horizontally before her in two hands, in an attitude of watchfulness.



Anafenza is a spirit made of sand, in the old Abzan tradition.



This illustration is intended to recall that shown in the card [Kin-Tree Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Invocation) in KTK. This kin-tree is not planted in a fortress like those of the former Abzan, but rather is hidden among other trees in an oasis far from the cities.



Focus: Anafenza  

Mood: I bring you the blessings of the ancestors now that I am one of them.

[Sidisi, Undead Vizier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Undead+Vizier) | Art by [Min Yum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Min%20Yum%22%5d)



Setting: DRAGONS OF TARKIR  

Clan: Silumgar (UB)  

Color: Black legendary creature  

Location: In front of a Silumgar palace


Action: This is a portrait of SIDISI the NAGA, who in this timeline is not the khan of the Sultai clan but has become an undead sorcerer in the service of the dragonlord. She still plots secretly against Silumgar.


Start with the image of Sidisi in the *Khans of Tarkir* world guide and her card in that set. Instead of the clothing she wears there, use updated Silumgar-clan naga garb in the DTK world guide. She has an impressive golden collar but not the distinctive crown/hat of her previous incarnation. She is withered, with purplish glowing eyes, and her rich clothing is decayed; she carries a gold-inlaid staff instead of the adze-like weapon of KTK. Her hand is cupped under a floating human skull wreathed in purplish smoke.


Focus: Sidisi  

Mood: Dangerous and duplicitous.

[Surrak, the Hunt Caller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surrak%2C+the+Hunt+Caller) | Art by [Wesley Burt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Wesley%20Burt%22%5d)


Setting: DRAGONS OF TARKIR  

Clan: Atarka (RG)  

Color: Green legendary creature  

Location: On high ground in Atarka territory


Action: This is SURRAK, who in the *Khans of Tarkir* timeline was the khan of the Temur clan. Under the dragonlord Atarka, he is the Hunt Caller of the clan, responsible primarily for supplying the dragon with food. He is every bit as ferocious in battle as he was in the alternate timeline. Show Surrak much as he appeared in *Khans of Tarkir*, but with Atarka-style costuming as shown in the DTK world guide. He has NO FACIAL SCARS.


Surrak no longer wields the Dragonclaw weapon (the dragonlord ordered it destroyed). Instead he has twin OBSIDIAN BLADES, one in each hand, which he is bringing down in an overhead chopping motion. He still wears bear claws on his wrists, but they are longer and cruder, and their bindings are of unworked leather.


In the distant background we might see an ATARKA-BROOD DRAGON.


Focus: Surrak  

Mood: I will make you a meal for my lord!

[Zurgo Bellstriker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zurgo+Bellstriker) | Art by [Jason Rainville](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Jason%20Rainville%22%5d)



Setting: DRAGONS OF TARKIR  

Clan: Kolaghan (BR)  

Color: Red legendary creature  

Location: In the encampment of the dragonlord Kolaghan


Action: This is ZURGO, who in the old timeline was the khan of the Mardu clan. Under the dragonlord Kolaghan, his stature is greatly reduced, both politically and literally. Now he accompanies the dragon and sounds a great dragonbell to rouse the horde to attack.


Start with Zurgo as he appeared in *Khans of Tarkir*, but with Kolaghan costuming like that of an orc shown in the world guide. He is still a tough warrior but now has a more wiry build rather than the massive brute he was in the old timeline. He still has his heavy greatsword, but he is swinging it at a MAN-SIZED BRONZE BELL. This is crudely cast, not like the elegant dragonbells of the Ojutai clan. It is mounted on a special harness of a hordebeast, something like the falcon perch shown in the *Khans of Tarkir* world guide.


In the distant background we might see a distant horde of KOLAGHAN-CLAN WARRIORS (mix of genders if they are visible) or a KOLAGHAN-BROOD DRAGON in the sky.


Focus: Zurgo  

Mood: Get in there and fight!

[Narset Transcendent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset+Transcendent) | Art by [Magli Villeneuve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Magali+Villeneuve%22%5D)



Setting: DRAGONS OF TARKIR  

Clan: Ojutai (WU)  

Color: White-blue Planeswalker  

Location: Underground, bright torchlight, in front of the "Dragon Doors" shown in *Fate Reforged*


Action: This is a portrait of NARSET, who in this timeline is not the khan of the Jeskai clan but has followed a different path. Having reached true enlightenment, her spark ignited, and she is now beginning to explore what it means to be a Planeswalker. With the ascension of the dragonlord Ojutai, she has undertaken to wander the world. Now she is at the Dragon Doors that guard a repository of ancient lore. The doors are open.


Start with the image of Narset in the *Khans of Tarkir* world guide. Instead of the clothing she wears there, use updated Ojutai-clan garb something like that shown in the DTK world guide. It should have interesting, unique details, such as embroidered symbols (no real-world iconography please.) She strikes an impressive kung fu pose, balancing on one foot on top of a crumbled Dragon Door guardian. Try to use a different pose from her previous appearance. She no longer has the Jeskai Eye marking on her forehead; instead her eyes glow with mystical blue-white light.


Focus: Narset  

Mood: I have discovered secrets within me, and they have led me to more secrets.
