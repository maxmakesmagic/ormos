Conley Woods finsihes the trifecta of formats at Worlds with his Modern Zoo deck that maximizes the wide mana base in the format while adding key Innistrad cards [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) and [Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft). A deck list will be posted after the event.
