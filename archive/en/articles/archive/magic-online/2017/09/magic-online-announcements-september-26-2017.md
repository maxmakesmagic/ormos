**New Redemption process**


*Magic Online* will now process redemptions every Thursday morning between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. PT. Redemptions will no longer be processed during downtimes.


If you want to redeem a set, make sure to purchase the appropriate redemption object from the *Magic Online* store before this time. To ensure your redemption order is processed, make sure each card in any sets you are trying to redeem is in your account, isn’t being used in league or tournament, and isn’t involved in an active trade when processing starts, or that entire redemption order will fail to process.
