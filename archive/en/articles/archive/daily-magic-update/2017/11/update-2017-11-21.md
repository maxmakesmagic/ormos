The November 21, 2017 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 21, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by emptiness. The void. A complete lack of content.


There will be no Daily *Magic* Update tomorrow, and no new content at all on DailyMTG from Thursday (the Thanksgiving holiday in the US) through the weekend. I plan to use this time to find myself.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [A Planeswalker for the Modern Age](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-preview/ask-urza-2017-11-21)

It's such a pain to try and fit enough text on a planeswalker card to convey all the delicate mechanical complexity. Since everyone has pocket computers now, we figured, why limit ourselves to the space on one measly card? Presenting: Urza, Academy Headmaster.


Today's Previews
================

In honor of such a well-learned set of responses, we'll give you bookworms some more to dig into: Here's Novellamental and Animate Library!

Yesterday's book-themed Twitter challenge was so successful that it earned *two* book-related previews! Now I just need to convince my friends to let me use Animate Library in every one of my Commander decks.


1. [Gimme Five](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/11/magic-the-gatheringunstable-preview-card.html) | Paste | Cameron Kunzelman

I never imagined typing this sentence, but: I'm pretty sure this card gives octopi an entirely unfair advantage.


1. [Graveyard Busybody](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering.apac/photos/a.684754104926787.1073741828.681035948631936/1544069532328569/?type=1&theater)

This lady and her excellent tiny hat are obviously really cool, but should she really be allowed anywhere near a delve deck? Dredge? Reanimator?

Between them, these two videos truly have it all. Explosions! Infomercials! A warlock getting clubbed with a grocery bag! Oh, and two pretty awesome *Unstable* previews, too.


1. [GO TO JAIL](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/2017/11/21/e117-unstable-mtgun3-preview-card-go-to-jail.html) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Sean Whatson, and Shivam Bhatt

The shouty caps really add insult to your opponent's creature's incarceration.


Previews to Watch For
=====================


1. [Kelly Digges](https://twitter.com/kellydigges?lang=en)

Our very own Kelly Digges earned the chance to preview what's sure to be an *Unstable* Draft all-star by winning the Official Wizards of the Coast Marshmallow Sculpture Contest. We are so proud of him.


1. [MTG Mint Card](https://twitter.com/mtgmintcard)

Soon, MTG Mint Card will reveal a card that begs a very *Un*-set question: "Is . . . is that cheating?"


1. [The Trinisphere](https://twitter.com/TheTrinisphere)

Keep an eye on the Trinisphere today for a preview card you can really *count* on! (This is why people throw things at me.)


1. [TokyoMTG](https://twitter.com/tokyomtg?lang=en)

A preview card will appear here sometime today, and it will probably be in Japanese! But if you don't speak or read Japanese, don't worry—the information is highly classified anyway.
