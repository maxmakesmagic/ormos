The Phyrexian assault on the metallic plane of Mirrodin intensifies. The Mirran resistance rallies to survive and overcome. Both sides bring the full might of their arsenals to bear. As the fate of one world hangs in the balance, **Magic** players in our world get to enjoy all the wicked weapons this war has to offer.


Use **Magic Online** War Marks to show your allegiance, starting with the *Mirrodin Besieged* Prerelease Sealed Swiss Flights! Each flight will have two entry options, either 30 Event Tickets and a Mirran War Mark or 30 Event Tickets and a Phyrexian War Mark. The entry option you choose determines which side you are affiliated with and will drastically change which cards you get…so choose wisely!


To get you started, each player who has logged into **Magic Online** at least once in the past 12 months will receive 3 of each War Mark during the downtime on Wednesday, February 16. Additional War Marks can be earned by playing in various events over the course of the war, including each Prerelease Event you enter (and watch for additional opportunities to use War Marks to support your faction in the coming weeks). Choose your side and prepare for war!


The *Mirrodin Besieged* prerelease will feature three separate parts: Sealed Swiss Flights, 8-Player Swiss Draft Queues, and Casual Drafts. See below for more information.
