May 11 Banned and Restricted Update
===================================


The banned list for Explorer updates to remove both Winota, Joiner of Forces and Tibalt's Trickery from Explorer. Our [full banned and restricted announcement](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/may-11-2022-banned-and-restricted-announcement) has all the details for the change arriving to *MTG Arena* tomorrow.


The Arena Open Is This Weekend: May 14–15
=========================================


The next Arena Open is almost here, featuring *Streets of New Capenna* Sealed and Player Draft. You can practice now with the new cards to prepare for the event, which will feature two formats:


* Day 1 – S*treets of New Capenna* Sealed (Best-of-One and Best-of-Three)
* Day 2 – *Streets of New Capenna* Player Draft (Best-of-Three)

For this Arena Open, we've adjusted some of the gem rewards from Day 2 to Day 1, giving more players more rewards even sooner:


* Gem rewards on Day 2 for earning 0–5 wins have all been reduced by 5,000 gems.
* Earning seven wins on Day 1 in Best-of-One now also awards 5,000 gems in addition to Day 2 access.
* Earning four wins on Day 1 in Best-of-Three now also awards 6,000 gems in addition to Day 2 access.
* Earning one win on Day 1 in Best-of-Three now awards 1,500 gems, up from 1,000.

=============================


The newest Alchemy rebalancing changes arrived on May 5. If you missed the adjustments, [the complete rebalancing announcement](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/alchemy-rebalancing-may-5-2022) shares all the updated cards you'll find in Alchemy and Historic.


Family Means Business—and Festivals!
====================================


Get ready to fete the five crime families of *Streets of New Capenna*! The [Rise of the Five Families Festival](https://magic.wizards.com/mtga-snc-rise-of-the-families) explores each family's particular way of doing business and exposes how they ascended to the ritzy heights of New Capenna's upper crust.


What's in it for you? Here's the deal: you can score golden age showcase card styles that'll prove you're a big shot and not some chump with a lot of chin music.


Each event's format is Alchemy Singleton with Best-of-One matches, but with a unique emblem twist inspired by each family!

* Emblem: "Once during each of your turns, you may cast an instant or sorcery spell from your graveyard by sacrificing a creature in addition to paying its other costs. If a spell cast this way would be put into your graveyard, exile it instead."
