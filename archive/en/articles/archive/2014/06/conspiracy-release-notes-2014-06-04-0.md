The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new **Magic: The Gathering** set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://wizards.custhelp.com/).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed. Notably, none of the cards that have been released in previous **Magic** products are listed.


### GENERAL NOTES


**Release Information**


The ***Magic: The Gathering**—Conspiracy* set contains 210 cards (89 common, 68 uncommon, 43 rare, and 10 mythic rare).


There are 65 cards within the ***Magic: The Gathering**—Conspiracy* set that are completely new to the **Magic** game. Of these, 13 have the card type conspiracy (see "New Card Type: conspiracy," below), and these aren't legal in any sanctioned Constructed format. The other 52 new cards are legal for play in the Vintage and Legacy formats as of the official release date, June 6, 2014. They aren't legal for play in the Standard or Modern formats.


The other cards in this release are legal for play in any format that already allows those cards. That is, appearing in this product doesn't change a card's legality in any format.


Go to [Wizards.com/MagicFormats](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/resources/formats-sanctioned) for a complete list of formats and permitted card sets.

### Conspiracy Draft


Conspiracy Draft is a casual variant in which players participate in a booster draft with ***Magic: The Gathering**—Conspiracy* booster packs. After building decks, they then play in one or more Free-for-All multiplayer games. Conspiracies, intrigue, and secrecy add to the excitement and keep your opponents unsteady at every turn.


Conspiracy Draft works best as an 8-player draft that then breaks into two separate 4-player games, but it can be enjoyed with any number of players. It's recommended that drafts have no more than 10 players at a single table and individual games have no more than 5 players. If a draft breaks into multiple games, randomly determine who will play in which game. For each individual game, where each player sits is also chosen at random; it doesn't matter where anyone sat during the draft.


### Multiplayer Games


The main difference between a one-on-one game and a multiplayer game is that you have more opponents to defeat on your way to victory. Over the course of the game, you may make temporary truces, deals, and alliances—politics matter! But ultimately you're on your own. The other players are always your opponents, even if you've temporarily made peace with them.


* Each player starts at 20 life.
* The first time a player takes a mulligan, he or she draws seven cards rather than six. Subsequent hands decrease by one card as normal.
* Each turn is taken individually and includes all the normal steps and phases. Notably, the player who goes first does not skip his or her first turn's draw step.
* During combat, you may attack any of your opponents or any planeswalkers they control. You may even attack multiple opponents and/or planeswalkers.
* If there are multiple defending players, they declare blockers in turn order. Each player's creatures may block only the creatures attacking that player or a planeswalker controlled by that player.
* Play proceeds clockwise. That is, after your turn, the player on your left takes his or her turn.
* Your spells and abilities can affect any player, permanent, spell, or card in the game, no matter how far away from you they are.
* You win the game when each other player has been eliminated.

### Leaving the Game


* A player leaves the game when he or she loses the game.
* All permanents, spells, and other cards the player owns leave the game. Any effects that gave that player control of anything end.
* If the player controlled any copies of spells or abilities on the stack, those copies cease to exist. They won't resolve.
* If the player still controls any objects, those objects are exiled.
* Nothing can happen to a player that has left the game. For example, combat damage can't be dealt to that player, and delayed triggered abilities controlled by that player won't be put on the stack.
* If a player that has left the game is required to make a choice, the controller of the spell or ability chooses another player (or opponent, if appropriate) to make that choice.
* If a player leaves the game during his or her turn, that turn continues, even though there isn't an active player. The next player in turn order receives priority whenever the active player would.

### Draft Abilities


Several cards in the ***Magic: The Gathering**—Conspiracy* set have abilities that function during the draft.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/0rNgE9sOxi_EN.jpg)Cogwork Librarian  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

3/3  

Draft Cogwork Librarian face up.  

As you draft a card, you may draft an additional card from that booster pack. If you do, put Cogwork Librarian into that booster pack.


* Some cards have abilities that instruct you to draft them face up. These cards remain face-up throughout the draft, and any abilities they have relevant to the draft function at that time. Some of these abilities allow you to turn the card face down one time for an effect.
* Other cards have abilities that instruct you to reveal them as you draft them. These abilities have additional instructions that you complete as you draft the card. After you do what the card tells you to do, the card is placed face down with your other drafted cards.
* Some cards instruct you to note information as you draft them, such as a number or a player. This information is then referred to by other abilities that function during the game. This information is considered public during the draft and subsequent games.
* Some cards refer to a draft round. Most booster drafts have three draft rounds, each consisting of all players opening one booster pack and drafting all the cards in those booster packs. This term doesn't refer to games played after a draft.
* During the draft, there is no active player, priority, or stack. If two players wish to take an action at the same time during the draft, they do so in a random order.
* You may find it helpful during the draft to make sure all players draft and pass booster packs at the same time. That is, don't let booster packs "pile up" behind any player.

### New Card Type: Conspiracy


Conspiracies are a new card type found in this set. They start the game in the command zone, where their abilities affect the game, sometimes before it even begins!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/2XFEahngeU_EN.jpg)Worldknit  

Conspiracy  
*(Start the game with this conspiracy face up in the command zone.)*  

As long as every card in your card pool started the game in your library or in the command zone, lands you control have " ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif): Add one mana of any color to your mana pool."


* Conspiracies are never put into your deck. Instead, you put any number of conspiracies from your card pool into the command zone as the game begins. These conspiracies are face up unless they have hidden agenda (see "New Keyword: Hidden Agenda," below), in which case they begin the game face down.
* A Conspiracy doesn't count as a card in your deck for purposes of meeting minimum deck size requirements. (In most drafts, the minimum deck size is 40 cards.)
* You don't have to play with any conspiracy you draft. However, you have only one opportunity to put conspiracies into the command zone, as the game begins. You can't put conspiracies into the command zone after this point.
* You can look at any player's face-up conspiracies at any time. You'll also know how many face-down conspiracies a player has in the command zone, although you won't know what they are.
* A conspiracy's static and triggered abilities function as long as that conspiracy is face-up in the command zone.
* Conspiracies are colorless, have no mana cost, and can't be cast as spells.
* Conspiracies aren't legal for any sanctioned Constructed format, but may be included in other Limited formats, such as Cube Draft.

### New Keyword: Hidden Agenda


Hidden agenda is a keyword found on some conspiracies. A conspiracy with hidden agenda is put into the command zone face down as the game begins. You can turn a face-down conspiracy face up whenever you have priority to reveal its abilities.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/FxubxbbQ6t_EN.jpg)Immediate Action  

Conspiracy  

Hidden agenda *(Start the game with this conspiracy face down in the command zone and secretly name a card. You may turn this conspiracy face up any time and reveal the chosen name.)*  

Creatures you control with the chosen name have haste.


* You name the card as the game begins, as you put the conspiracy into the command zone, not as you turn the face-down conspiracy face up.
* There are several ways to secretly name a card, including writing the name on a piece of paper that's kept with the face-down conspiracy. If you have multiple face-down conspiracies, you may name a different card for each one. It's important that each named card is clearly associated with only one of the conspiracies.
* You must name a **Magic** card. Notably, you can't name a token (except in the unusual case that a token's name matches the name of a card, such as Illusion).
* If you play multiple games after the draft, you can name a different card in each new game.
* As a special action, you may turn a face-down conspiracy face up. You may do so any time you have priority. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Once face up, the conspiracy's abilities will affect the game.
* At the end of the game, you must reveal any face-down conspiracies you own in the command zone to all players.

### New Keyword: Dethrone


Dethrone is a new keyword that gives creatures a bonus for attacking the player with the most life.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/GqlIucGoKN_EN.jpg)Marchesa's Infiltrator  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

Creature — Human Rogue  

1/1  

Dethrone *(Whenever this creature attacks the player with the most life or tied for most life, put a +1/+1 counter on it.)*  

Whenever Marchesa's Infiltrator deals combat damage to a player, draw a card.


The official rules for dethrone are as follows:


702.104. Dethrone


702.104a Dethrone is a triggered ability. "Dethrone" means "Whenever this creature attacks the player with the most life or tied for the most life, put a +1/+1 counter on it."


702.104b If a creature has multiple instances of dethrone, each triggers separately.


* Dethrone doesn't trigger if the creature attacks a planeswalker, even if its controller has the most life.
* Once dethrone triggers, it doesn't matter what happens to the players' life totals before the ability resolves. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature even if the defending player doesn't have the most life as the ability resolves.
* The +1/+1 counter is put on the creature before blockers are declared.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, dethrone will trigger if the creature attacks the team with the most life or tied for the most life.

### New Ability Word: Will of the Council


Nothing happens on Fiora without the consent of the enigmatic ruling council. Will of the council is an ability word that appears in italics at the beginning of abilities that involve the players voting to determine what happens.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/q5uUZdfeHO_EN.jpg)Plea for Power  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

Sorcery  
*Will of the council* — Starting with you, each player votes for time or knowledge. If time gets more votes, take an extra turn after this one. If knowledge gets more votes or the vote is tied, draw three cards.


Although ability words have no rules meaning, the new keyword action *vote* has the following rules:


701.29. Vote


701.29a Some spells and abilities instruct players to vote for one out of multiple listed choices that determine some aspect of the effect of that spell or ability. To vote, each player, starting with a specified player and proceeding in turn order, chooses one of those choices. If an effect gives a player multiple votes, those votes all happen at the same time the player would otherwise have voted.


701.29b The listed choices may be players or objects, different effects, words with no rules meaning that are each connected with a different effect, or other variables relevant to the resolution of the spell or ability.


701.29c If the text of a spell or ability refers to "voting," it refers only to an actual vote, not to any spell or ability that involves the players making choices or decisions without using the word "vote."


* Because the votes are cast in turn order, each player will know the votes of players who voted beforehand.
* You must vote for one of the available options. You can't abstain.
* No player votes until the spell or ability resolves. Any responses to that spell or ability must be made without knowing the outcome of the vote.
* Players can't do anything after they finishing voting but before the spell or ability that included the vote finishes resolving.
* The phrase "the vote is tied" refers only to when there is more than one choice that received the most votes. For example, if a 5-player vote from among three different choices ends 3 votes to 1 vote to 1 vote, the vote isn't tied.

### New Ability Word: Parley


Even while at war, it often pays to stop and talk to your enemies. Parley is an ability word that appears in italics at the beginning of spells and abilities that have each player reveal the top card of his or her library. You take an action based on the number of nonland cards revealed this way, and then each player draws a card.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/eppWy0NKfS_EN.jpg)Rousing of Souls  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  

Sorcery  
*Parley* — Each player reveals the top card of his or her library. For each nonland card revealed this way, you put a 1/1 white Spirit creature token with flying onto the battlefield. Then each player draws a card.


* Except in some very rare cases, the card each player draws will be the card revealed from the top of his or her library.

### CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/zJ3Dpm6J0f_EN.jpg)Advantageous Proclamation  

Conspiracy  
*(Start the game with this conspiracy face up in the command zone.)*  

Your minimum deck size is reduced by five.


* In Limited formats (including Conspiracy Draft), the minimum deck size is generally 40 cards. With Advantageous Proclamation, your Conspiracy Draft deck must contain at least 35 cards.
* The effect of Advantageous Proclamation is cumulative. If you have two in your command zone to start the game, your minimum deck size is reduced by ten, and so on.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/YXPqCzJU8A_EN.jpg)Æther Searcher  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152843im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless7.gif)  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

6/4  

Reveal Æther Searcher as you draft it. Reveal the next card you draft and note its name.  

When Æther Searcher enters the battlefield, you may search your hand and/or library for a card with a name noted as you drafted cards named Æther Searcher. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. If you searched your library this way, shuffle it.


* When casting a card this way, ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," must be followed.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the card has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.
* If Æther Searcher leaves the battlefield before its ability resolves, you'll still be able to search for the named card and cast it.
* If the card you draft after Æther Searcher is a land card, you won't be able to play that land using Æther Searcher's ability.
* If Æther Searcher is the last card you draft in any draft round other than the last one, you'll reveal the first card you draft in the following draft round and note its name.
* If Æther Searcher is the last card you draft, there won't be a noted name. You can still search your hand and/or library when it enters the battlefield, but you won't cast any card this way unless you also drafted an Æther Searcher and noted a card then.
* If an Æther Searcher owned by another player enters the battlefield under your control, you can search for a card you've named while drafting a card named Æther Searcher, not a card named by its owner. Unless you also drafted a card named Æther Searcher, you won't cast a card.
* You cast the card before shuffling your library (if it was searched). In some very rare cases, you may need to take actions involving your library while casting the card. For example, if it has an additional cost and you activate [Deranged Assistant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Assistant)'s ability ("![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif), Put the top card of your library into your graveyard: Add ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) to your mana pool.") to pay for it, you must maintain the order of your library while you search it.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/PeiqisaMTi_EN.jpg)Agent of Acquisitions  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

2/1  

Draft Agent of Acquisitions face up.  

Instead of drafting a card from a booster pack, you may draft each card in that booster pack, one at a time. If you do, turn Agent of Acquisitions face down and you can't draft cards for the rest of this draft round. (You may look at booster packs passed to you.)


* You choose the order the cards in that booster pack are drafted. In many cases this won't matter, but it could be relevant if one of the cards cares about when it was drafted or what the next card you draft is.
* The second ability of Agent of Acquisitions works only if you're drafting a card. For example, if you've already used one Agent of Acquisitions in a draft round, you can't use a second Agent of Acquisitions later in that same draft round.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/F6xYrn92Zo_EN.jpg)Backup Plan  

Conspiracy  
*(Start the game with this conspiracy face up in the command zone.)*  

Draw an additional hand of seven cards as the game begins. Before taking mulligans, shuffle all but one of your hands into your library.


* The effect of Backup Plan is cumulative. If you have two in your command zone to start the game, you'll draw three hands of seven cards and shuffle all but one of them into your library.
* If, through a combination of Backup Plan and/or other conspiracies, you have fewer cards in your deck than you must draw as the game begins, you'll lose the game when state-based actions are checked during the upkeep of the first turn.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/2BnGO3zIX1_EN.jpg)Bite of the Black Rose  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)  

Sorcery  
*Will of the council* — Starting with you, each player votes for sickness or psychosis. If sickness gets more votes, creatures your opponents control get -2/-2 until end of turn. If psychosis gets more votes or the vote is tied, each opponent discards two cards.


* The effect will be the same for all your opponents, no matter how they voted.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/UKVMNPITB3_EN.jpg)Brago, King Eternal  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

Legendary Creature — Spirit  

2/4  

Flying  

When Brago, King Eternal deals combat damage to a player, exile any number of target nonland permanents you control, then return those cards to the battlefield under their owner's control.


* The ability exiles and returns all the targets during the combat damage step, after combat damage is dealt. You can't target any creature that didn't survive combat.
* You may exile Brago using its own ability.
* If you exile an Aura this way, the player who will control it when it enters the battlefield chooses what it will enchant at that time. That player may choose any player or permanent that Aura could enchant. However, the Aura can't enter the battlefield enchanting a permanent that enters the battlefield at the same time.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/vIg7w2e6MJ_EN.jpg)Brago's Favor  

Conspiracy  

Hidden agenda *(Start the game with this conspiracy face down in the command zone and secretly name a card. You may turn this conspiracy face up any time and reveal the chosen name.)*  

Spells with the chosen name you cast cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) less to cast.


* The second ability can't reduce the colored mana requirement of a spell.
* The second ability can reduce alternative costs such as overload costs.
* If there are additional costs to cast the spell, such as kicker costs, apply those increases before applying cost reductions.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cns/asdfsc3wfas234/3HfN53tZbc_EN.jpg)Brago's Representative  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  

Creature — Human Advisor  

1/4  

While voting, you get an additional vote. *(The votes can be for different choices or for the same choice.)*


* The ability is cumulative. For example, if you control two Brago's Representatives, you'll vote three times per vote.
* You make all your votes at the same time. Players who vote after you will know all of your votes when making their own.
* The ability only affects spells and abilities that use the word "vote." Other cards that involve choices, such as Archangel of Strife, are unaffected.

1/5  

Draft Canal Dredger face up.

* If you draft a card named Canal Dredger, you pass the last card from each booster pack to yourself. In other words, when you are passed two cards, you draft both of them.
* If multiple players have drafted a card named Canal Dredger, each player chooses which of those players to pass the last card to.
* You draft all cards passed to you this way one at a time. If you also drafted a Cogwork Grinder, you may remove any of those cards from the draft.

Draft Cogwork Grinder face up.  

As you draft a card, you may remove it from the draft face down. *(Those cards aren't in your card pool.)*  

Cogwork Grinder enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it, where X is the number of cards you removed from the draft with cards named Cogwork Grinder.


* You still draft the card that you remove. This may matter if an ability refers to "the next card you draft" or similar. If that card instructs you to draft it face up, do so, then turn it face down as you remove it. If that card instructs you to reveal it as you draft it and then perform additional actions, perform those actions before turning the card face down and removing it from the draft.
* A card that is removed from the draft isn't in any player's card pool. That card can't be played in any games associated with that draft.
* You can't remove cards from the draft that you've already drafted. Only cards drafted after you draft Cogwork Grinder may be removed this way.
* If you draft multiple Cogwork Grinders, the value for X will be the same for each of them. It doesn't matter that some of the removed cards may have been removed before you drafted the second Cogwork Grinder, for example.
* No other player may look at the cards you remove from the draft (unless Cogwork Spy allows a player to).
* If a Cogwork Grinder owned by another player enters the battlefield under your control, the number of counters it enters with will be based on the number of cards you've removed from the draft with Cogwork Grinders, not the number its owner removed. Unless you also drafted Cogwork Grinder, this will be 0.

Draft Cogwork Librarian face up.  

As you draft a card, you may draft an additional card from that booster pack. If you do, put Cogwork Librarian into that booster pack.


* Cogwork Librarian essentially lets you draft two cards from a booster pack in exchange for putting Cogwork Librarian back into that booster pack.
* The two cards you draft are drafted one at a time, in case one of the cards cares about when it was drafted or what the next card you draft is.
* You may use the ability of more than one Cogwork Librarian while drafting from one booster pack. For example you can draft three cards from one booster pack and put two Cogwork Librarians into that booster pack.

Reveal Cogwork Tracker as you draft it and note the player who passed it to you.  

Cogwork Tracker attacks each turn if able.  

Cogwork Tracker attacks a player you noted for cards named Cogwork Tracker each turn if able.


* If your draft is breaking up into multiple games, you and the noted player(s) aren't required to be in the same game.
* If the noted player isn't in the game, Cogwork Tracker's last ability won't do anything, although it must still attack each turn if able. This is also true if there is no noted player because Cogwork Tracker was the first card drafted from a booster pack.
* If the last ability doesn't apply, you choose which player or planeswalker Cogwork Tracker attacks.
* If there are multiple noted players, perhaps because the players on both your left and right passed a Cogwork Tracker to you, you choose which of those players each Cogwork Tracker attacks. If you control more than one, they can each attack a different noted player.
* If, during your declare attackers step, Cogwork Tracker is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under your control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, you're not forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.

*Will of the council* — When Council Guardian enters the battlefield, starting with you, each player votes for blue, black, red, or green. Council Guardian gains protection from each color with the most votes or tied for most votes.


* The vote happens as the ability resolves. Until this happens, Council Guardian doesn't have protection from any color. Spells and abilities may target Council Guardian as normal in response to its enters-the-battlefield ability, but not in response to the vote. Once players have started voting, it's too late to respond.
* If Council Guardian is not on the battlefield when its ability resolves, the vote will still take place; it simply won't have any effect. However, cards that care about voting (for example, Grudge Keeper) will still see the vote.

0/0  

You may have Dack's Duplicate enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield except it gains haste and dethrone. *(Whenever it attacks the player with the most life or tied for most life, put a +1/+1 counter on it.)*


* Haste and dethrone are part of the copiable values of Dack's Duplicate. If another creature enters the battlefield as or becomes a copy of Dack's Duplicate, it will copy whatever Dack's Duplicate is copying and have haste and dethrone.
* The ability of Dack's Duplicate doesn't target the creature.
* Dack's Duplicate copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below), except it will have haste and dethrone. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If the copied creature has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost (such as Grenzo, Dungeon Warden), X is considered to be 0.
* If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Dack's Duplicate), then Dack's Duplicate enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature is copying. It will have haste and dethrone.
* If the chosen creature is a token, Dack's Duplicate copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. Dack's Duplicate is not a token, even when copying one.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Dack's Duplicate enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
* If Dack's Duplicate somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, Dack's Duplicate can't become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that's already on the battlefield.
* You can choose to not copy anything. In that case, Dack's Duplicate enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature, and will probably die almost immediately, when state-based actions are checked again.

Draft Deal Broker face up.  

Immediately after the draft, you may reveal a card in your card pool. Each other player may offer you one card in his or her card pool in exchange. You may accept any one offer.  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif): Draw a card, then discard a card.


* You may reveal Deal Broker itself for its second ability. If you do, and you accept another player's offer, that player won't be able to use the second ability to offer another exchange.
* When you use Deal Broker's second ability, after you reveal your card, each other player chooses up to one card from his or her card pool, then all those chosen cards are revealed simultaneously.
* If you accept a player's offer, the card you revealed becomes part of that player's card pool and the other offered card becomes part of your card pool.
* The cards exchanged this way aren't drafted. They can't be removed from the draft by Cogwork Grinder, for example.
* If either card involved in the exchange has any information noted for it, that information stays with the exchanged card, not the player who initially drafted it. Any abilities that refer to actions taken as you drafted the card (or similar) now refer to the card's new owner, even though that player wasn't the person who actually drafted the card.
* If a player exchanges a card that has multiple pieces of information noted for it, all of the information is shared during the exchange. For example, if you receive a Cogwork Tracker from a player who drafted multiple Cogwork Trackers, your Cogwork Trackers may attack any player noted by either you or the other player for Cogwork Tracker. The other player will not remove a noted player from his or her remaining Cogwork Tracker.
* If more than one player drafts a Deal Broker, players who wish to use the second ability to exchange cards do so in a random order.
* If your draft is breaking up into multiple games, the exchange happens before it's known who will be playing in each game.

Enchantment  
*Morbid* — At the beginning of each end step, if a creature died this turn, you may draw a card.


* Deathreap Ritual's ability has an intervening "if" clause, so a creature must have died before the end step begins in order for the ability to trigger. Notably, this means that the trigger won't be on the stack for you to respond to by destroying a creature.
* You draw one card when the ability resolves, not one card per creature that died during the turn.

Conspiracy  

Hidden agenda *(Start the game with this conspiracy face down in the command zone and secretly name a card. You may turn this conspiracy face up any time and reveal the chosen name.)*  

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell with the chosen name, you may copy it. You may choose new targets for the copy.


* You must turn Double Stroke face up before you cast the spell with the chosen name to have Double Stroke's second ability trigger.
* When the ability resolves, it creates a copy of the spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) has), the copy will have the same value of X.
* Effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell will be copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. For example, if a player exiles three cards from his or her graveyard to cast [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying), and you copy it, the copy will also cause you to draw three cards and lose 3 life (but you won't exile any cards from your graveyard).

It's still a land.


* If the target land hasn't been under its controller's control continuously since the beginning of his or her most recent turn, that land won't be able to attack and its ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif) abilities can't be activated. In most cases, that means it will no longer be able to be tapped for mana that turn.
* This doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. The land was already on the battlefield; it only changed types.
* Ignition Team's ability doesn't affect the land's name or any other types, subtypes, or supertypes (such as basic or legendary) the land may have. The land will also keep any abilities it had.
* Effects that modify power and/or toughness without setting them to a specific value (like the one created by [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth)), power and toughness changes from counters, and effects that switch a creature's power and toughness will continue to apply. This may happen if the land was already a creature when the ability resolved.
* Copies of the affected land won't be 4/4 red Elemental creatures. For example, if the target land is a basic Mountain, a copy of that creature would just be a basic Mountain.

Artifact Creature — Construct  

2/2  

Reveal Lore Seeker as you draft it. After you draft Lore Seeker, you may add a booster pack to the draft. *(Your next pick is from that booster pack. Pass it to the next player and it's drafted this draft round.)*


* The booster pack can be from any **Magic: The Gathering** set, but you must provide it. Consult your co-conspirators for guidance.
* To add a booster pack to the draft, first pass the booster pack that contained Lore Seeker to the next player. Then open the new booster pack, draft a card, and pass the new booster pack in the same direction. Then you'll receive the booster pack you would've received had you not added a booster pack, and the draft round will continue. The added booster pack will last a few picks longer than the rest of the booster packs opened that draft round.
* Adding a booster pack to a draft may cause some players to have more cards in their card pools than others. This is normal.
* If you use Agent of Acquisitions to draft a booster pack containing Lore Seeker, and you wish to add a booster pack to the draft, first draft each remaining card from the Lore Seeker booster pack. Then open the new booster pack. You may look at the cards in that pack, but you can't draft any cards from it. You'll pass the new booster pack as normal. That was very generous of you.

Artifact Creature — Construct

Reveal Lurking Automaton as you draft it and note how many cards you've drafted this draft round, including Lurking Automaton.  

Lurking Automaton enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it, where X is the highest number you noted for cards named Lurking Automaton.


* For example, if you draft Lurking Automaton as the third card in a draft round and then another one as the sixth card in a draft round, each Lurking Automaton that enters the battlefield under your control does so with six +1/+1 counters on it.
* If a Lurking Automaton owned by another player enters the battlefield under your control, the number of counters it enters with will be based on the highest number you noted as you drafted a card named Lurking Automaton, not as its owner did. Unless you also drafted Lurking Automaton, this will be considered 0.

Legendary Creature — Human Wizard  

3/3  

Dethrone *(Whenever this creature attacks the player with the most life or tied for most life, put a +1/+1 counter on it.)*  

Other creatures you control have dethrone.  

Whenever a creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it dies, return that card to the battlefield under your control at the beginning of the next end step.


* If a creature has multiple instances of dethrone, each triggers separately.
* If the creature card leaves the graveyard before the delayed triggered ability resolves, that card won't return to the battlefield, even if it's back in the graveyard when the delayed triggered ability resolves.
* If Marchesa has a +1/+1 counter on it when it dies, it will return to the battlefield under your control because of its own ability.

You may reveal an artifact card from among them and put it onto the battlefield. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.


* The value of X is determined as the ability resolves. If, at that time, you control no artifacts, you won't look at any cards.

Reveal Paliano, the High City as you draft it. The player to your right chooses a color, you choose another color, then the player to your left chooses a third color.  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif): Add one mana to your mana pool of any color chosen as you drafted cards named Paliano, the High City.


* The three chosen colors must be different.
* If you control Paliano, the High City but you didn't draft a card named Paliano, the High City, its second ability won't add mana to your mana pool. Notably, Paliano won't produce colorless mana.

Conspiracy  
*(Start the game with this conspiracy face up in the command zone.)*  

You are the starting player. If multiple players would be the starting player, one of those players is chosen at random.


* If you have Power Play but aren't the starting player (because another player also had Power Play), your place in the turn order is unaffected. If you're sitting to the right of the starting player, you're going last. Not all power plays bear fruit.

Realm Seekers enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it, where X is the total number of cards in all players' hands.  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif), Remove a +1/+1 counter from Realm Seekers: Search your library for a land card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.


* If Realm Seekers enters the battlefield directly from a player's hand without being cast, it counts itself when determining the value of X.
* The value of X is determined as Realm Seekers enters the battlefield. Players can cast spells and activate abilities while Realm Seekers is on the stack to remove cards from their hands if they wish, and this will result in fewer counters being placed on Realm Seekers as it enters the battlefield.

Sorcery  

Each player sacrifices a creature. Put an X/X black Demon creature token with flying onto the battlefield, where X is the total power of the creatures sacrificed this way.


* You choose which creature you are sacrificing first, then each other player in turn order does the same. The creatures are all sacrificed simultaneously.
* Use the powers of the creatures as they last existed on the battlefield to determine the value of X, even if they were negative. For example, if the sacrificed creatures were 3/3, 5/5, 0/4, and -2/2, the Demon will be 6/6.

Flying  

Dethrone *(Whenever this creature attacks the player with the most life or tied for most life, put a +1/+1 counter on it.)*  

Whenever Scourge of the Throne attacks for the first time each turn, if it's attacking the player with the most life or tied for most life, untap all attacking creatures. After this phase, there is an additional combat phase.


* Scourge of the Throne's ability has an intervening "if" clause. It must be attacking the player with the most life or tied with the most life both when it's declared as an attacker and as it starts to resolve for it to have any effect. If, at either time, the player isn't the one with the most life or tied for the most life, the ability will have no effect. Notably, this is different than how dethrone works. (Dethrone checks only once to see if the ability triggers.)

*Parley* — When Selvala's Enforcer enters the battlefield, each player reveals the top card of his or her library. For each nonland card revealed this way, put a +1/+1 counter on Selvala's Enforcer. Then each player draws a card.

Instant  
*Will of the council* — Choose target instant or sorcery spell. Starting with you, each player votes for denial or duplication. If denial gets more votes, counter the spell. If duplication gets more votes or the vote is tied, copy the spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.


* If duplication gets more votes, Split Decision creates a copy of the spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) has), the copy will have the same value of X.
* Effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell will be copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. For example, if a player exiles three cards from his or her graveyard to cast [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying), and you copy it, the copy will also cause you to draw three cards and lose 3 life (but you won't exile any cards from your graveyard).

Sorcery  
*Will of the council* — Starting with you, each player votes for death or torture. If death gets more votes, each opponent sacrifices a creature. If torture gets more votes or the vote is tied, each opponent loses 4 life.

Draft Whispergear Sneak face up.  

During the draft, you may turn Whispergear Sneak face down. If you do, look at any unopened booster pack in the draft or any booster pack not being looked at by another player.


* If you look at a booster pack not being drafted during the current draft round, open that booster pack, look at the cards, and return them in a face-down pile.
* If you use Whispergear Sneak during the first draft round to look at an unopened booster pack, the owner of that booster pack doesn't have to "open" that booster pack for the next draft round, although he or she may do so.
* If you look at a booster pack that is being drafted during the current draft round, you may do so after a player has drafted a card from that booster pack and before the next player has been passed the cards. As a courtesy, you may inform the player currently looking at the booster pack that you'll be looking at it next, before it's passed to the next player.
