Over the course of the weekend, we have seen some great things in or around the tournament venue for Grand Prix Buenos Aires. It seemed only appropriate to archive these sights in a little overview. While this photo essay isn't going to quite the extent as the Pro Tours do, when Pro Tour photographer Craig Gibson is on site and at the ready, this will at least be able to provide a small glimpse into the fun and excitement of Agentina's largest Grand Prix if you were unable to attend.
