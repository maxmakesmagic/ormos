How did it go? How was your *Alara Reborn* Prerelease weekend? If you were like any of thousands of **Magic** fans, *Alara Reborn* is sure to have shaken up the game for you! So what will the new big decks be?

Checking in with opinions this week are all of the Premier Events from **Magic Online**. See what the final versions of the top decks in Standard, Block, Extended, and Classic look like before *Alara Reborn* enters the format and shakes everything up! Will Faeries and Five Color continue to be omnipresent in Standard? Will [Anathemancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anathemancer) change Extended forever? And will Classic find some new hits powerful enough to make a dent in the online world's largest card pool?

Find out first hand starting today [at a local Launch Party](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/release-facts).
