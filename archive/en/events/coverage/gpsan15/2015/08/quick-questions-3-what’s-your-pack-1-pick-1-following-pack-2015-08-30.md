*Craig Wescoe*


**Craig Wescoe:** [Avaricious Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avaricious+Dragon) - though [Reave Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reave+Soul) is the best common in the set.

**Christian Arenas:** Voidmage - the [Avaricious Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avaricious+Dragon) is too much of a colour commitment for a first pick.

**Tomoharu Saito:** [Avaricious Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avaricious+Dragon) - flying is very strong in this format.
