95 decks advanced to Saturday's rounds of competition. Blue/Green and Mono Black Control were the only undefeated decks in the field, but did the numbers in the second day field reflect the overabundance of these two decks on the first day?




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Green/Blue Madness: | 36 Total (37.9%) |
| Mono Black Control: | 28 Total \*(29.5%) |
| Psychatog: | 11 Total (11.6%) |
| Black Creature Swarm: | 5 Total \*(5.3%) |
| Mono Green: | 4 Total (4.2%) |
| Magic Colony RUB: | 3 Total (3.1%) |
| Blue/Black Beatdown: | 2 Total (2.1%) |
| Green/Red Beatdown: | 2 Total (2.1%) |
| Green/White Madness: | 2 Total (2.1%) |
| Reanimator: | 1 Total (1.1%) |
| Buried Alive: | 1 Total (1.1%) |

Mono Black Control and Black Creature Swarm were both counted under "Mono Black" on the first day.


The numbers pretty closely mirror the results of decks played during the first day. What percentage of each deck made day two?




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Buried Alive: | 1 out of 1 (100%) |
| Zombify Reanimator: | 1 out of 1 (100%) |
| Green/White Madness: | 2 out of 3 (66.7%) |
| Green/Blue Madness: | 36 out of 79 (45.6%) |
| Mono Black: | 33 out of 75 (44.0%) |
| Black/Blue Psychatog: | 11 out of 35 (31.5%) |
| Magic Colony RUB: | 3 out of 10 (30.0%) |
| Black/Blue Beatdown: | 2 out of 9 (22.2%) |
| Mono Green: | 4 out of 19 (21.0%) |
| Green/Red Beatdown: | 2 out of 17 (11.8%) |
| Black/Green Zombies: | 0 out of 7 (0%) |
| G/U/W w/ Enforcer: | 0 out of 7 (0%) |
| Black/Blue Zombies: | 0 out of 5 (0%) |
| Green/White Enforcer: | 0 out of 2 (0%) |
| 88 Card Traumatize: | 0 out of 2 (0%) |
| Green/Blue Beatdown: | 0 out of 1 (0%) |
| White Weenie w/ Blue: | 0 out of 1 (0%) |
| R/G/W Mystic Enforcer: | 0 out of 1 (0%) |

Since the decks to beat are Black Control and Green/Blue madness, it's unclear if any other games really 'beat the meta-game' so to speak, since there was such a small pool of alternate deck strategies to begin with! For instance, are the Buried Alive and Zombify decks metagamed breakers? Or did they simply get favorable matchups and win through surprise more than power? Since the metagamed has quickly been established to favor two specific decks, it will be very interesting to see how well the other decks in this field fare by the end of the day.
