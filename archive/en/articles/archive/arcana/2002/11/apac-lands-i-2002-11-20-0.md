A few years ago, we gave away promotional basic lands to people in the Asia-Pacific region as a promotion. There were fifteen such lands, each depicting a scene from various countries in the region in an attempt to connect players from that part of the world to the **Magic** universe.


The lands were grouped in packs of five. Below are the contents of one of the three packages. These, along with the [Guru lands](/en/articles/archive/guru-lands-2002-05-10), are some of the most sought-after lands in the game.


The Plains represents Japan, the Island depicts Hong Kong, the Swamp is New Zealand, the Mountain shows the Philippines, and the Forest is also Japan.
