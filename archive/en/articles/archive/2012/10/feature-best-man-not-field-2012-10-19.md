This weekend, four fantastic players of the game have received some very special rings. Kenji Tsumura, Masashi Oiso, Paulo Vitor Damo Da Rosa and Patrick Chapin were all inducted into the *Magic*: the Gathering Pro Tour Hall of Fame for their grand list of achievements in the game.


Tomorrow, there will be some more very special rings shared of a different kind, as American *Magic* player Paul Cheon gets married.


Paul isn't here this weekend. Understandably, he has other things on his mind right now. However, Luis Scott-Vargas, one of his best friends and a member of the wedding party, is currently playing as part of Team [Channel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel)[Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball). Right now he's in Seattle, and on Sunday, he would need to be in Los Angeles.

*Luis Scott-Vargas is going to have a magical Sunday no matter what. If he ends up losing a few matches today, he will be heading down to Los Angeles so he can see Paul Cheon, American Magic player and one of Scott-Vargas's best friends, get married.*
Â 

Suffice to say, this is going to be a big weekend for Scott-Vargas, one way or another. Right now he's playing his heart out, but doing so in the knowledge that once he picks up a few losses, he will be heading due south to celebrate the wedding. A flight is booked for Saturday morning, and there is a fair chance Luis will be on it.


"Once I find myself worse than X-2, I have a very easy decision to make," smiled Scott-Vargas. "The trickier decision is what I do when I'm playing against a teammate earlier on in the competition." Realistically, there is a very real chance that LSV will be on a plane tomorrow, and if he's faced with matchups against team mates, that means that he might decide that a concession to them before donning his suit and heading to Los Angeles is the right call.


Cheon understands that the timing of his wedding makes Scott-Vargas's weekend busier than what might have been ideal, but numerology had helped pick out an auspicious day for his wedding, meaning that this is when it had to be. As Pro Tour Sundays go, one way or another, Scott-Vargas knows that this one is going to be among the most magical.
