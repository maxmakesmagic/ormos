Consider the mighty [Terastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terastodon). Here's the art description that was sent to Lars Grant-West.



> Location: Forest clearing, or towering over some treetops   
>  Action: This is a mega-huge, fantasy pachyderm -- the lord of all the hugest mammals. Show it as a sort of cross between a rhino and an elephant -- tusks, nose horn(s), plates of armor, and thick round feet -- charging aggressively or rearing back over the treetops. It's definitely a fantasy creature -- perhaps it has six spiraling tusks, or a clawed trunk, or a partially bipedal stance.   
>  Focus: The pachyderm-lord   
>  Mood: Ultimate strength, ferocity, and destructiveness
>

And here's the sketch Lars turned in. You also get to see what [Terastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terastodon) was called at that point in the process!

The creative team liked the direction and gave the go-ahead. Here's the final version, as seen in packs of *Worldwake*.
