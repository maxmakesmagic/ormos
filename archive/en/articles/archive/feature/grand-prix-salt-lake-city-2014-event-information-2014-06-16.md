**Tournament Structure**


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of a maximum of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 6 Swiss rounds and the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 playoff matches will have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

(For Grand Prix Salt Lake City, the cutoff date will be Wednesday, September 3.) Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria:

**NOTE:**
  
 Grand Prix Salt Lake City is the first Grand Prix to take place in Season 4 of the 2014 Competitive Year. As a result, Competitive Point totals from events that took place in the 2014 Seasonal Award Season #2 (March 10, 2014 – June 1, 2014) will not count toward byes for the tournament. For details on point totals, season, and byes, please refer to the [Planeswalker Points site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/planeswalkerpoints). 


**Trial winners**
  
 Winners of a Trial tournament are awarded two byes in the Grand Prix that it feeds. Trial byes are not cumulative with other byes and do not pass down. Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players who accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds. For complete information about Grand Prix byes and their corresponding competitive season, please check the [Magic Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://www.wizards.com/wpn/Document.aspx?x=Magic_The_Gathering_Premier_Event_Invitation_Policy).
