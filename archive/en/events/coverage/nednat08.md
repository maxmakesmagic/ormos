Tom van Lamoen is the 2008 Netherlands National Champion!


Tom defeated Hugo de Jong in a five-game finals to earn the trophy and the spot as the captain of the national team. Joining Tom and Hugo on the squad for 2008 Worlds is Robert van Medevoort, who defeated Frank Karsten in the playoff for the final spot. Van Medevoort knows a thing or two about Worlds team play, having been part of the 2006 World Champion team with Julien Nuijten and Kamiel Cornelissen.
