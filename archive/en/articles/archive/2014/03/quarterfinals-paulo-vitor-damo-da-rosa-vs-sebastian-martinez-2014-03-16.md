 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 






 Considering the way Brazilian Hall of Famer Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa has been running lately, this Top 8 had to mean a lot to him. He has had quite a rough streak as of late, something which has certainly been affecting his confidence. Still, making a Top 8 here at Buenos Aires, in front of a legion of Brazilian players, has to have perked him up some. His opponent, Uruguays's Sebastian Martinez, has been on the opposite run recently. After finding his deck on a random **Magic** Twitch.tv stream, he picked it up, won a PTQ with the deck, and has managed to make it all the way to the Top 8 here, just across la Rio de la Plata. One more win would mean a qualification for Pro Tour **Magic** 2015 in Portland, but he was going to have to fight through one of the strongest players in the history of the game to get it. Fortunately for him, he had done just that in Round 14, defeating Damo da Rosa to eventually earn his place in the Top 8.




**The Decks**



Damo da Rosa has chosen to go with Esper Control for Grand Prix Buenos Aires, no big surprise given his history with the deck. Still, he has been disillusioned with it in recent weeks, as he has said that it feels like he can never seem to win with the deck, but can't ever seem to beat it when he plays against it. If his Top 8 appearance is any indication, it appears that he and the deck have hashed out their differences, as he stands ready to try for his second Grand Prix title.
