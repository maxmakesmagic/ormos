By Wizards of the Coast











![Segovian Leviathan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Segovian+Leviathan)**[Segovian Leviathan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Segovian+Leviathan)** – *Legends* uncommon. The *Planechase* plane The Hippodrome (which gives all creatures -5/-0) is located on Segovia, a plane known only for [Segovian Leviathan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Segovian+Leviathan). The idea is that everything on that plane is so small that even the Leviathans are 3/3. And look at those teeny little whales!
 ![Mana Drain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mana+Drain)**[Mana Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Drain)** – *Legends* uncommon. Did you know that the little creatures on [Mana Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Drain) are whelks? We didn't either, until *Time Spiral*'s [Draining Whelk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draining+Whelk) gave us a better look at them!
 This card is in [Masters Edition 3](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/mastersed3/productinfo), available only on **Magic Online**!


![Bazaar of Baghdad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad)**[Bazaar of Baghdad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad)** – *Arabian Nights* uncommon. Baghdad is, of course, the central setting for many of the tales of The Arabian Nights. Founded in 762 A.D. by Abu Jafar al-Mansur, the city of Baghdad was originally built on the west bank of the Tigris River and was called Madinat as-Salam (City of Peace).

![Zodiac Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zodiac+Dragon)**[Zodiac Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zodiac+Dragon)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* rare. [Zodiac Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zodiac+Dragon) is part of a twelve-card cycle, spread across three colors in *Portal Three Kingdoms*. It breaks many of the "rules" for cycles: it's not evenly spread across colors (there are three black cards, three red cards, and six green cards) and all the cards except [Zodiac Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zodiac+Dragon) have landwalk.

![Black Vise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Black+Vise)**[Black Vise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Vise)** – *Limited Edition Beta* rare. Years ago, Wizards of the Coast used to have costumes for some of its convention-attending employees. Some of those costumes are [visible here](/en/articles/archive/magic-convention-costumes-2008-05-19), but there's one missing: the Stuffy Doll from [The Rack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Rack) and [Black Vise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Vise) (and eventually [Stuffy Doll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy+Doll)). That costume was retired when one employee almost passed out while wearing it during an especially warm Gen Con.

![Volcanic Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Volcanic+Island)**[Volcanic Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Island)** – *Limited Edition Beta* rare. One of the most anticipated cards in *Beta* was [Volcanic Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Island), which had been left out of *Alpha*. At first, players just assumed that red and blue didn't get a dual land for flavor reasons. They also assumed this was the reason for the lack of [Circle of Protection: Black](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Black), but were happy to welcome both cards when they made their belated appearance.

![Balthor the Defiled](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Balthor+the+Defiled)**[Balthor the Defiled](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balthor+the+Defiled)** – *Judgment* rare. Balthor (in his [Balthor the Stout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Balthor%2Bthe%2BStout) and [Balthor the Defiled](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Balthor%2Bthe%2BDefiled) versions) makes up 50% of the Legendary Dwarves of **Magic** (non-Changeling/[Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) division). The [Irini Sengir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Irini%2BSengir) [Reveka, Wizard Savant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Reveka%252C%2BWizard%2BSavant) are from *Homelands* and weren't even printed with the "Dwarf" creature type!
 ![Alexi, Zephyr Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Alexi%2C+Zephyr+Mage)**[Alexi, Zephyr Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alexi%2C+Zephyr+Mage)** – *Prophecy* rare. [Alexi, Zephyr Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alexi%2C+Zephyr+Mage) is an ancestor of *Future Sight*'s [Linessa, Zephyr Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linessa%2C+Zephyr+Mage). Don't believe us? Look at the staff!
 ![Teferi's Isle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Teferi%27s+Isle)**[Teferi's Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Isle)** – *Mirage* rare. If you play one [Teferi's Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Isle) while another one is phased out, you can get the benefit of always having one in play, since they'll never "see" each other and the Legend Rule won't get rid of them! It's probably easier just to play two [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s, though.
 ![Ixidor, Reality Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ixidor%2C+Reality+Sculptor)**[Ixidor, Reality Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ixidor%2C+Reality+Sculptor)** – *Onslaught* rare. Ixidor is best known as the creator of [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath). But in the alternate reality where Ixidor is aligned with black mana, he's the creator of [Akroma, Angel of Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Fury) instead!
 ![Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Exile)**[Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exile)** – *Alliances* rare. Traditionally, inability to affect one's own color has been a trademark of black, usually in the form of "Destroy target nonblack creature". But it's occasionally been seen in other colors; see [Strafe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strafe), [Sunlance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunlance), or [Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exile).
 ![Jester's Sombrero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jester%27s+Sombrero)**[Jester's Sombrero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jester%27s+Sombrero)** – *Unglued* rare. Each card in *Unglued* has a bonus word on its rules text line, which can be combined to form a bonus joke. But did you know that the words sometimes tie in to the card on which they appear? Consider [Jester's Sombrero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jester%27s+Sombrero), which has flavor text spoken by a small Mexican dog. And the bonus word? "Chihuahuas". Fascinating!
 ![Toymaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Toymaker)**[Toymaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toymaker)** – *Mercadian Masques* uncommon. [Toymaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toymaker) is one of only two cards illustrated by Frank Kelly Freas, legendary science fiction (and Mad Magazine) artist. The other card illustrated by Freas is [Tidal Bore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidal+Bore), also in *Mercadian Masques*.
 ![Storm Crow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Storm+Crow)**[Storm Crow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Crow)** – *Classic Sixth Edition* common. It's relatively common for one card's name to be a subset of another's. For example, [Mons's Goblin Raiders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mons%27s+Goblin+Raiders) contains [Goblin Raiders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Raiders). If you're ever making a list of cards like this, don't forget that [Storm Crow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Crow) can be found inside [Mindstorm Crown](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindstorm+Crown)!
 ![Pradesh Gypsies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pradesh+Gypsies)**[Pradesh Gypsies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pradesh+Gypsies)** – *Classic Sixth Edition* common. Probably the most interesting thing about [Pradesh Gypsies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pradesh+Gypsies) is that it was the first card that Seshiro Ookubo ever used to make one of his amazing 3-D cards. [See some images of Ookubo at work](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2004-world-championships-feature-2004-09-01-0) from the 2004 Worlds coverage! And if you look carefully, you can see his original [Pradesh Gypsies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pradesh+Gypsies) card in there.
 ![Bottle Gnomes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bottle+Gnomes)**[Bottle Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+Gnomes)** – *Mirrodin* common. The blue liquid inside the [Bottle Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+Gnomes) is called "lymph", at least in *Mirrodin*. [This arcana](/en/articles/archive/sketches-bottle-gnomes-old-and-new-2003-10-08) speculates that the *Tempest* version may have involved some sort of Rath-based "proto-lymph". 
 ![Spoils of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spoils+of+the+Vault)**[Spoils of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spoils+of+the+Vault)** – *Mirrodin* rare. This week's Cards of the Day have been a diabolical five-card combo: Start by casting [Barren Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Glory) and then immediately exile it with [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring). Then, with [Lich's Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich%27s+Mirror) on the battlefield, cast [One With Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+With+Nothing) during the previous player's end step and respond with [Spoils of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spoils+of+the+Vault) for a card not in your library. When the smoke clears, you'll have [Barren Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Glory) on the battlefield, a life total of 20, and no cards in your hand or library!
 ![One With Nothing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=One+With+Nothing)**[One With Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+With+Nothing)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* rare. The art description for [One With Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+With+Nothing) reads, in part, "This spell purges all the thoughts from your head -- that's right, \*your\* head. Represent this however you want."
 ![Lich's Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lich%27s+Mirror)**[Lich's Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich%27s+Mirror)** – *Shards of Alara* mythic rare. Instead of providing our usual piece of trivia for the Card of the Day, we're just going to direct you to [this article](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/6) by Noel deCordova, which contains the coolest [Lich's Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich%27s+Mirror) deck ever.
 ![Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Oblivion+Ring)**[Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring)** – *Shards of Alara* common. The flavor text for the *Shards of Alara* version of [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) ("*A circle of light and a word of confinement.*") is a reference to the *Lorwyn* [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Oblivion%2BRing): "*A circle of sugar and a word of forbiddance.*". Clearly, no matter what plane you're in, oblivion rings involve circles and words.
 ![Barren Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Barren+Glory)**[Barren Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Glory)** – *Future Sight* rare. The "future-shifted" cards from *Future Sight* came from possible futures for **Magic**. But [Barren Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Glory) came from the silver-bordered past. It's actually a new version of the *Unglued* rare [The Cheese Stands Alone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Cheese+Stands+Alone)!
