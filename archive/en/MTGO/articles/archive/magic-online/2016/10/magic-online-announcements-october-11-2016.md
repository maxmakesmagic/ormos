**Reminder: No Downtime on October 12**


In an effort to make sure *Magic Online* is available when you want to play *Magic*, we’re working on ways to reduce the number of times we have to bring the system offline for maintenance. As a first step we’re simply going to eliminate at least one downtime each month.


Here are the dates of the exact downtimes we’ll be skipping in the second half of 2016:


* October 12
* November 2
* November 9
* November 30
* December 14
