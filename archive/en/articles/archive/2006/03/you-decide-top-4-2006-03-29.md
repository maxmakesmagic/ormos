Welcome to the Arena of the Ancients!


Before we get to the Top 4, let's see how we got here.


In the Top 8, we had 7 different expansions represented (*Stronghold, Betrayers of Kamigawa, Guildpact, Onslaught, Legions, Invasion,* and *Prophecy*) and a total of nine creature types (Sliver, Rat Ninja, Dragon Wizard, Gorgon, Angel, Minion, and Spellshaper). In the Top 4, that shook down to a Rat Ninja from *Betrayers of Kamigawa*, a Gorgon from *Onslaught*, an Angel from *Legions*, and an Angel from *Invasion*.


![Akroma, Angel of Wrath](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/322_akroma.jpg)### [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath)


The Hammerheim first seed strolled straight to the Top 8, taking out [Hazezon Tamar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazezon+Tamar); [Kokusho, the Evening Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star); and the overachieving [Tahngarth, Talruum Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tahngarth%2C+Talruum+Hero) on her way to face second-seeded [Phage the Untouchable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phage+the+Untouchable) in a highly anticipated match. Phage had arrived at the party fresh from defeating [Isamaru, Hound of Konda](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isamaru%2C+Hound+of+Konda); the [Ghost Council of Orzhova](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Council+of+Orzhova); and [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror). Phage's tune-up fights (a dog, a bunch of ghostly bureaucrats, and a foggy mirror) failed to provide enough training, and Akroma won, showing that after all is said and done, an "Angel" is more powerful than a "Minion".

> Background: Created from the arm of the mage Ixidor and made in the image of his fallen beloved, Akroma's primary task was to eradicate Phage. She was the general of the Southern Order, the mighty army that routed the forces of Krosa and Cabal, and her Vengeance is well known, as is her Blessing.


![Ink-Eyes, Servant of Oni](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/322_inkeyes.jpg)### [Ink-Eyes, Servant of Oni](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ink-Eyes%2C+Servant+of+Oni)


Top Seed [Sliver Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen)'s run to the Top 4 ran into a roadblock in the form of a Rat Ninja. Ink-Eyes had faced a murderer's row of superpowerful opponents: [Memnarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch); [Arcanis the Omnipotent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcanis+the+Omnipotent) (he's *omnipotent!*); and [Circu, Dimir Lobotomist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circu%2C+Dimir+Lobotomist) before defeating the mighty five-colored Queen. The Queen had soundly defeated play-in game winner [Vhati il-Dal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vhati+il-Dal); [Silvos, Rogue Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvos%2C+Rogue+Elemental); and [Rorix Bladewing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix+Bladewing).

Oh, and she's been [a wallpaper](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-ink-eyes-servant-oni-2005-01-07).


![Visara the Dreadful](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/322_visara.jpg)### [Visara the Dreadful](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful)


The last remaining Pit Fighter in the competition started off by beating [Johan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Johan) and [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree) before taking it up a notch and slaying two dragons back-to-back. First [Yosei, the Morning Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yosei%2C+the+Morning+Star) went down, and then [Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niv-Mizzet%2C+the+Firemind)'s run ended in the Top 8. Niv-Mizzet had beaten [Kataki, War's Wage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kataki%2C+War%27s+Wage); [Mirri, Cat Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirri%2C+Cat+Warrior); and [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker), facing an unprecedented number of Ks and Rs in his opponent's names.

> Background: After Chainer destroyed the Cabal's original base of operations (in *Torment*), they moved to their southern city of Aphetto, constructing a Grand Coliseum to hold bigger and better pit fights than ever before. They needed more spectators and fighters, so they opened their doors to the rest of Dominaria, and hordes of beings flooded into Otaria. Visara was one of the most feared fighters in the Pits.


![Reya Dawnbringer](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/322_reya.jpg)### [Reya Dawnbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reya+Dawnbringer)


Pendelhaven started off as the Region of Upsets, and it carried that tradition all the way to the Top 8, where Reya (a fourth seed) faced off against eleventh-seed [Mageta the Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mageta+the+Lion). Reya had faced a reasonably easy set of opponents, dispatching [Godo, Bandit Warlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godo%2C+Bandit+Warlord); [Volrath the Fallen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath+the+Fallen); and [Keiga, the Tide Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+the+Tide+Star), each of whom had won an upset victory in the first round. Mageta took a harder road, knocking off [Karn, Silver Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn%2C+Silver+Golem) and the [Ascendant Evincar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascendant+Evincar) before a stunning knockout of [Rith, the Awakener](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rith%2C+the+Awakener) in the third round.

Some speculate that she was one of the few survivors of Serra's Realm after Urza collapsed the plane into a powerstone that was used to fuel the skyship *Weatherlight*.
