The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on January 6, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by the full [*Aether Revolt* Card Image Gallery!](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/aether-revolt) Every card from *Aether Revolt* has now been previewed! Check it out!


Today's Must
============


1. [LoadingReadyRun Pre-Prerelease](https://www.twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun)

This is probably happening *right now*—if today is still Friday. The LoadingReadyRun crew has a bunch of community members—plus Trick Jarrett—up in Victoria building and playing with *Aether Revolt* for your entertainment (and theirs) on [twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun](https://www.twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun).


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [How to Most Enjoy Your *Aether Revolt* Prerelease](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34335_How-To-Most-Enjoy-Your-Aether-Revolt-Prerelease.html) | Adrian Sullivan | StarCityGames.com

Prereleases are about a week away, and no matter what you're looking for in a Prerelease, Sullivan keys you in on some secrets to getting the most out of the experience.


1. [Sram I Am](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34332_Sram-I-Am.html) | Bennie Smith | StarCityGames.com

Legendary? Check. Build-around-me card? Check. Name you can write puns with? Double-check. Sram, Senior Edificer has it all, and Smith is going to take that legend straight to the command zone and put Mr. Senior Edificer to work.


1. [*Aether Revolt*'s Fatal Push Will Radically Change Constructed](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/aether-revolts-fatal-push-will-radically-change-constructed/) | Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa | ChannelFireball

There are a lot of people talking about Fatal Push in a lot of different ways, but this is certainly one of the seminal articles on it. It's also the one that was posted in the past 24 hours.


1. [*Aether Revolt* Mechanics and Preview Cards](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-370-aether-revolt-mechanics-and-preview-cards/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliff and Luis Scott-Vargas

Marshall and Luis dive deeper into [the mechanics](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/aether-revolt-mechanics-2017-01-02) of *Aether Revolt*, discussing how to utilize them in Limited. Not nearly enough [legendary Monkey](https://twitter.com/ElaineChase/status/817159259028799488) jokes are made.


1. [Winding Constrictor Is Great with Energy](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/winding-constrictor/) | Top Level Podcast | Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores

The guys go deep on Winding Constrictor, a card that will surely *energize* a number of brews. Get it? Energize? Puns, amirite?

What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [Super Sunday Series](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2017SSSC)

Players from all around the world qualified for this very special tournament at Wizards of the Coast headquarters—and that's not even the headline. On Sunday, after a winner is determined, the whole crew will get to play in an *Aether Revolt* Pre-Prerelease—and you can watch! Coverage of the full event starts Saturday at 9:15 a.m. PT/12:15 a.m. ET on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).


What People Are Talking About
=============================

> How have you felt about the one-week preview week vs the standard two weeks? [#WOTCstaff](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WOTCstaff?src=hash)

A good question, and one I'd love to know people's thoughts on. So far reactions have been pretty evenly split, with some loving the near-constant stream of information and others preferring time to digest cards a touch more as they come out. While we don't plan to move away from two-week preview plans for our main releases (supplemental sets have always been one-week preview cycles), we are always looking at how we do previews. So send your feedback to [@blakepr](https://twitter.com/blakepr)!

It's always sad to see a longtime content creator go, even if it is on their own terms and simply because life had gotten in the way. We couldn't often feature them on here because their language is a touch on the mature side, but they always produced fun, interesting content that a lot of people loved.


So, for one last time: warning, the above contains strong language.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Black-Red Vampires](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34319_Tezzeret-Vampires-And-Nicol-Bolas.html) | Brad Nelson | StarCityGames.com (Premium Subscription Required)

Vampires never quite materialized after *Shadows over Innistrad* or *Eldritch Moon*, but Brad Nelson thinks now might actually be the time for the creatures of the night to rise. If you have StarCityGames.com premium, check out [his article](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34319_Tezzeret-Vampires-And-Nicol-Bolas.html) on this deck and a number of others with *Aether Revolt*.
