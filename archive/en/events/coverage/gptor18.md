Day 1 Coverage



We may be buried in snow here in Toronto, but Modern is on fire after a thrilling Pro Tour in Bilbao, Spain last week. More than 1,500 players braved the weather to make it here, including the world’s top-ranked player in Seth Manfield, along with Hall of Famer Ben Rubin, No. 15 Sam Pardee, No. 16 Brian Braun-Duin and more.


It was just a week ago that Luis Salvatto won Pro Tour *Rivals of Ixalan* wielding Lantern Control, but the format is more wide-open than ever on the heels of a Pro Tour that saw seven different archetypes advance to the Top 8. Players are sure to be packing their Stony Silence and Ancient Grudges this weekend, and all eyes will be on whether or not the quirky prison deck can run it back after its strong performance last weekend.


We’ve got the full range of decks on display this weekend, and you never know what’s going to pop up in Modern – after all, Lantern Control was itself once a fringe deck spotted in the wild at a Grand Prix.


You can follow all the action live at [Twitch.tv/Magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic)!
