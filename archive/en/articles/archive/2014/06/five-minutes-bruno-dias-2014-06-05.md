 I managed to snag 2013 MOCS competitor Bruno Dias between rounds for a quick interview. Here's how it went down.




**You've been pretty busy lately. Tell me about the last few weeks.**



Yes! Well, the Pro Tour, of course. I flew out to Atlanta the week before to practice. Then, after that, I stayed in Atlanta for the Grand Prix. Then I flew home and here we are at the team GP.



**You competed in the MOCS, but Atlanta was your first PT. What were your thoughts as you prepared for that?**



It's a whole other level! My goal was only to make Day 2. Of course I wanted to win, everyone wants to win. Nobody says 'Oh, I hope I lose!' But I thought that I could make Day 2, that was my first goal. After that we would see.



**And you did it!**



Yes just barely. Round 6 at 2-3 I played a match against the great William Jensen. It went three games but I won, that was a big victory for me. After that I thought 'Okay, I can do this'.

**You ended the tournament 117th with a 9-7 record. What were your thoughts then?**




 It was a mix of feelings. You know, anger at my bad draws, but at the same time... something like "Mission Accomplished". My last match it came down to a topdeck. I was going to kill him with my dragon, he had no cards in hand, and I was at four so I wasn't going to die to [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) so I thought I was fine. Then he untaps and plays [Harness by Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harness+by+Force). Bam. That's a thousand dollars and two pro points right there.




**That's awful!**




 That's **Magic**! You know I went 4-1 in Constructed on Day 2 so I can't complain. Although I did ask him if I could see his deck, he had two of them in 34 cards so you can do the math.




**Tell me about the week after the Pro Tour in Atlanta.**




 Oh that was great. I finally got to be a tourist, see all the sights. The first week, I was very focused, I would only play **Magic**.




**How did the Grand Prix go?**



I got 69th, not bad. I was 10-1 going into the 2nd draft and my pod had all kinds of pros in it, Saito, Wafo-Tapa, that awesome guy from Team MTGMint with three names [Tzu Ching Kuo], I actually beat him 2-0 in the first pod. The worst of it was that I thought my 2nd draft was even better than my first one but my draws just weren't there.



**After all that, this event has to be like a vacation.**




 Yeah you know it's always great to play a big event with your friends. My teammates Hugo da Silva and Paulo Cabral are also big **Magic Online** guys.




**So what's next for you?**



Well I'm going to be trying to get back to the Pro Tour. It's hard here, though. There are not many PTQs, maybe three a season. I'll be going to them, though, and the Grand Prix in Santiago. Also trying to Top 4 this event of course!



**Anything you'd like to add?**




 Well I just want to say, for me the best thing about **Magic** is the people involved. You know, people are so welcoming, at the MOCS, at the Pro Tour. I also want to say that I'm so grateful to Willy Edel for his help before the Pro Tour. He really took care of me.
