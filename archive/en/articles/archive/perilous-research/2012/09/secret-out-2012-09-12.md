Welcome to another week of *Return to Ravnica* previews here on **DailyMTG**. This week, I'm going to reveal one of the bread-and-butter Limited commons from *Return to Ravnica*. I'll spend a bit of time discussing the strengths of the card and the decks wherein it works especially well. Afterward, we'll take a look at the **Magic Online** Standard metagame. This week was especially exciting for **Magic Online** Standard players. Delver has remained the dominant Standard archetype since ***Magic** 2013* was released on **Magic Online**. Delver could not, however, pull off the perfect season. What deck or decks put up better results than Delver? Keep reading to find out!

[Ophidian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ophidian) was the best creature in Standard when I first started following competitive **Magic**. Players would bide time and set up empty boards to cast their [Ophidian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ophidian)s. The game basically ended once [Ophidian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ophidian) started hitting the opponent. Cards like [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) and [Forbid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbid) ensured that the stream of additional cards would be enough to prevent the opponent from escaping the prison.

[Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator) was originally printed when I was in high school. I played four copies in the sideboard of my [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) deck, punishing opponents who didn't have access to removal by pecking away, one card at a time. [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator) was a huge step up from [Ophidian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ophidian).

Since then, we've seen a lot of [Ophidian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ophidian)-style creatures printed. Three-mana creatures that let you draw cards when they connect have become a staple in both competitive and casual **Magic**. Cards like [Ohran Viper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ohran+Viper), [Cold-Eyed Selkie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cold-Eyed+Selkie), and [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief) have set the bar for creatures that attempt to make themselves into [Phyrexian Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Arena)s.

*Return to Ravnica* brings us a common [Ophidian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ophidian). Let's take a look at Stealer of Secrets:

![Stealer of Secrets](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/rtr/dqq98pcdap_en.jpg)  


Stealer of Secrets is going to be a great skill tester in *Return to Ravnica* Limited. This card's power level ranges from "meh" to "byah" depending on your deck. For example, a deck filled with cheap flying creatures that doesn't have much removal probably won't even want to play with Stealer of Secrets—a random opponent is bound to have a bunch of inexpensive creatures that can act as roadblocks and make the three mana you invested look silly. However, an aggressive deck with a lot of cheap removal or bounce spells is going to be drooling at the sight of a sixth- or seventh-pick Stealer of Secrets. Your opponent will either be forced to race or be forced to leave back multiple blockers for Stealer of Secrets.

Keep an eye out for Stealer of Secrets at your [*Return to Ravnica* Prerelease](/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-facts). Try to envision how games are going to play out with the sealed deck you're constructing. Then decide whether or not Stealer of Secrets deserves a spot in your deck.

Stealer of Secrets is a common, so you can often build a deck that takes special advantage of an [Ophidian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ophidian) before you've even seen a single copy in the draft. You'll probably get at least one Stealer of Secrets if you're willing to take it early, and if you take all the cards that work well with it, you might find yourself with a nice stack of thieves.

Standard
Now it's time to take a look at the **Magic Online** Standard metagame. Delver has posted the most 4–0 finishes every week since I started writing this column. Delver has been and remains the most-played deck on **Magic Online**, so its numbers might be a bit inflated. Nevertheless, the Standard metagame has been a world of Delver for a reasonable period of time.

The curse is broken. This week, Delver severely underperformed. It's still the most-played deck, but Zombies is significantly outperforming the white-blue tempo monster. Here's a look at the breakdown of decks that went 4–0 in last Saturday's Daily Events:
