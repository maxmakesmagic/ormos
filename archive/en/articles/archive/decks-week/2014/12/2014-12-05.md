Last weekend, San Antonio, Texas, played host to [a Standard Grand Prix](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsna14) won by Ryan Scullin and the Mardu Horde. Meanwhile, across the pond, Hungary's Tamás Nagy won [Grand Prix Strasbourg](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpstr14), in France. Congratulations Ryan and Tamás!



But Tamás Nagy isn't in France just for the GP. He's also there for Worlds Week, as a member of Hungary's national team. That's right, it's Worlds Week! By the end of the French day on Sunday, December 7, we will have our newest World Champion and World *Magic* Cup Champions! Catch all the excitement at the [World Championship](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2014WC) and [World *Magic* Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2014WMC) coverage!



And don't forget, PTQs begin for Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* this weekend, so [be sure to find a PTQ near you](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/qualifierlist) and win your invitation and airfare to the Pro Tour!
