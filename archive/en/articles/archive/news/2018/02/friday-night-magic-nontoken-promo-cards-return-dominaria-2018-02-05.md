We heard your feedback loud and clear. Starting with *Dominaria* on April 27, we will be returning to Friday Night *Magic* promos being nontoken cards from Standard-legal sets!


While the experiment with special premium tokens was aimed at fostering a fun, inclusive environment for Friday Night *Magic*, the real-world results did not match our expectations. That, coupled with the community's feedback, led us to change back.


Plus, we've got some cool cards coming up that look great as promos. We'll show them as we get closer to April 27.
