What Is the *Magic Online* Weekly Announcements Blog?
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20150913023540im_/http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/announcement_image.jpg)
Every Tuesday, we round up all of the biggest *Magic Online* news and post it right here in the Weekly Announcements Blog. Check in every Tuesday for all of the latest news!





*From the Vault: Annihilation* Released on Monday, October 6
Beyond Destruction Looms Annihilation. Harness the savage power of fifteen of the most brutal *Magic* cards ever unleashed.


*From the Vault: Annihilation* released on Monday, October 6! In case you missed it when it was first announced, read up on these powerful board clearing cards [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/products/from-the-vault-annihilation).





Continuing [Spirespine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirespine) Issues
During last week's downtime, we deployed a fix to address the [Spirespine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirespine) illegal blocker error on *Magic Online*. We've discovered that, while the issue is no longer occurring in most situations, there are still edge cases where the illegal blocker error is preventing games from progressing. We are currently investigating further and are planning to deploy a fix during the Wednesday, October 22, downtime that should eliminate the issue completely.





Products Leaving the *Magic Online* Store on Wednesday, October 8
On Wednesday, October 8, several products will be leaving the *Magic Online* Store. Both *Vintage Masters* booster packs and *Theros* block Intro Packs will be leaving during the downtime.
