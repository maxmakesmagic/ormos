One of the great things about Grand Prix tournaments is the opportunity for relatively new players to face off against established pros. Round Seven gave us just such a match-up as Daniel Higgs, riding the two byes he earned in his hometown of Sault St. Marie, Ontario and a solid Temur deck to a 6-0-1 record and a feature match against Dave Shiels. Shiels has had a ton of GP success and has been on the Pro Tour for four straight years but needs an X-2 finish this weekend to stay or he'll miss the next one. 


The players took a few seconds getting to know each other but it was all business once the dice were rolled and cards drawn, the only sound coming from either player was the shuffling of cards and the announcement/response to spells. 


Shiels had the play in Game One and his four-colour morph deck ("I side into the fifth colour against Aggro decks.") did exactly what they are supposed to do in Khans block limited. He played a bunch of lands that came into play tapped and gave him access to lots of colours. He played a morph on turn three, another on turn four and Higgs was already playing catch-up. 



 The kid from Northern Ontario dug for business with [Bitter Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Revelation) and binned some big monsters, including an [Avalanche Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Tusker). He didn't play his first blocker until turn five when a Hidden Game entered the fray.
