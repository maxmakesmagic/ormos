**What is the most underrated card in the format?**

*Marijn Lybaert: [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay). It's a 2-mana removal that also takes care of all the cards that the black devotion deck has problems with. It kills [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections), [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere), [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade) and it's even good against bestow creatures like [Herald of Torment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Torment).*

*Alessandro Portaro: [Nyx Fleece Ram](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyx+Fleece+Ram). In the match ups where it is good, it wins games by itself.*

*Tomoharu Saito: [Mana Confluence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Confluence) and [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos). Both very powerful.*

*Lee Shi Tian: [Hall of Triumph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hall+of+Triumph)*

*Patrick Dickmann: I really wonder why more people aren't playing [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix).*
