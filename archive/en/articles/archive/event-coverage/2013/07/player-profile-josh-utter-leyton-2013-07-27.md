Ladies and gentlemen, your 2013 Player of the Year, Josh Utter-Leyton.


Utter-Leyton's possession of the title wasn't set until late into the closing rounds of Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze*, nervously watching as Tom Martell made his push for Top 8, but falling narrowly short. With the weight of the world off his shoulders, Utter-Leyton began to gush, incredulous that he was the new Player of the Year.


Having described his time in last year's Players Championship as "the greatest tournament experience he's ever had," Utter-Leyton was ecstatic at the opportunity to give a repeat performance. Earning his spot last year by virtue of his position as one of the top ranked players in the world, Utter-Leyton's calling card has been his utter consistency, seemingly never posting a finish outside of the Top 64. A core member of Team ChannelFireball, Utter-Leyton is surrounded by some of the best minds the game has to offer, and admits that it has been a major factor in his improvement as a player.


Another fairly quiet player once in the game, Utter-Leyton can always be located thanks to his signature headphones and cool demeanor. He can go from stoic to effusive in an instant. Despite being relatively taciturn, when Utter-Leyton speaks, people listen. This is why his articles are some of the most well-received of all of those posted on channelfireball.com.
