Making Your Mana Base
=====================

 When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he dreamt of a job making Magic cards—and now as a Magic designer, he's living his dream! Gavin has been writing about Magic since 2005. 





One of the most important, yet often unsung, aspects of deck building is your mana base. 

 While your creatures and spells are the flashy pieces that will propel you toward victory, your three-color control deck probably wouldn't be able to win too many games if the only lands you could draw were Plains. Competitive **Magic** is commonly a game of small edges, and putting that little bit of extra effort into your mana base can be the difference between going 6–2 at your local PTQ and winning the extra game necessary to clinch that Top 8 slot. 

Writing an article on building mana bases has been a popular request ever since I began writing this column, and today is finally the time to cover the steps that go into making a solid one. This is a topic that can be applied to nearly every deck you ever make.

Ready? Here we go!

**Step 1: Size Up Real Estate**

The first thing I always do, before even figuring out which lands I'm going to be looking at, is figure out about how many lands I'm going to want to play. This way, when I'm adding lands, I know how many I have left.

 For example, if you're building a three-color aggressive deck with twenty lands and the first thing you do is add in twelve [Temples](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;format=+[%22Theros+Block%22]amp;type=+[%22Land%22]amp;name=+[Temple]), it's good to know that you only have eight more land slots left—you're probably going to want to have the rest of your lands come into play untapped.
