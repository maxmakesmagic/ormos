 Diego is a visual designer and longtime Magic addict. He started from scratch creating infographics on VisualizingMagic.com, and he thinks a great game deserves a great communication tool! 






*Kaladesh* is now available and, most importantly, draftable! Diego Fumagalli has put together five examples of some of the cool, fun things you can do in *Kaladesh* Limited when the pieces come together.

*Kaladesh* is full of wonder, invention, and comes-into-play abilities. Those abilities—like energy creation or fabricate—get even better when you can “blink” a creature with Acrobatic Maneuvers (as in, remove it from play and immediately return it). Return those creatures to your hand can be just as effective sometimes.

There are a lot of cool things you can do in *Kaladesh*, including assembling this module set and watching your not-quite-perpetual machine go off. Collect them all!

Vehicles are risky propositions—they need a pilot or they often don’t do anything. That is, unless you have an Ovalchase Daredevil around, always ready to come back for more. And with 4 power, it can crew almost anything. (*Editor's Note: You cannot attack with the vehicle the turn it comes into play. You have to wait a turn.)*

Era of Innovation is a cool card that can give you a few energy here and there—or a lot of energy all at once. Load up on Thopters and an Artificer all in one card and watch the energy roll in.

Incendiary Sabotage is a powerful card, but it requires a sacrifice. Maybe get a little assistance from some artifacts that *want* to be sacrificed.
