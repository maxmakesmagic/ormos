Last weekend was a big one for Constructed fans, as Grand Prix Memphis highlighted North America's first post-*Fate Reforged* Standard format while Grand Prix Vancouver featured the Modern follow-up to Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*. With these weekends came a ton of decks, which you can find below. The Wizards coverage team scouted through the top tables to bring you one of the top performers of each archetype in both of these widely diverse formats, so enjoy!



Meanwhile, the Pro Tour Qualifier season has wrapped up for [Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-tour-dragons-tarkir-event-information). Congratulations to the winners, and we'll see you in Brussels, Belgium, in April!



The Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier (PPTQ) round feeding into Pro Tour *Magic Origins* has also reached its conclusion. [The Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/rptqvan15) (RPTQs) that the winners of the Preliminaries are invited to compete in take place April 25. The format is Standard, so if you won a PPTQ, do your homework on the current Standard format so that when *Dragons of Tarkir* comes out, you'll be prepared to adjust the archetypes and be ready for action in April!


Now that we are switching to the new format for Pro Tour Qualifiers, this will be the final installment of Decks of the Week. Grand Prix decklists will now appear in Wednesday's Organized Play column, and *Magic Online* decklists will still be available [in their usual place](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/products/magiconline/decklists).
