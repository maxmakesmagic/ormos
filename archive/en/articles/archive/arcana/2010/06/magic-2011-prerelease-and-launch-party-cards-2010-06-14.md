And while we're on the subject, the [Launch Parties](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases) is the next weekend, Friday, July 16 through Sunday, July 18. So you probably know where this is going. Especially since you can already see the card just below this paragraph. In fact, there's a better than even chance you looked at the cards before even reading this. So here's the Launch Party card. Enjoy!
