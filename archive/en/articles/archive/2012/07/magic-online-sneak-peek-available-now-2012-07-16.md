As [announced last week](/en/articles/archive/meet-new-magic-online-2012-07-12), the new **Magic Online** starts its limited time Sneak Peek today! You can [download the new game client](/en/articles/archive/download-magic-online-2012-07-12) right now and get started.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature203_55f2nvtyis.jpg)The new **Magic Online** features many improvements, including an updated collection page, improved game play, better graphics, and more. More improvements are on the way as we continue to work towards our Wide Beta later this year, but we wanted our players to check out our progress on the new **Magic Online** for themselves.


Whatâ€™s your favorite new feature? What features can be improved? What other features do you still want? All of your feedback is important, so after playing on the new version, please share your thoughts using this [brief survey](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/977005/Magic-Online-New-UI-Sneak-Peek-Survey) and help shape the future of **Magic Online**. You can also join the conversation in [the **Magic Online** forums](http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/view/75846/135046/Magic_Online_General).


The Sneak Peek will be available until the downtime on July 25, so check it out now and tell us what you think! Please remember actions players perform during the Sneak Peek will affect your actual **Magic Online** accounts. The interface may be different, but the effects are still permanent as if you were using the current MTGO client, so don't get crazy and start trading all your [Helvault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helvault)s for [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves).
