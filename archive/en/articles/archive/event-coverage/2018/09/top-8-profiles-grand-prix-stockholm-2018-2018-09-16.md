**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Past in Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames). It's basically [Yawgmoth's Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Will) with flashback.

[Pieces of the Puzzle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pieces+of+the+Puzzle). It allowed me to kill people on turn four through graveyard hate multiple times.

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


Probably [Collected Company](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) because you sometimes get really good hits and can quickly pull ahead.

[Stony Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stony+Silence) or [Stony Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stony+Silence). It's close but they are really good in the current metagame.
