I often talk about all the work that the current [R&D](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-52) is doing. It's important though to remember that much of the progress we've made has come from building on the work of those who came before us. Too often the focus is on the present and not on the past. Many many people are responsible for making **Magic** what it is today.
