### WIZARDS OF THE COAST TO OPEN ART VAULTS TO PUBLIC FOR FIRST TIME

### Publisher of Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering Will Release Ten Iconic Art Pieces in Historic First

**JULY 29, 2005 (Renton, Wash.)** - The eyes of the art world will be on Seattle this fall as a portion of one of the largest privately held collections of fantasy-themed art in existence is made available to the public for the first time in a Limited Edition art collection. Wizards of the Coast, a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc. (NYSE: HAS) and publisher of the famed **MAGIC: THE GATHERING** Trading Card Game (TCG) and **DUNGEONS & DRAGONS** roleplaying game (RPG), announced today that it will sell Limited Edition art pieces from its expansive archives in the fall of 2005. 

 The acclaimed work of some of the world's top fantasy artists has long been available for public enjoyment in the form of 2 1/2 x 3 1/2 inch trading cards and as ancillary illustrations in game manuals. The debut of Limited Edition Collection will now provide a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for connoisseurs of fantasy art to acquire several of the most celebrated pieces in full-size, collection quality format. 

 "For over thirty years the fantastical, otherworldly art of **DUNGEONS & DRAGONS** and **MAGIC: THE GATHERING** has inspired the creative energies of millions," said Laura Tommervik, Brand Manager for the Limited Edition Collection at Wizards of the Coast. "Our archives are filled with more than 15,000 pieces of completely original, fantasy art commissioned for our games and novel lines during the last three decades. This limited sale of ten iconic pieces is a first of its kind for Wizards." 

Ten select pieces of **MAGIC: THE GATHERING** and **DUNGEONS & DRAGONS** art will go on sale in early fall of 2005 with 250 artist signed and numbered canvases and 1,000 artist signed and numbered prints for each selection. Available exclusively via online sale through wizards.com, prices will range from approximately fifty to three hundred dollars each.
