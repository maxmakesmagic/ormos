Are you going to be at [Gen Con](http://www.gencon.com/2012/indy/default.aspx)? Maybe I'll see you there! And maybe you'd like to know about some of the **Magic** things on the schedule.


In fact, there's going to be **Magic** all weekend long. Just as you'd expect at the Best Four Days in Gaming, right? The [full schedule is here](http://www.pastimes.net/events/convention/gencon-2012/%20), and it's full of Limited and Constructed events of all varieties. Prizes include packs, uncut **Magic** sheets, foil sets, and more. And thirty-two events feed Sunday's **[Gen Con Championship](http://www.pastimes.net/events/1373/)**, a single-elimination draft showdown with big prizes.
