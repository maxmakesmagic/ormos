As has become tradition over the past few sets, I like to highlight the very cool peek at how the premium foil cards are produced by highlighting the layer which gives them their reflectiveness.


I posted on Twitter asking for a few ideas as to what to show you and got a slew of responses, I've taken some of them and here they are!


First up: [Heliod, God of the Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%2C+God+of+the+Sun). The #1 request was to see how the Nyx-ified border looked, so here is our first (but not only) example.

Next up is one of my favorite cards in *Theros* because, who doesn't love bacon? [Curse of the Swine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+the+Swine).

Now, this one is a Commander and I just love the flavor of a returned king commanding in the afterlife. Check out [Tymaret, the Murder King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tymaret%2C+the+Murder+King):

And then we come to the next god we're looking at, [Erebos, God of the Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead).

I also wanted to show what an Nyx-ified Artifact looked like, so here is the [Hammer of Purphoros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammer+of+Purphoros).

And then here is [Artisan's Sorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artisan%27s+Sorrow) which jumped out to me because this entire goblet shines beautifully. Here's why!

And I don't think we can get away with doing this arcana without looking at [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx). I think this underlayer just simply shows how subtle a beautiful foil can be.
