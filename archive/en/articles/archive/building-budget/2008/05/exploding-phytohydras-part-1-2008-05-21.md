Hello everybody, and welcome back to Building on a Budget, the **magicthegathering.com** column dedicated to building decks that cost 30 tickets or less using **Magic Online**! A few weeks ago, I ran [an article](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/boab-unplugged-twenty-older-gems-2008-04-30) highlighting twenty underused gems from older sets. You voted, and here were the top three finishers:




| **Which of these ideas do you most want to see a deck built around?** |
| --- |
| Sprouting Phytohydra | 821 | 12.1% |
| Zur's Weirding | 734 | 10.8% |
| Braids, Cabal Minion | 586 | 8.6% |

[Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) won with over 12% of the votes cast... but that doesn't tell the whole story! Around *half* of the forum posts and e-mails I received that week were regarding a [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) / [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aether%2BFlash) deck! Truly I had struck gold here, and the people wanted to see how to build a [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) deck... on a budget!


Fair enough, my poppets! But to build a [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) deck, one must first truly become one with the [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra). And to do that, we will scrutinize the most miniscule aspects of its vascular structure. From top to bottom:


**Fact #1: [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) Costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) to play.**


Why does this matter? [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) is not the cheapest combo piece ever printed. In fact, it is likely to be the highest-mana cost card in its own deck! This means that other cards that work with the [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra) need to be set up before we're ready to play it—cards such as [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aether%2BFlash) and [Pyrohemia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrohemia) (both conveniently at four mana), or [Essence Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden) / [Soul Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden) (both at one mana). Also, [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) only takes a single green mana to play. There are a lot of red-intensive cards (and, possibly, white-intensive cards) that work well in a [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) deck, so it is not out of the question to build this deck with [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) as the only included green card.


 



![Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sprouting+Phytohydra)

**Fact #2:** **[Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) is creature type "Plant Hydra."**
There aren't many cards that specifically work with either Plants or Hydras, but it is important to note the types, in case we want to go nuts with [Conspiracy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conspiracy) (to allow us to access [Boggart Shenanigans](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Shenanigans)) or with [Coat of Arms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coat+of+Arms) (so that each [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra) gives other [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra)s +1/+1).


**Fact #3: [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) has defender.**


Any win that comes from this deck either has to come through a third card: [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) plus [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aether%2BFlash) may make an arbitrarily large number of [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra)s into play (and into the graveyard), but that in and of itself won't kill an opponent. Even if you boost the toughness of the [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra) ([Gaea's Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Anthem)?), it still can't attack – so you'd need to make it lose defender ([Wakestone Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wakestone+Gargoyle)) or find something else to do with those plants ([Soulblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulblast)).


**Fact #4:** **"Whenever [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) is dealt damage, you may put a token into play that's a copy of [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra)."**


Here's the meat of the deal. Any method of dealing damage to the [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) will create another [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra). That copy will also make copies, just like the original—doesn't matter if the original is still in play or not. Lethal damage will still cause a copy to be made. The amount of damage done is irrelevant; one damage or one million damage (as long as it is dealt all at once) will cause the [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra) to trigger. Token creatures briefly visit the graveyard and then are removed from the game, so copies of the token that die will trigger (or count towards) effects that care about creatures going to the graveyard, such as [Bitter Ordeal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Ordeal). Reducing the toughness of a [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra) to 0 will not make a copy, so an effect like [Nameless Inversion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Inversion) will kill the [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra) outright, as will 'destroy' effects like [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) or [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). The ability to make a copy of [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) is optional (note the word may), so you can stop a loop with [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aether%2BFlash) whenever you wish (allowing you to attack / play sorceries afterwards, etc).


**Fact #5: [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) is a 0/2 creature.**


A [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) is not the sturdiest creature, nor does it have a natural power above zero. Even if you can make them attack, or keep them alive, they still will deal 0 damage on the attack. You need something to boost power (say, [Leyline of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Meek)) to get the creature at (or above) one power.


Each of these different aspects of the card is important to take into consideration when making deck choices—how do you want the deck to win, which colors are best suited for the deck, and what happens if you don't get your combo going? Thankfully, you (the reader!) gave a lot of great suggestions on cards to use with [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra). Let's assume for a second that our goal is to make an arbitrarily large number of [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra)s with [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aether%2BFlash). What next?


 



![Auriok Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Auriok+Champion)

**Goal Number One: Gain Infinite Life!**
What better way to take advantage of infinite creatures coming into play than by gaining infinite life? Combine the [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) / [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aether%2BFlash) loop with either [Essence Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden), [Soul Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden), or (my favorite) [Auriok Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Champion) (which can survive [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aether%2BFlash)) to send your life total into the stratosphere!


The alternate method is with little-used *Coldsnap* rare [Tamanoa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamanoa), or little-used *Dissension* rare [Proper Burial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Proper+Burial). The Warden loop involves creatures coming into play. [Tamanoa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamanoa) relies on damage being dealt to Audrey II, and [Proper Burial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Proper+Burial) relies on Seymour sending her to her final resting place. Having a [Test of Endurance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Test+of+Endurance) to finish your opponent off works best for any of these methods.


**Goal Number Two: Make Another Creature Infinitely Large**


Maybe [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) has defender, but other creatures do not! [Herd Gnarr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herd+Gnarr), [Juniper Order Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juniper+Order+Ranger), and [Twilight Drover](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Drover) are just three creatures that can benefit from a party of coming and going [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra)s! Once you've pumped your guys suitably high enough to attack, go in for a one-turn kill in the red zone, or make a ton of 1/1 flying spirits with the Drover. Bonus to [Juniper Order Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juniper+Order+Ranger) to working as a way to make your [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra)s 1/3, in case you want to combine with Goal Number Three!


**Goal Number Three: Amass an Army!**


Find a way to pump up the power and/or toughness of [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra)! [Leyline of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Meek), [Juniper Order Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juniper+Order+Ranger), [Primal Forcemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Forcemage), and [Gaea's Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Anthem) are just three of the easy ways to make your [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra) survive [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aether%2BFlash). Once you've got an army of [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra)s, what can you do? Shoot your opponent with a ton of [Blasting Station](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasting+Station) activations. [Soulblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulblast) your entire board for 1,000,000+ damage! Sit behind your [Epic Struggle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Epic+Struggle) and win with an entire garden full of creatures. The sky is the limit! Throw in [Wakestone Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wakestone+Gargoyle) so your [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra)s can grow legs and walk to the Red Zone en mass!


**Goal Number Four: Draw your Entire Deck!**


Johnny favorite [Fecundity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fecundity) is the key here; as each [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra) dies, you get to draw another card out of your deck. Since you can stop this loop whenever you want, you are more than welcome to end up with a grip of 40+ cards—and trust me, as long as you pack some mana acceleration ([Simian Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide), [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame), etc), you will inevitably have the same endgame scenario (40+ cards in hand) every game, as long as the combo goes off. Figure out what do to do with a ton of endgame red mana (4 [Simian Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide) + 4 [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame) + 4 [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) = 22 mana (4 mana from Spirit Guides + 10 net mana from [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame)s + 8 net mana from [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song)s)—enough for a single [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) and 21 damage to the head—and that's just using no imagination!).


 



![Goblin Sharpshooter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Sharpshooter)

**Goal Number Five: Trigger your Inner Goblin!**
[Goblin Sharpshooter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sharpshooter) plus infinite dead [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra)s equals infinite shooting power from everyone's favorite gattling-gun-wielding green man. That's [Goblin Sharpshooter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sharpshooter)—though the same combo works with the above-mentioned [Blasting Station](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasting+Station), as long as you've got a toughness booster (because you need it to take damage from the [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aether%2BFlash) in order to make a copy, and unless you boost toughness, the Flash will kill your plant before you get to chuck it into the [Blasting Station](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasting+Station)).


**Goal Number Six: Deck your Opponent!**


What do you do when infinite creatures have gone to the graveyard in one turn? Why, you play [Bitter Ordeal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Ordeal), and remove your opponent's entire deck from the game! At least we haven't thrown any blue cards into the mix for this deck at all, have we?


Also, a special shout-out goes to [Pyrohemia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrohemia), which will continually trigger multiple [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra)s with each activation. If you've got one [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra), the first [Pyrohemia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrohemia) activation will leave you with two [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra)s. The second will leave you with three (first dies, second lives, both make copies). The third will leave you with five (second dies, third and fourth live, all three make copies) and so on and so forth. This is a good alternate way to make a huge number of plants if you don't have [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aether%2BFlash) already on the board, and another argument for including [Auriok Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Champion).


So, now we both understand the anatomy of the [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra), and we've figured out six distinct ways to win with it—but as they say on *South Park*, Step 1: Steal Underpants, Step 2: ???, Step 3: Profit! That's where we throw in a bit of methodology:


 



![Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Llanowar+Elves)

**Method One: Acceleration!**
You're playing red and you're playing green—both are the colors of mana acceleration! Between [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Wild Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Growth), [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame), [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) (ok, technically colorless), and other mana speeder-uppers, you can go from one to five mana within three turns. This gambit would play for speed by trying to land the combo as quickly as possible, before the opponent has time to either kill you or find answers to your combo.


**Method Two: Method Acting!**


Why make the [Sprouting Phytohydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sprouting%2BPhytohydra) / [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aether%2BFlash) combo the center of your deck? There are plenty of great cards in green, red, white and black that work well enough on their own. [Pyrohemia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrohemia) is great creature removal, and [Essence Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden) has frustrated many an opponent. Play with the combo in your deck, but don't focus all of your energies on getting it. If you draw it, you draw it, and if not, you still have ways to win.


**Method Three: Proactive Hand Removal!**


The tried and true black method: strip out your opponent's hand to make sure that they can't react to any of your moves. [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Distress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress), [Castigate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castigate)—all of these are valid cards to make sure that you can lay down your combo without having to fear countermagic / [Disenchant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant) / the stray piece of creature removal designed to keep you from making your arbitrarily large garden grow!


**Method Four: Lots of Tutors!**


White and green are especially good colors for tutoring up, respectively, enchantments and creatures. Use [Idyllic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Idyllic+Tutor) or [Lost Auramancers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lost+Auramancers) to fetch [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aether%2BFlash), or [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) to put [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) straight into your hand. This method has redundancy. Iinstead of only having four copies of each card in your deck, you get eight to twelve copies, depending on the number of tutors you run.


So, we've got a list of five facts, six goals, and four methods as potentials for this [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) build, revolving around four different colors—meaning that, if we focused on one of each of the six-by-four-by-six matrix, we'd end up with a total of 120 vastly different-looking [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) decks, and that's not counting builds that overlap one another. Some of these methods might have more merit than others, especially in particular matchups; a proactive discard strategy is great against a control deck, but not as good against a green-white beatdown deck, and vise-versa. In order to best figure out where we need to start the actual build and testing of this deck next week, we need polls! Lots and lots of polls!


See you all in seven days as we take the poll results and formulate the reader's choice for the Building on a Budget [Sprouting Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Phytohydra) deck, complete with playtesting! See you in seven!
