Yesterday, the @[dailymtg](/en/articles/archive/2012-07-10) Twitter feed showed three pieces of *Zendikar* equipment. And today, we're going to take a closer look at one of them. Here's the card.

That's a pair of boots, all right. Here's the art description that got us here.



> 'Color: Artifact  
> Location: Any outdoor  
> Action: Show a pair of rugged, leather hiking boots crisscrossed with straps and bindings and plated in places with weathered metal. These are essential gear for adventurers and travelers. Perhaps we see streaks of mud and turf stuck to them from clearly distinct terrains.  
> Focus: The boots  
> Mood: They'll take you anywhere in the world.Notes: Be careful of anachronism. These are well-made, but still fantasy boots -- no rubber treads, etc.

The treads on the boots are, in fact, not rubber. They're actually rune-inscribed plates that have been nailed to the bottom to provide magical traction! And here, of course, is a better look at this great piece by Zoltan Boros & Gabor Szikszai.
