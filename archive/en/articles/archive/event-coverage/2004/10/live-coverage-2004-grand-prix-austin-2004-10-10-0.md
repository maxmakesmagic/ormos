![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpaus04/day1.jpg)Day one has come to a close and the three names atop the standings have the tell-tale asterisk of amateur status. The only pristine records after eight rounds of play belonged to Chris Prochak and Jacob Sklar--check back in the morning for their decklists. They took out a couple of the game's rising stars in the final round in Gerry Thompson and Mitch Tamblyn. Gerry and Mitch will have a chance to avenge themselves in the first pod of tomorrow's Rochester draft action.


Dan Burdick and Jim Finstrom have nearly perfect records at 7-0-1. Kate Stavola followed up on her Top 8 performance from last season's Grand Prix Columbus with another strong showing today. Brockerfeller namesake Brock Parker rounded out the first pod which will be under the spotlight come Sunday.


Check back in the morning for undefeated deck lists and Rochester Draft coverage as we continue to unravel the mysteries of Champions of Kamigawa and give away $25,000 along the way.
