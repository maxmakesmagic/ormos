Turn Over


Strangling grasp received a minor wording update to make it clearer that the player that sacrifices a permanent will still lose 1 life even if the permanent they sacrificed was the enchanted permanent.


**Strangling Grasp was**:


Enchant creature or planeswalker an opponent controls  

At the beginning of your upkeep, enchanted permanent's controller sacrifices a nonland permanent and loses 1 life.


**New text**:


Enchant creature or planeswalker an opponent controls  

At the beginning of your upkeep, enchanted permanent's controller sacrifices a nonland permanent, then that player loses 1 life.
