While many online games would consider it a success to see their twentieth month, *Magic: The Gathering Online* wraps up its twentieth year on June 24! We want to celebrate this milestone with our players this June, including awarding one of the coolest—and biggest—single prizes in *Magic Online* history!


There's a lot on deck: the *[Vintage Cube](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist)* has returned and will run until June 30, the $70,000 [Champions Showcase](#showcase) airs on June 18, and the All-Access Mythic Event Token is back in the *Magic Online* store—which could be just the thing to help some talented mage out there win a playset of nearly every booster release on *Magic Online*\* in the [20th Anniversary Series](#20th)!


You don't need great *Magic* talent or a Mythic Event Token to come away with something, though. Every account created before June 7 will receive 100 Play Points during the celebration! That's a free *Vintage Cube* Draft or Constructed League, or simply 100 Play Points toward whatever you want to do! Also, these accounts will receive a 20th Anniversary Avatar based on the age of the account after the celebration is over:


* Up to one year: Bear Cub
* Up to five years: Young Pyromancer
* Up to ten years: Eager Cadet
* Up to fifteen years: Veteran Adventurer
* Up to twenty years: Transcendent Master

From the Bear Cubs to the Transcendent Masters, we thank you for playing *Magic Online* and hope you'll join us for the festivities!


20th Anniversary Series
=======================


What's this about a near playset of *Magic Online*? It's true! The winner of the *Magic Online* 20th Anniversary Series will add to their *Magic Online* collection four complete sets of almost every booster release\* in the history of *Magic Online*! Players that finish 4–1 or 5–0 in both a Limited and a Constructed Play-In Event between June 9 and June 24 qualify for the finals on Saturday, June 25, at 7 a.m. Pacific.


The finals event is *Modern Horizons 2* Limited (Sealed with Top 8 Draft). The Play-In format rotates every two days and includes a Limited lineup of *Masters 25*, *Vintage Masters*, *Modern Horizons*, and *Modern Horizons 2*, and Constructed events for Legacy, Vintage, Modern, and Pioneer. Play-In Events fire every 4 hours at 1 a.m., 5 a.m., and 9 a.m. and 1 p.m., 5 p.m., and 9 p.m. Pacific time.


Full event details can be found [below](#details)!


All-Access Mythic Event Token
=============================


What if you wanted to play in each of the 20th Anniversary Series events, but your collection is a Mox or five short of your dream Vintage deck? Perhaps you've been eyeing the four Showcase Challenges in June that lead to the Champions Showcase, but you're only happy with your Pauper deck. Maybe you just want to try out some quirky Commander brews, but you don't have a deep collection. Good news, All-Access Weeks are back! From June 8–25, the Mythic Event Token will be available in the *Magic Online* Store, allowing players to use almost every card on *Magic Online* during the 20th Anniversary Series.


![Mythic 20th Anniversary All-Access Event Token](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/20th%20Anniversary%20All-Access%20Event%20Token%20-%20Drop%20Shadow.png)


To use the Mythic Event Token, simply purchase it in the *Magic Online* store and enter a game or event. No cards will be added to your collection, but you'll be able to play with any legal deck in the format, even if you don't have all the cards in your collection. In fact, you don't need any!


The token is $25.00 USD, and the access will last until downtime on June 29. We'll remove all the Mythic Event Tokens from accounts and turn off All-Access during that downtime.


*\*Note: Just like previous All-Access periods, certain cards (*Secret Lair *versions,* Battlebond*, and old-frame Power Nine) are unavailable.*


2022 *Magic Online* Champions Showcase
======================================

The [2022 *Magic Online* Champions Showcase Season 1 event](https://magic.gg/events/2022-magic-online-champions-showcase-season-1) airs on [*Magic*'s Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) on June 18 starting at 10 a.m. Pacific (17:00 UTC). Tune in and watch eight of *Magic Online*'s best battle in *Vintage Cube* and Modern for their share of a $70,000 prize pool! Look for a Viewer's Guide article next week on [Magic.gg](https://www.magic.gg/).


Want to play in a future Champions Showcase yourself? There are four Showcase Challenge tournaments in June during the availability window of the [All-Access Mythic Event Token](#token). Each event costs 40 Qualifier Points to enter, and the Top 8 move a step closer to Season 2's Showcase. Pick up the Mythic Event Token, and you won't need a collection to compete in these Showcase Challenge events with the decks of your choice!


*Magic Online*'s Premier Play information can be [found here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/2022-magic-online-premier-play-program). *(Note: The Pauper event scheduled for June 25 has been moved to June 18.)*


A Lovely Vintage
================


Finally, what better way to celebrate this storied digital game than by drafting and playing with some of the most powerful cards of all time in *Magic Online*'s *Vintage Cube*?

Time Warp
=========


It's hard to believe it has been 20 years since the launch of *Magic Online*! This game—in its constant state of development, with its tens of thousands of unique cards interacting on battlefields across an unmatched spectrum of *Magic* formats—is an incredible accomplishment. It took a massive leap of faith to build *Magic Online* in the first place, and it has taken a massive labor of love to grow and sustain it for 20 years since. While the individuals on the *Magic Online* team have changed over the decades, a deep passion for the game has been a universal characteristic of the *Magic Online* team at every point in its history.


Of course, all those passionate teams have only been able to continue building this majestic beast thanks to the equally passionate *Magic Online* players who have supported it over the years. So, no matter when you climbed on board, we are incredibly grateful you've joined us on the *Magic Online* journey—thank you.


Happy 20th Anniversary, *Magic Onlin*e!
