 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






 While Gatecrash previews firing from the get-go next week will push out my follow up significantly, the  [Compendium of Casual **Magic**](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/features.aspx?tag=compendium%20of%20casual%20magic) is something I'm still working on. Whether it's a clever and small rules change or a fundamentally upended game experience, my first pass through the years of Serious Fun reveal a rich diversity of ways to play. 


If Commander or Draft aren't your thing, but Standard and Modern aren't either, I guarantee you'll find something different here. At the very least, you'll have a few things to try while you wait for next week.


  
  

Over time, everything changes. 

While I shared some personal changes during Transformation Week, and hinted at ongoing evolution that had been fruitful during the second Feedback Week, there's a much larger issue hidden in any consideration of "Where are we now?"

Where did we come from?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf176_time.jpg)  
 Yesterday, Mark Rosewater shared some of the history of **MagicTheGathering.com**, which hit its ten-year anniversary. I've been here just over a fifth of that time, but Serious Fun was one of the progenitor columns. Throughout the past *decade*, Serious Fun has been sharing **Magic** through a lens of multiple players, off-beat cards, and even more diverse ways to play. 

But that's not what today's about. Today is for the decade of history that is hidden away within the walls of text that Anthony Alongi, The Ferrett, Kelly Digges, and I have all provided. What do I mean by "wall" of text? It's a simple mathematical problem to solve.


> 
> * 50 articles each year
> * 2,000 words (a guesstimated average number in each article)
> * 10 years
> 

 These three together yield an estimated *one million words* of Serious Fun, and I suspect it's significantly more than that. 

 No wonder so many of you have asked for a breakdown of fun formats featured in the past. Just *finding* them is a needle-in-a-haystack problem. Of course, many of you also had no qualm about asking *me* to go find them all. (You're welcome.) 

I promised to do that. Today I deliver on that promise. We have here an organized breakdown of casual formats from across the archive of Serious Fun. Today is just the first three years, all of which were under the fine wordsmanship of Anthony Alongi.

 And one final important note: I did *not* begin running through the Feature Article archive, which also introduced many new ways to play. Once Serious Fun's archive has been exhausted, expect a rundown of the Feature Articles as well. (You're welcome, again.) 

 Now, for your gaming pleasure, here is the first part of a Serious Fun Compendium of Casual **Magic**. 

### Limited Formats

 I love Limited—Draft, Sealed, and other pack-busting causes—and many of you do, too. Anthony felt strongly that Limited was one of the best ways to play **Magic**, and his passion led him to share some interesting ways to play with packs. 



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Format | Players | Summary  |
| [Booster Draft](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/you-bust-those-packs-2003-08-05) | 8 | A recap of the essentials and benefits of basic Booster Draft.  |
| [Pack Reconstruction](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/unlimited-limited-2003-08-19) | 2+ | Use existing cards to generate custom boosters, then used as per normal. (Ancestor to Cube Draft.)  |
| [Pack Wars](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/you-bust-those-packs-2003-08-05) | 2+ | A two-player draft format using just two packs of cards. (The same result as modern Pack Wars.)  |
| [Sealed](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/you-bust-those-packs-2003-08-05) | 2+ | A recap of the essentials and benefits of Sealed.  |
| [Backdraft](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/limiting-your-bad-format-2002-07-02) | 8 | Intentionally draft the worst possible pile of cards for deck construction, then assign pools to players randomly.  |
| [Backdraft](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/you-bust-those-packs-2003-08-05) | 8 | A recap of the Anthony-original Backdraft format.  |
| [Emperor Draft](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/drafting-emperor-style-2004-02-10) | 6+ | An update to the usual constructed approach that pairs team-based fun with Draft.  |
| [Family of Four](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/goldfish-no-more-2004-07-12) | 4 | Modified 4-player draft. Two experienced players helping to coach two inexperienced players. (Two parents, two kids.)  |
| [Mini-Master (Pack Wars)](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/unlimited-limited-2003-08-19) | 2+ | A recap of the single-pack Prerelease staple.  |
| [Rochester Draft](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/you-bust-those-packs-2003-08-05) | 8 | An introduction to Rochester Draft, where all packs and picks are made face-up.  |
| [Rotisserie Draft](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/unlimited-limited-2003-08-19) | 8 |  An entire set of **Magic** is gathered to be drafted, face-up (a la Rochester).  |
| [Solomon Draft](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/unlimited-limited-2003-08-19) | 2 | A three-pack Booster Draft where each pack is divided into two piles, one player choosing a pile and leaving the remaining for the other.  |
| [Team Rochester](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/you-bust-those-packs-2003-08-05) | 8 | An introduction to team-based Limited, with Rochester Draft.  |
| [Team Sealed](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/you-bust-those-packs-2003-08-05) | 2+ | An introduction to team-based Limited, with Sealed.  |
| [Two-on-Two Draft](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/you-bust-those-packs-2003-08-05) | 4+ | An abridged, team-based Draft format for even numbers, started at 4. |

  
The formats Anthony hit first include former high-level formats (such as the highly skillful Rochester Draft) as well as some much more accessible formats (basic Sealed and Booster Draft are unforgettable as they are). They cover the most basic of booster-pack cracking up through complex amalgams of constructed and collecting.

Two real gems hidden away were Anthony's Family of Four and Two-on-Two formats. While my default for four players is, essentially, multiplayer drafting, these two work for the more commonly encountered situations of small groups or new players.

Family of Four is Limited coaching. You provide hints and tips through pack organization, but still allow the drafter to choose the picks. Similar to attempting to send signals in a draft, just because cards are organized or presented in such a way doesn't mean that's exactly what will happen. It's a fair balance between assisting and instructing: giving them the ultimate choice matters. No one likes to be told what to do, but a few hints are often a welcome signpost.

 Two-on-Two is another small-group Limited format, but this one is meant to make the games faster. Instead of setting up a series of duels round-robin style, jumping into teams sets up just one big game. Team multiplayer is a beautiful thing; I plan to give this a formal reintroduction and demonstration sometime after *Dark Ascension*! 

And, for trivia buffs, you'll notice that Pack Wars appeared as a single-booster Draft variant, while Mini-Master proudly stood for our modern take on Pack Wars. "Pack Reconstruction" serves as a Leibniz to our modern Newtonian Cube format. And Backdraft, while dripping with the griefer feel that's quite polarizing, is an easy inversion to understand, and an even more hilarious way to see new things at work in a set.

### Constructed Formats

 Anthony created a variety of interesting formats, many of which predicated on the idea of changing or creating a specific rule for **Magic**. We'll get to many of those in the next section, but this breakdown covered the more ambitious and creative ways to float some fun. 



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |

| [Sorry](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/re-glued-2004-08-17) | 2+ | Sorry sits out as a global enchantment. (No, you can't get rid of it in any way.)  |
| [Spirit Deck](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/few-favorite-things-2004-12-07) | 2+ | A spirit Tribal deck. It's seasonal!  |
| [The Adaptable Servitor](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/your-service-2004-06-08) | 3+ | Combine Contagious Servitor with Well-Heeled Servitor for even more fun.  |
| [The Contagious Servitor](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/your-service-2004-06-08) | 3+ |  Every creatures has the [Myr Servitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Servitor) ability, and everything else counts as a Servitor.  |
| [The Crowded Servitor](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/your-service-2004-06-08) | 3+ |  Everyone adds a deck with four [Myr Servitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Servitor)s, then plays with one big shared library.  |
| [The Servitor Incarnate](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/your-service-2004-06-08) | 3+ |  Players rebuy into the game, similar to Respawn **Magic**.  |
| [The Well-Heeled Servitor](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/your-service-2004-06-08) | 2+ |  Decks must contain four copies of [Myr Servitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Servitor).  |
| [Vengeful Servitor](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/your-service-2004-06-08) | 3+ | [Myr Servitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Servitor)s gain aggressive, pining abilities.  |
| [Wall of Wonder](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/random-box-formats-2004-11-16) | 2+ | Players may spent mana, anytime, to give target creature +4/-4 until end of turn. Walls will be friends! |

  
 Now *this* is a list of formats. Some of these have not aged well—four formats are based around maximizing the efforts of [Myr Servitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Servitor), for example—but others are tantalizingly fresh. Bad Deck sounds like an adorably good time. Mulligan Points is both instructive (mulligans can be good) and balancing (for those times when your deck just isn't being nice on opening hands). 

One of the most powerful treasures I found was a comprehensive—and strategic—breakdown for creating Theme Decks. I don't mean any sort of previously released preconstructed product, but a clear and effective rationale for going with an overriding theme. I've sometimes struggled to get a theme to click, and Anthony's method not only keeps players like me on track but also encourages good construction of the theme!

### General Formats

 These formats and variants aren't limited to just Limited or Constructed. Anthony spent a lot of effort creating formats from simple implements—words, cards, principles, ideas, themes, and more—that resulted in a quick-fix of fun. Of course, much more complex and layered ways to play percolate throughout as well.

 Okay. I lied. *This*—really, truly, *this* is an amazing list. Those of you who have called for "more funky, more different" ways to play have found a deep vein of gold to tap. If you've been looking to spice up any way **Magic** pops up—Limited or Constructed—then you should take a second, closer look above to see what jumps out at you. I'll share a few of my favorites here. 

 "Mercenaries," or Mercenary **Magic** as I'll call it now on, appeals to the analytical side of me. While I love randomness and the zany happenstance of the multiplayer games I seek, I also like to thoroughly consider **Magic** at a logical level. Anyone who enjoys building multiple, different, unique Commander decks, or has created your own [Cube](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/93), can understand what it's like to look forward to the results of some careful planning up front. 

 Mercenary **Magic** lets players hire a random creature, for its casting cost, from a library of preselected creatures. You don't always know what you're hiring before you see it, and failure to pay comes with very steep penalties. However, like with  [Horde **Magic**](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/down-down-left-right-left-right-b-shuffle-2011-10-18), how and what goes into the Mercenary deck makes a huge difference in the game play it provides. Will you use safe utility creatures, like [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum), or try out huge, messy critters of multiplayer madness, such as [Geth, Lord of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geth%2C+Lord+of+the+Vault)? High costs make the risk significant, but the reward that much more appealing. Letting players buy cheap, helpful creatures can get any game going quicker. (Expect a much bigger dive when I came back to this someday!) 

 Another format that can completely shake how you approach the game is Sliverocity. When everything shares everything, everything is something else. Got a [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) out? Now every creatures taps for mana! Your opponent casts a [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger)? Now the creatures you play fetch up a basic land too. The possibilities for interaction are off the charts, and the dynamics of games wildly shifts. Suddenly, opponents might start protecting your guys to keep benefiting from their abilities! 

 The final format that I found really engaging is Turkey. [*Archenemy*](/en/node/642781) has a similar feel, but this has a very different goal. Randomly determining the Turkey that everyone will go after, and the shift in Turkey when he or she finally falls, presents many more opportunities than you might see at first glance. Do you spend *all* your effort on the Turkey, or do you begin planning ahead to when your number is up? Do you bring your game-breaking deck with huge effects, or a compact and defensive array meant to hold out for the benefits of being targeted? Perhaps the biggest bonus of all is how much faster games will go—there's always one clear and present target, and the impact of political considerations is much smaller! 

### Our Time is Nigh!

 Of course, a few words and dozens of links—more than 60 formats were pointed to above—aren't a complete picture of everything that's fun. This is just a way for everyone, myself included, to start 2012 off on the right foot. I hope you find this as helpful as I know this will be for me down the road. And, of course, suggestions to improve the experience for the next batch of formats is definitely appreciated!

 Next week is the start of *Dark Ascension* previews. If you thought things were bad on Innistrad, a whole new level of awful is descending. See you from the shadows next week!
