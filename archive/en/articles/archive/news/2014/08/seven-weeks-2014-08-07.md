Thank you!



As of this writing, I received more than 700 emails reporting issues on the website. From content issues to critical functionality problems, you all have done a great job helping us identify what needs to be fixed on the new *Magic* site.



While we are excited about many improvements the new site offers, the launch did not go as smoothly as was hoped, and even after it was up we had a number of critical issues around publishing and the archives that have lingered. We've been gathering your feedback and adding it to our own issues list, so we can get site functionality not just back to par with the previous website, but make it even better.



We've been working diligently behind the scenes to improve the site and make it the experience we all want it to be. In fact, we rolled out an update last week, as well as today, with some fixes for issues affecting mobile users, as well as the display of Card of the Day, sample hand size in decks, the navigation on mobile, and the archive dropdowns at the bottom of the Articles tab.



We recognize the website still needs work and we are dedicated to make this website what you all expect us to deliver. Development on a site of this size and complexity is a work in progress, but with future updates, I'll be providing release notes so users can see what we are fixing and working on with the website.



Thank you all for your patience and for continuing to report issues on the site to [newmagicwebsite@wizards.com](mailto:newmagicwebsite@wizards.com).
