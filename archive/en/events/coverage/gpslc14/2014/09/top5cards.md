At the end of premier play with *Magic* 2015, there's an entire history to consider. From its debut at Pro Tour *Magic* 2015 through this weekend at Grand Prix Salt Lake City, we've come to learn a lot about what players can do with three or six packs of the set. These are the top five cards crossing over the successes seen in Sealed and Draft with the set.


  




### 5. [Festergloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festergloom)


Throughout the early days of the *Magic 2015* format, we heard the name "[Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits)" and shudders ran down our spines. Nowadays, even though we still aim to get that sorcery for ourselves, a card emerged as the glowing beacon for non-white drafters everywhere. [Festergloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festergloom) is incredibly powerful against a format full of one-butts, especially a multitude of white-token one-butts.


This card moved quickly from sideboards to main decks. And ever since, every white drafter must worry if they are about to get royally blown out whenever they tap everything on turn four to make those three precious spirits. Even if you've yet to see a Swamp, that doesn't mean one won't show up at the most inopportune time to ruin your token party.


Draft formats are self-correcting by nature, and [Festergloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festergloom) is that correction.






  




### 4. [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward)


Already a known draft bomb thanks to its standout performance at Grand Prix Sydney, both semifinalist 17th-ranked Eric Froehlich and winner Brandon Nelson picked the rare Aura and ran with it. Combined with Heliod's Pilgrim, [Borderland Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Marauder), or, well, nearly any creature you can imagine, the Ward creates a nigh-untargetable, nigh-unblockable attacker enough to cut through even the staunchest of opponents. While it wasn't always pretty, or fair, the Aura dominated the games it was allowed to resolve and typically secured a win for its controller.







  




### 3. [Cone of Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cone+of+Flame)


Even though there are a bevy of mythics and rares that create an immediate, powerful impact on the battlefield, every once in a while, there’s an uncommon that trumps the lot of ‘em. Cone of Flame was consistently among the most back-breaking plays one could make, typically trading one card for three of the opponent’s creatures. It is among the few cards that can pull you back into a Sealed or Draft game that looks otherwise lost, and it obviously puts games away that were formerly close. Opening Cone of Flame in your first pack was among the chief reasons a player forced his or her way into the color through the rest of a draft, and seeing it in your Sealed pool was alone enough to have you sleeve up some Mountains.

### 2. [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros)


Unbeatable. While there are a only a few cards that can answer anything in the mythic Soul cycle, it's [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros) that was most frequently seen at the top tables in Sealed. Functioning as both an [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)-type effect to break stalemates and a way to gain tons of life, it didn't matter if you were ahead or behind when your [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros) appeared: It went to you and you won. In a similar vein, [Soul of Shandalar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Shandalar) was a way to answer most creatures opponents would play and provided combat-free inevitability when needed. Both Souls features highly in the battles to remain undefeated at the end of Day 1.

### 1. [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits)


While mythics, rares, and uncommons may be among the most impactful cards in any format, the bread-and-butter base that the best commons provide is undeniable. [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) is a card that does so many things on so many levels it's hard to qualify. Making three flying Spirit creature tokens is powerful both on offense and defense, and convoke makes it possible to cast this early and often even if you're missing a few lands as winner Brandon Nelson did in his semifinal match. Combined with other white commons, such as [Sanctified Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctified+Charge) and [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm), casting [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) became one of the leading ways to lead to victory.
