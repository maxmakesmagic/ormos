Hunt Bigger Game this year with ***Magic** 2015—Duels of the Planeswalkers* and discover a number of cool new things:




1. **Be at the heart of the story:** Players will find themselves dropped into the wilderness at the heart of the story: You’re not just on Garruk’s list—you’re next. The Curse of the Chain Veil has corrupted Garruk’s body and soul. His skin has paled, his flesh struck through with blackened veins. His hunter’s instinct has turned away from beasts of the wild toward the ultimate quarry—Planeswalkers! You will have to confront the deadliest hunter in the Multiverse. But, how will you defeat Garruk before he finds you?
2. **Full, Open-Ended Deck Building:** Players can build their own collection of cards to create any style of deck they want.
3. **Platforms:** It will be available on Xbox One, Xbox LIVE Arcade, iPad, PC via Steam, Android tablet via Amazon App Store and Google Play.
4. **New Content:** Five planes to explore and exciting virtual booster packs.
5. **Single and Multiplayer:** Battle the AI or your friends with your fully customized decks.
6. **New Cards:**
***Magic** 2015—Duels of the Planeswalkers* will feature some of the hottest cards from ***Magic** 2015*.
7. **Launch Date:** Coming soon in 2014!
