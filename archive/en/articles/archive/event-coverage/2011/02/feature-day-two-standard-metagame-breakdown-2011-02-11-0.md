The dust had settled after five rounds of Standard and three rounds of Mirrodin Besieged/Scars of Mirrodin Booster Draft; 172 players emerged with at least five wins to make the cut to Day Two. Of these Standard deck, ten posted impressive undefeated records. Three Caw-Go , two Valakut Ramp, and one each of Blue-Black Tezzeret, Tempered Steel, Kuldotha Red, Green-White Quest and Blue-Red-Black Tezzeret were guaranteed a spot on Friday with 5-0 starts. 


With five more rounds of Standad still to come, we would soon see which decks would come forth as the ones to beat. The complete Day Two metagame numbers are here for your leisure.
