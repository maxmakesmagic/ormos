Possess the Power!
Time Walk, Black Lotus, Ancestral Recall... cards of legend and staggering power. Now in **Magic Online**, you can own some of the most powerful and storied cards in **Magic** history, and play with that power in the Vintage format.


*Vintage Masters* Prerelease Events begin Friday, June 13, at 10:00 (AM) PDT and continue through Monday, June 16! We have a host of Draft events planned, as well as the Swiss Sealed event to give players a chance to build with *Vintage Masters*. Will you open a booster containing one of the famed Power 9 cards?


[**Learn more about the Vintage format!**](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrvintage) 
Â 

Can't make it to the Prerelease? Concerned that you'll miss out on your favorite event? Don't worry! All of the events from the Prerelease will continue through the Release window as well. Once the Prerelease ends, however, the Prerelease participation prizes will be gone for good and new participation prizes for the release period will take their place. Players will be able to earn all promos and avatars just by participating in the events that award them. Check out [the list below](#promos) to make sure you're able to get the promos and avatars you're interested in!


The launch of *Vintage Masters* marks the addition of the Vintage format to **Magic Online**, while the Classic format is being retired. We hope you enjoy the new experiences that *Vintage Masters*, and the Vintage format, bring to **Magic Online**.
