### Travel Tips


**Basic Travel Advice**  

Make 2 copies of your passport identification page. This will facilitate replacement if your passport is lost or stolen. Leave one copy at home with friends or relatives. Carry the other with you in a separate place from your passport.


Leave a copy of your itinerary with family or friends at home so that you can be contacted in case of an emergency.


If you get into trouble, contact your nearest embassy.


**Currency/Banks/ATMs**  

The unit of Japanese currency is the yen (indicated by ¥). Coin denominations are 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 yen. There are four denominations of paper money: 1,000 yen, 2,000 yen, 5,000 yen, and 10,000 yen.


Current exchange rates can be found at <http://www.xe.net/ucc/>. As of this writing (November 2003), the yen is hovering around 108 yen to the US dollar.


Money can be changed at major banks, exchange booths at airports and major hotels. The exchange of money is a regulated business, thus the rates are almost identical everywhere. **Major banks that handle foreign currencies are located in the downtown area of Kobe**. Banks are open from 9:00 to 15:00 on weekdays. They are closed on Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays.


Credit cards are not widely used. Many shops accept major credit cards, although some do not. Please inquire before making your purchase. Traveler's checks are accepted only by leading banks, and major hotels, and the use of traveler's checks in Japan is not as popular as in some other countries.


Do not expect to locate an ATM or bank to exchange foreign currency in Kobe.


**Electricity** In Kobe, the current is 60 hertz and 100 volts. Please be careful in using electrical appliances brought from overseas which may not meet Japanese requirements.

**Getting Around Kobe**  

Japan's public transportation system is one of the most developed and efficient in the world. Most major cities, including Kobe, are home to numerous rail companies and subways. English maps of the train system are available at any station. Tickets are available for purchase from automated vending machines found at train stations.


Taxis are also convenient for intra-city transportation. To flag down a taxi, look for a red light in the lower right corner of the windshield as you face it. Any other color means the taxi is reserved or occupied. Passengers enter the back door on the left side, which the driver opens and closes automatically. If you are visiting someone's home or company, be sure to have its location on a map, as an address is not enough, given the complicated street layouts in the big cities. Tipping is not practiced. Pay only the metered fare.
