| **1. Cake or Pie** | Impossible choice! If I could stuff one into the other, turducken style, I'd be happiest. |
| **2. Night or Day** | Day, grudgingly. I am an involuntary morning person -- I tend to get up with the sun. It might be due to my transparent eyelids. |
| **3. Truth or Dare** | Writing is all about Truth, man. |
| **4. Roller Coaster or Lazy River** | Lazy river, as long as I have good sunglasses. (Transparent eyelids.) |
| **5. Soft Candy or Hard Candy** | Hard candy. I have texture issues with things that are too mushy or gelatinous. Get thee behind me, flan! |
