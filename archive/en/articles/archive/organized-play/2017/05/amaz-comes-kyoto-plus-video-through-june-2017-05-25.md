We've got a lot to cover this week, and we're kicking things off with an update on Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*'s invited players.


Amaz Comes to Kyoto!
====================


We're excited to announce today that Jason Chan, better known as Amaz (and not to be confused with *Magic* artist [Jason Chan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Jason+Chan%22%5d)), has been given a special invitation to compete in Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*, which takes place July 28–30 in Kyoto, Japan! Amaz is a professional gamer who [regularly streams on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/amazhs) and has been an active streamer on most days for over three years. He is currently an active member on one of [NRG eSport's professional rosters](http://www.nrg.gg/).


Special invitations to the Pro Tour are occasionally and sparingly awarded at the sole discretion of Wizards of the Coast.


We look forward to seeing Amaz in Kyoto later this year!


Video Coverage Through June
===========================


With the Pro Tour and a few Grand Prix now behind us, I'd like to turn your attention to the rest of our Grand Prix schedule through June, with a look at what you can expect from the live video coverage that will be hosted at events for the next couple of weeks.


**Modern Double this Weekend**


Our next GP weekend with video is coming up in a few days, as Kobe and Copenhagen play host to the first Modern GPs following the release of *Amonkhet*. With [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Aggro solidifying itself as one of the key decks to beat out of Grand Prix Vancouver a couple of months back, will it put up a similar showing this weekend in both cities?


Copenhagen is getting the live video treatment this weekend, with the info below:


**May 26-28:** Grand Prix Kobe and Copenhagen


**Live Video from:** Grand Prix Copenhagen ([twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic))
