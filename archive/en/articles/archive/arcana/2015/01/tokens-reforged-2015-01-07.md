Small sets, like *Fate Reforged*, don't pack quite the same number of tokens typically as their big-set brethren. Fewer cards typically means fewer token producers, which means there just isn't a need for nearly as many tokens.



*Khans of Tarkir*, for example, [had thirteen different tokens](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/tokens-tarkir-2014-09-10), including multiple Warriors, emblems, and the now all-too-common morph reminder overlay. *Fate Reforged* has just four tokens.



But what *Fate Reforged* lacks in number, it certainly makes up for in "oomph" and uniqueness, with multiple tokens never printed anywhere before.



But I like my drama, so let's start with one you know and love, the classic Spirit token.

Simple, Abzan-y, and surely flying over defenses up and down your Prerelease.



We've also already shown you the manifest reminder overlay, but it's certainly worth another look. And, just for kicks, we've got the morph reminder overlay for comparison.

The next two tokens, however, are my favorites, in part because they go with such cool cards. The first is the dashing 2/1 black Warrior token, courtesy of Mardu Strike Leader.

Finally, we come to one of the most powerful tokens in quite a while, the simple-seeming Monk. Thanks to Monastery Mentor, these 1/1 white Monk creature tokens with prowess are likely to be part of some pretty formidable armies come the Prerelease on January 17.

But why stop there? It's a Wednesday, which is often the day we like to show off some of *Magic*'s best art. And, as much as you'll be seeing the manifest overlay over the next few months, you might as well get a good look at the Raymond Swanland art unbound by the card frame.
