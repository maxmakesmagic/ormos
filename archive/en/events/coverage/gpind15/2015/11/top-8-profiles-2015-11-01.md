Adding a second [Prairie Stream](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prairie+Stream) since I manifested it once and needed to cast two Strokes in one turn.

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel), it’s a surprise blowout!


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress); it won me a few games.


**If you could change one card anywhere in your deck what would it be and why?**  

None.


**What’s the best Halloween costume you’ve ever worn?**

**![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpind15/t8_perez.jpg)Name:** Ray “FuturePro” Perez, Jr.


**Age:** 25


**Hometown:** Lansing, MI


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** 2013-14 Rookie of the Year; Top 16 at Pro Tour *Theros.*  
  
**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Esper Tokens. \_FAB\_ got second in the *Magic Online* Championship Series with it and once I played it I found out it was insane. The deck has a great Dark Jeskai matchup.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). It applies so much pressure while having two great bodies to block.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar). It steals all the things.


**If you could change one card anywhere in your deck what would it be and why?**  

I would add another [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) main deck or sideboard because fliers are insane.


**What’s the best Halloween costume you’ve ever worn?**  

I once dressed up normally with a spray bottle of water. When someone asked me what I was, I responded by spraying myself and saying I drowned.

**Age:** 21


**Hometown:** Hoffman Estates, IL


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Day 2 at Grand Prix Madison


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Red-Green Landfall. It’s a dog to Dark Jeskai but has great matchups against the other top decks while staying consistent with 24 lands and [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector)s.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector). It provides a lot of value while also being a great aggressive 2-drop when combined with pump spells. The amount of games I won with it is insane.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** I have a special place in my heart for [Rending Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rending+Volley) for [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider)s.


**If you could change one card anywhere in your deck what would it be and why?** I’d probably cut the [Roast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roast)s. I brought them in for Tasigur out of Dark Jeskai and for Abzan but I found that I never needed them against Abzan and there are better cards to bring in for Dark Jeskai.


**What’s the best Halloween costume you’ve ever worn?** A bunch of costumes pieced together to have my costume be “a bad Halloween costume.”

**![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpind15/t8_chapin.jpg)Name:** Patrick Chapin


**Age:** 34


**Hometown:** Denver, CO


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

Hall of Fame, two-time Worlds finalist, five Pro Tour Top 8s, Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* champion.


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Esper Control – [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) plus Jace are the two best cards and this is the only deck that seemed good against Dark Jeskai. Team Ultra Pro told me to…


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). It costs less mana than it should, which I assume was a design/development decision.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**   
[Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor). It’s great when people take out some of their removal. It’s great against opponents that go big with Eldrazi or wide with tokens. It’s particularly valuable for avoiding draws.


**If you could change one card anywhere in your deck what would it be and why?**  

Maybe [Infinite Obliteration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infinite+Obliteration), I think another Mentor would have been better.


**What’s the best Halloween costume you’ve ever worn?**  

I was Frankenstein’s monster as a kid. I fell and bust my head open at breakfast and went to the emergency room and got stitches for it. I won “most realistic costume.”

**Age:** 24


**Hometown:** Chicago, IL


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Top 8 of a SCG Open


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Abzan. Midrange decks are always fun to play, and also [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) is great.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  

Surprisingly, [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree). It applies an absurd amount of pressure.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang). It’s usually a 4/5 for one mana.


**If you could change one card anywhere in your deck what would it be and why?**  
[Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) in the main deck varied widely from being horrendous to incredible.
