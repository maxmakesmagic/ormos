The Red Bull Untapped series is now in full swing! To date, we've had two online qualifiers in *MTG Arena*, with prize pools of $10,000 each—but that was just the start.


This weekend sees qualifiers in Florence, Italy, and Brussels, Belgium. Players will battle it out in multiformat events of Modern and *Modern Horizons* Limited. The stakes have been raised with these events, with prize pools of $60,000 each. What's more, the top two players will be qualified for the *MTG Arena* final at the Red Bull Gaming Sphere, London, UK, on August 4.


The overall winner of the Red Bull Untapped final in London will secure a spot in Mythic Championship VI in Richmond, Virginia.


It will be an action-packed weekend of Modern battles, and you can watch it all live! See the coverage of the Red Bull Untapped events at [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic) and [twitch.tv/redbull](http://www.twitch.tv/redbull).
