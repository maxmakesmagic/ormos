Here's another theory that gets great debate in R&D. Should we create cards or mechanics or names or flavor text, etc. that some group loves and another group hates. Is creating polarizing [elements](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-18) of the game good or bad? 

I'm in the camp that says yes, that strong reactions are good. I'm not advocating making cards/names/etc. that the majority of people hate. But I do believe it's a good thing to make cards that evoke strong feelings both directions. I think some players like cards simply because other players hate them.

The other camp says that we should never purposely make cards that we know anyone will hate. 

What do all of you believe? [Let me know](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-34).
