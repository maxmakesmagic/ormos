In the first Sunday draft prior to Round 13, draft table #3 looked more like a draft table #1. Kenji Tsumura and Yuuta Hirosawa set up with Kai/Ikeda on their right and Kaji/Saito to their right, with Thaler/Pils finishing off the table. When I saw this team play yesterday, they had taken half a step into Slivers, with [Sedge Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedge+Sliver) and [Homing Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Homing+Sliver) to tutor for him bringing a lot of Slivers in their wake. Would he take a similar half-step, or perhaps go farther? Tsumura is widely considered one of the great **Magic** minds of our time, and I was anticipating learning from a master.


Pack 1 opened with [Sulfurous Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfurous+Blast), [Amrou Seekers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Seekers), [Dark Withering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Withering), [Spined Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Sliver), [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow), [Bonesplitter Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter+Sliver), [Viscerid Deepwalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscerid+Deepwalker), [Ashcoat Bear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear), and [Weathered Bodyguards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weathered+Bodyguards). [Sulfurous Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfurous+Blast) was a gimme, followed by [Dark Withering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Withering). 


Pick 2 looked similar, offering [Amrou Seekers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Seekers), [Dark Withering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Withering), [Bonesplitter Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter+Sliver), and [Viscerid Deepwalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscerid+Deepwalker), as well as [Watcher Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watcher+Sliver) and [Shadow Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Sliver). Another [Dark Withering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Withering) and [Viscerid Deepwalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscerid+Deepwalker) joined the team.


Pick 3 showed a third Bonesplitter Siver, plus [Opaline Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Sliver), [Greenseeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greenseeker) and [Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback). The Japanese snapped back the [Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback), then weighed [Greenseeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greenseeker) vs. Bonesplitter. The [Greenseeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greenseeker) would be of more value to them, but if a single team cornered the market on all three Bonesplitters, [Spined Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Sliver), [Watcher Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watcher+Sliver), and [Shadow Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Sliver), all revealed by just the first three packs, things could get ugly. They took Bonesplitter next. If something like a [Sedge Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedge+Sliver) showed up, they always had the option to dally.


Pick 4 revealed [Pit Keeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Keeper), [Herd Gnarr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herd+Gnarr), [Spirit Loop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop), [Phyrexian Totem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Totem), and [Aetherflame Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflame+Wall). In a pick that surprised me, they took [Herd Gnarr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herd+Gnarr) and [Aetherflame Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflame+Wall), and the Wall made it into Hirosawa's deck. In the same way that [Flowstone Channeler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flowstone+Channeler) is better in Two-Headed giant because there will be more one-toughness-targets on the board for him, if [Aetherflame Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflame+Wall) says to some extent "Target shadow creature or [Grizzly Bears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears) can't attack," there will be more targets for that effect in 2HG as well.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptsdg07/Draft7_Hirosawa_Kenji.jpg)*Kenji and Hirosawa have proven over the weekend that they can work smoothly as a team.*By Pick 5, [Spined Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Sliver), [Ashcoat Bear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear), [Weathered Bodyguards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weathered+Bodyguards) and [Amrou Seekers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Seekers) had made it back around. [Spined Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Sliver) and [Amrou Seekers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Seekers) dove into the pile, keeping the window open for slivers down the line. The remnants of the pack added [Shadow Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Sliver), [Blazing Blade Askari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Blade+Askari), [Screeching Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Sliver), and [Tectonic Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Fiend).


The second **Time Spiral** pack offered [Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback), [Quilled Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quilled+Sliver), [Urborg Syphon-Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg+Syphon-Mage), [Zealot il-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zealot+il-Vec), [Prismatic Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens), and D'avenant Healer. Tapping for an 8-point life swing per turn in 2HG, the Syphon-Mage was a clear pick, and they added accelerator [Prismatic Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens) as well.


Pick 2 featured Haunting Hymm, [Watcher Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watcher+Sliver), [Looter il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor), [Celestial Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Crusader), [Coal Stoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker), and [Deathspore Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathspore+Thallid). Hymn and Looter were the most powerful cards, and went well with their 2 [Dark Withering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Withering)s.


Pick 3 continued this draft's theme of tons of awesome Slivers all over the pack. Oh, what could have been…[Trespasser il-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trespasser+il-Vec), [Watcher Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watcher+Sliver), [Telekinetic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telekinetic+Sliver), [Shadow Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Sliver), [Flowstone Channeler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flowstone+Channeler), and [Spike Tiller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Tiller). Having essentially abandoned the Slivers, Tsumura and Hirosawa took [Flowstone Channeler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flowstone+Channeler) and the Spike.


The rest of the pack provided [Dream Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Stalker), [Assassinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) and [Aether Web](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Web) as the cards that made their decks.


**Planar Chaos** arrived with a splash, featuring [Magus of the Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Coffers), [Blood Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight), [Shaper Parasite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite), [Rathi Trapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Trapper), [Giant Dustwasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Dustwasp), [Piracy Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy+Charm), and [Cradle to Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cradle+to+Grave). A very deep pack-what would you pick from it? Player of the Year Kenji Tsumura made his choice of [Rathi Trapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Trapper) and [Shaper Parasite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite). The next pick revealed [Sinew Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinew+Sliver), [Bog Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Serpent), [Stingscourger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingscourger), [Midnight Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm), [Whitemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitemane+Lion), and [Stormfront Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Riders). The Japanese took [Stingscourger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingscourger) and [Midnight Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm), eschewing the [Bog Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Serpent)'s clunky bulk for [Midnight Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm)'s sleek efficiency.


Pick 3 provided an incredible-in-2HG [Mire Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Boa) and its enemy [Midnight Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm). In Pick 4, they took [Needlepeak Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needlepeak+Spider), then chose the "you get more mana" removal, [Utopia Vow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Vow), over the "we get less mana" [Melancholy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melancholy).


By Pick 5, the [Blood Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight) had tabled and jumped into their pile, followed by [Amrou Seekers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Seekers)-wannabe [Skirk Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Shaman). The rest of the picks had dried up.


At the halfway mark in the draft, Hirosawa's deck sketch seemed very light on cards, having just [Sulfurous Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfurous+Blast) and some good two-drops, but not 50% of the cards to make a deckist, and he would need more attention in the second half of the draft. Kenji was on track to assembling a powerful blue-black removal machine. Meanwhile, Kai/Ikeda on their right had picked up [Sacred Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Mesa) and double [Celestial Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Crusader), and it looks like they were considering building one deck as entirely white, no doubt assisted by Tsumura/Hirosawa avoiding white altogether.


The judge gave the command, and the second **Planar Chaos** pack began. The powerful pack included Veiling Oddit, [Sulfur Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Elemental), 2HG superstar [Essence Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden), [Shaper Parasite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite), and the one-mana-removal trio of [Sunlance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunlance), [Piracy Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy+Charm), [Midnight Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm). The team considered [Sulfur Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Elemental) and [Essence Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden) for a long time, but finally went with [Shaper Parasite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite) and [Veiling Oddity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veiling+Oddity). Despite the Oddity's greatly improved value in 2HG, I was surprised by the pick of the suspend Illusion over [Essence Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden). But because it was Kenji, I tried to expand my mind to follow his reasoning and learn from him. I'm sure that part of the reason was Kenji's paucity of two-drops so far.


In Pick 2, [Pouncing Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pouncing+Wurm) and [Utopia Vow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Vow) were easy picks over [Melancholy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melancholy) and [Reflex Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflex+Sliver). Pick 3 gave them [Blood Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight) and [Gossamer Phantasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gossamer+Phantasm) and continued the "Packed with Slivery goodness" theme with Poultice, Reflex, and [Spitting Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Sliver)s, a higher frequency of the good common Slivers than most drafts.


In Pick 4, the team chose [Wild Pair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) and [Midnight Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm) over [Needlepeak Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needlepeak+Spider) and [Midnight Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm), and they picked up an [Aquamorph Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity) before the cards fell off the edge of playability.


As *Future Sight* became the present, the first pick showed [Whip-Spine Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip-Spine+Drake), [Aven Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Augur), [Fatal Attraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Attraction), [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee), [Magus of the Abyss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Abyss), and [Nessian Courser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser). Hirosawa was excited about the Abyss, which doubles in effect in 2HG, but Kenji waved his hand and shunned both Abyss and [Whip-Spine Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip-Spine+Drake) to first-pick straight card advantage and removal, in [Fatal Attraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Attraction) and [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee).


For the second pick, Kenji took [Grave Scrabbler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler) and [Sporoloth Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporoloth+Ancient). Knowing the team wouldn't play white helped them ignore [Seht's Tiger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seht%27s+Tiger) and [Knight of Sursi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Sursi). At the third pick, Kenji and Yuuta were definitely taking [Imperiosaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperiosaur), but [Llanowar Empath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Empath), [Deepcavern Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepcavern+Imp), and [Edge of Autumn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn) jostled for second place. With multiple dark Witherings and a [Grave Scrabbler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler), the [Deepcavern Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepcavern+Imp)'s discard "drawback" was too good to pass up.


The fourth pick added another [Grave Scrabbler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler) and a hate-draft [Lymph Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lymph+Sliver), while the another [Grave Scrabbler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler) and [Lymph Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lymph+Sliver) in the following pick finished off the reasonable cards in the round.


I glanced at the Germans during the review period, and saw Florian Pils assembling a fast beatdown strategy with [Shade of Trokair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shade+of+Trokair), [Knight of Sursi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Sursi), [Essence Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden), 2 [Sinew Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinew+Sliver), 2 [Ashcoat Bear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear), 2 [Whitemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitemane+Lion), 2 [Thrill of the Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrill+of+the+Hunt), and [Serra Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Avenger). If Thaler is just as beatdown-focused, they could be trying to turn the tables on the slower [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee)-based strategies of their opponents.


The final pack of the draft began. The madness-enabling [Gathan Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gathan+Raiders) and [Death Rattle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Rattle) were an easy pick over [Pact of the Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+the+Titan) and [Edge of Autumn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn). The next pick was a lot tougher, with [Deepcavern Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepcavern+Imp) and [Edge of Autumn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn) fighting to accompany the powerful [Sprout Swarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprout+Swarm) into the pile. The duo had picked both Imp and Edge earlier in the draft, and this was a question of curves, numbers, and deck needs. [Edge of Autumn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn) won the fight. 


![Gibbering Descent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gibbering+Descent)
The third pick donated another [Edge of Autumn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn) as well as a card that got Tsumura and Hirosawa excitedly chattering: [Gibbering Descent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gibbering+Descent). The rare enchantment doubles in effect in Two-Headed Giant, hitting the opposing team for two cards and 2 life a turn. They could get it out cheaply and on-curve with discard enablers like [Gathan Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gathan+Raiders) and [Deepcavern Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepcavern+Imp), or they can use the Descent itself to play out their other madness cards like [Dark Withering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Withering). Interestingly, you can also do something with Descent in 2HG that you can't do with in one-on-one. If Kenji controls [Gibbering Descent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gibbering+Descent) and is hellbent with no cards, his whole team can skip its upkeep and thus skip Descent's negative effects, while Yuuta can still hold cards and even build them up without discarding to Descent. [Second Wind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Wind) wrapped up the playable cards, and the draft was over.


I watched Kenji and Yuuta build their decks. Kenji's blue-black was packed with card advantage, with Haunting Hymm, Gibbering Descet, [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee), 2 [Grave Scrabbler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler)s, 2 [Shaper Parasite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite)s, [Dream Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Stalker) to run those again, [Gibbering Descent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gibbering+Descent), and [Looter il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor) with Madness cards. One of the 3 [Midnight Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm)s got cut, as did one of the 3 [Grave Scrabbler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler)s. After seeing Finkel's 2HG madness deck "go off" with 3 [Grave Scrabbler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler)s and some looters, I asked Kenji why he cut one [Grave Scrabbler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler), even though he liked them enough to run 2. He explained that although he has a decent number of madness outlets, they're not as reliable at discarding cards as Wild Mongrel is. Kenji said "These [[Deepcavern Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepcavern+Imp) and [Gathan Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gathan+Raiders)] only discard once. These [[Urborg Syphon-Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg+Syphon-Mage) and [Looter il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor)] are must-kill." It makes a lot of sense that opponents are usually going to kill the 8-point-life-swinging [Urborg Syphon-Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg+Syphon-Mage) and the [Looter il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor) on sight, so they can't be relied upon to provide a consistent discard outlet. I also talked with Kenji about playing 2 out of 3 [Midnight Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm)s, asking him if he liked [Midnight Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm) better in 2HG because there are more potential targets for it than in one-on-one. He said that was the reason he liked [Midnight Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm) in 2HG, and also called out [Essence Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden) and [Mire Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Boa) as 2HG-empowered weenies that are great targets for the Charm.


Hirosawa is playing a pretty traditional red-green with double [Blood Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight), [Mire Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Boa), and [Wild Pair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), but not many super crazy things to tutor with it. Just playing a 2/2 and getting another 2/2 of your choice makes [Wild Pair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) good enough, and taking it keeps it out of the hands of any Dliver player who would make the enchantment really ridiculous.


Their [Veiling Oddity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veiling+Oddity), [Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback), [Gossamer Phantasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gossamer+Phantasm), and [Bog Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Serpent) did not make the cut.
