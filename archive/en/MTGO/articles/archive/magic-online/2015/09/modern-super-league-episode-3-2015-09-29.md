Tonight we determine the first ever Modern Super League champion! How cool is it that with four players left, we still have four different countries represented? In fact, we still have three different continents!

The winner between Patrick and Cedric will be 3-0 and through to the finals. The loser can still get there by beating the winner of Shaun McLaren versus Lee Shi Tian. Of course, since it's double-elimination, we might still have two players with just one loss after Match 14 (if the X-1 player wins). If that happens, it triggers a fifteenth and final match.


The remaining decks are a nice spread of what works in Modern right now: Twin, Zoo, Jund, and Elves. You've got some combo, some beatdown, and some midrange. There's no true control decks having a lot of success these days (as evidenced by Shaun abandoning his Jeskai roots in favor of Jund). You can see all the decklists [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/modern-super-league-decklists-2015-09-15).

The match between Lee and McLaren actually has larger implications beyond the MSL. The winner qualifies automatically for the Super League Championship that starts on October 27, while the loser will be relegated to the Last Chance Qualifier event on October 20. Keep your eye on DailyMTG, by the way, for your chance to vote on which other players should get to play in that Last Chance Qualifier.
