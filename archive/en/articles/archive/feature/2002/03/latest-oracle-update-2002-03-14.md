Latest Oracle Update
====================

For fans of rules minutiae, here is the latest Oracle update in its entirety.

The **Magic** rules team is constantly working to make sure old cards (written under old rules) are compatible with the current system. As such, some old cards need their wordings "tweaked."

These changes reflect how the cards will be treated in tournaments. If you are playing for fun, the Oracle can be used to clarify old wordings or settle disputes regarding rules.

Some playgroups choose to play cards "as written," but please be aware that the Oracle should be used as the final arbiter when no other resolutions can be reached.

### 03/01/02 Oracle Changes

The 03/01/02 Oracle update has fixed many minor problems with card wordings. This is a comprehensive list of the significant changes, in four parts:

- Formatting changes. Several card names have been reformatted into ASCII text.
- Functional errata to fix problem cards.
- Errata to correct cards to their printed functionality
- Minor changes to cards, for clarity.
The Oracle can be found [here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/main.asp?x=Oracle).

### 1. Formatting Changes

Card names have been changed in Oracle to remove accented characters and the “AE” symbol so that they appear correctly in all languages. This does not change the functionality of any cards:


> [AErathi Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=AErathi+Berserker); [AEther Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=AEther+Barrier); [AEther Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=AEther+Burst); [AEther Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=AEther+Flash); [AEther Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=AEther+Mutation); [AEther Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=AEther+Rift); [AEther Sting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=AEther+Sting); [AEther Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=AEther+Storm); [AEther Tide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=AEther+Tide); [Bosium Strip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosium+Strip); [Dandan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dandan); [El-Hajjaj](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=El-Hajjaj); [Ghazban Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghazban+Ogre); [Ifh-Biff Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ifh-Biff+Efreet); [Junun Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Junun+Efreet); [Juzam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juzam+Djinn); [Khabal Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khabal+Ghoul); [Legions of Lim-Dul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legions+of+Lim-Dul); [Lim-Dul's Cohort](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lim-Dul%27s+Cohort); [Lim-Dul's Hex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lim-Dul%27s+Hex); [Lim-Dul's High Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lim-Dul%27s+High+Guard); [Lim-Dul's Paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lim-Dul%27s+Paladin); [Lim-Dul's Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lim-Dul%27s+Vault); [Marton Stromgald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marton+Stromgald); [Oath of Lim-Dul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Lim-Dul); [Ring of Ma'ruf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ring+of+Ma%27ruf); [Tainted AEther](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+AEther)
> 
> 

There have been several other minor changes to the formatting of Oracle, to make it clearer in ASCII text. The most obvious change is the treatment of mana symbols. Each mana symbol is now enclosed in curly braces “{},” to distinguish it from a normal number.

### 2. Errata to correct problems with cards



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Old Oracle Text** | **New Oracle Text** | **Changes** |
| [Autumn Willow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Autumn+Willow)4GG Creature — Legend4/4 Autumn Willow can't be the target of spells or abilities.G: Until end of turn, target player may target Autumn Willow with spells or abilities as though it could be the target of spells or abilities. | [Autumn Willow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Autumn+Willow){4}{G}{G}Creature -- Legend4/4Autumn Willow can't be the target of spells or abilities.{G}: Until end of turn, Autumn Willow may be the target of spells and abilities controlled by target player as though it did not have "Autumn Willow can't be the target of spells or abilities." | The original wording of Autumn Willow fell under our “can/can’t” rule. If one effect says you can do something, and another effect says you can’t do something, the one that says “can’t” wins. The new wording sidesteps this problem. |
| [Beasts of Bogardan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beasts+of+Bogardan)4R Creature — Beast3/3 Protection from redBeasts of Bogardan gets +1/+1 as long as any opponent controls a white card. | [Beasts of Bogardan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beasts+of+Bogardan){4}{R}Creature -- Beast3/3Protection from redBeasts of Bogardan gets +1/+1 as long as any opponent controls a white permanent. | The phrase “controls a white card” had an unintuitive corner case involving spells on the stack. This corner case was removed by changing “card” to “permanent”  |
| [Broken Visage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Visage)4BInstantDestroy target attacking nonartifact creature. It can't be regenerated. Put a black Shadow creature token into play with power and toughness equal to the power and toughness of that creature. Sacrifice the Shadow token at end of turn. | [Broken Visage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Visage){4}{B}InstantDestroy target attacking nonartifact creature. It can't be regenerated. Put a black Spirit creature token into play with power and toughness equal to the power and toughness of that creature. Sacrifice the Spirit token at end of turn. | The token’s name and creature type are now “Spirit”. Previously, its name and creature type were “Shadow,” which could be confused with the keyword ability of the same name. |
| [Call to Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Arms)1WEnchantmentAs Call to Arms comes into play, choose a color.White creatures get +1/+1.When any one opponent controls as many or more cards of a single color than the chosen color, sacrifice Call to Arms. | [Call to Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Arms){1}{W}EnchantmentAs Call to Arms comes into play, choose a color and an opponent.White creatures get +1/+1.When the chosen color isn't the most common color among permanents the chosen opponent controls, sacrifice Call to Arms. | Call to Arms has been returned to its printed functionality of only checking one opponent. Also, the phrase “controls as many or more cards” had an unintuitive corner case involving spells on the stack. This corner case was removed by changing “card” to “permanent” |
| [Camouflage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Camouflage)GInstantTurn your attacking creatures face down and arrange them as you choose. When blockers are declared, turn the cards face up again. Remove all illegal blockers from combat. Creatures blocked only by illegal blockers become unblocked. | [Camouflage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Camouflage){G}InstantTurn your attacking creatures face down and arrange them as you choose. At the beginning of the declare blockers step, turn those creatures face up again. Creatures blocked only by illegal blockers become unblocked. Remove all illegal blockers from combat. | The old wording would leave all creatures face-down if no blockers were declared. It also had the last two sentences in the incorrect order. Both of these problems have been fixed with the new wording. |
| [Chain Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Lightning)RSorceryWhenever Chain Lightning deals damage to a creature or player this turn, that player or that creature’s controller may pay RR. If he or she does, Chain Lightning deals 3 damage to target creature or player of his or her choice.Chain Lightning deals 3 damage to target creature or player. | [Chain Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Lightning){R}SorceryChain Lightning deals 3 damage to target creature or player. Then that player or that creature's controller may pay {R}{R}. If the player does, he or she may put a copy of this spell on the stack. He or she may choose a new target for that copy. | The new wording now functions correctly. The spell can be countered at any point in the chain of bounces, not just at the start. |
| [Chain Stasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Stasis)UInstantWhenever Chain Stasis taps or untaps a creature this turn, that creature's controller may pay 2U. If that player does, tap or untap target creature.Tap or untap target creature. | [Chain Stasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Stasis){U}InstantTap or untap target creature. Then that creature's controller may pay {2}{U}. If the player does, he or she may put a copy of this spell on the stack. He or she may choose a new target for that copy. | The new wording now functions correctly. The spell can be countered at any point in the chain of bounces, not just at the start. |
| [Desperate Gambit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Gambit)RInstantChoose a spell or permanent you control and flip a coin. If you win the flip, the next time that source would deal damage this turn, double that damage.

If you win the flip, the next time that source would deal damage this turn, it deals double that damage instead. If you lose the flip, the next time it would deal damage this turn, prevent that damage. | Changed so that you can now choose any source you control, not just a spell or a permanent. |
| [Encroach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Encroach)BSorceryLook at target player's hand and choose a nonbasic land card from it.

That player discards that card. | Changed from “look at target player's hand,” to “target player reveals his or her hand,” so that the resolution can be verified by all players. |
| [Honorable Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honorable+Passage)1WInstantThe next time a source of your choice would deal damage to you or target creature this turn, prevent that damage.

If damage from a red source is prevented this way, Honorable Passage deals that much damage to the source's controller. | Now says “target creature or player,” to match the way it’s used in real life. With the previous wording, it was impossible to play the spell if there were no creatures in play. |
| [Inquisition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition)2BSorceryLook at target player’s hand. Inquisition deals X damage to that player, where X is the number of white cards in his or her hand. | [Inquisition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition){2}{B}SorceryTarget player reveals his or her hand. Inquisition deals damage to that player equal to the number of white cards in his or her hand. | Changed from “look at target player's hand,” to “target player reveals his or her hand,” so that the resolution can be verified by all players. |
| [Ivory Guardians](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Guardians)4WW Creature — Guardian3/3 Protection from redAll Guardians get +1/+1 as long as an opponent controls a red card. | [Ivory Guardians](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Guardians){4}{W}{W}Creature -- Guardian3/3Protection from redAll Guardians get +1/+1 as long as an opponent controls a red permanent. | The phrase “controls a red card” had an unintuitive corner case involving spells on the stack. This corner case was removed by changing “card” to “permanent” |
| [Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich)BBBBEnchantmentWhen Lich comes into play, your life total becomes 0.You don’t lose the game for having 0 or less life.If you would gain life, draw that many cards instead.Whenever you're dealt damage, sacrifice that many permanents.When Lich leaves play, you lose the game. | [Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich){B}{B}{B}{B}EnchantmentAs Lich comes into play, your life total becomes 0.You don't lose the game for having 0 or less life.If you would gain life, draw that many cards instead.Whenever you're dealt damage, sacrifice that many permanents.When Lich leaves play, you lose the game. | You now lose life as Lich comes into play. It’s no longer a triggered ability. |
| [Lotus Vale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Vale)LandWhen Lotus Vale comes into play, you may sacrifice two untapped lands. If you don't, sacrifice Lotus Vale. If you do, Lotus Vale gains "T: Add three mana of any one color to your mana pool." | [Lotus Vale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Vale)LandIf Lotus Vale would come into play, sacrifice two untapped lands instead.

At end of turn, destroy each of those creatures that didn't attack this turn. Play this ability only during an opponent's turn and only before attackers are declared. | In the old wording, “each of those creatures” was ambiguous. The new wording is designed to solve that problem. |
| [Necropolis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropolis)5 Artifact Creature — Wall0/1 #(Walls can’t attack.)#Remove a creature card in your graveyard from the game: Put a +0/+X counter on Necropolis, where X is the removed card’s converted mana cost. | [Necropolis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropolis){5}Artifact Creature -- Wall0/1#(Walls can't attack.)#Remove a creature card in your graveyard from the game: Put X +0/+1 counters on Necropolis, where X is the removed card's converted mana cost. | The counters are now X +0/+1 counters, rather than one +0/+X counter. This makes bookkeeping much easier. |

If a creature dealt damage by the targeted creature would be put into a graveyard this turn, remove that creature from the game instead. | Previously, the “can’t be regenerated” ability was a triggered ability, which could never work. It has been updated to be a continuous effect. |
| [Scorched Ruins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scorched+Ruins)LandWhen Scorched Ruins comes into play, you may sacrifice two untapped lands.
