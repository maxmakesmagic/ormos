In 1996 and 1997, the early days of the popular Arena League, participants were given a promotional basic land card just for participating in the program. The five lands, all illustrated by Tony Roberts, had art that joined together to make one long illustration (just like the [*Ice Age* Plains](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/68).)

While the lands are no longer available, the League continues on with cool foil cards as prizes. Click **[here](http://archive.wizards.com/arena/main.asp?x=magic)** to learn more about Arena and where it is played near you.
