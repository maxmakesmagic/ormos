Steve O'Mahoney-Schwartz vs. Alan Comer


Round seven saw the day close with Steve O'Mahoney-Schwartz with Forbidian taking on Alan Comer and his "Suicide Brown" Tinker deck, with both at 5-1, each was playing for position toward the top eight. OMS won the coin toss and chose to play, opening with a Thawing Glacier, and an island, not enough to stop Comer playing a Mana Vault and Thran Dynamo turn two. After OMS played a wasteland, Comer tossed down a Phyrexian Processor on turn four. Steve looked hard at his hand and the three mana he had available before allowing it to resolve.


"Are you sure?" was Comer's response. OMS tried to match up with a Powder Keg, which he added a counter to, and a Morphling, but the shapeshifter was Mana Leaked, with Comer following on his turn with a Null Brooch, slamming the door on OMS's chances, spurring him to concede game one and Mark Rosewater to say "I blinked, what happened?"


1-0 Comer


O'Mahoney-Schwartz had to take a mulligan game two, noting that all he drew for counters in game one was a Force Spike. Unfortunately, they didn't decide to show for the second game either as Comer played a Cursed Scroll, Voltaic Key, Mana Vault and Thran Dynamo on the first three turns before OMS finally Force of Willed his Null Brooch. With the remaining mana, however, Comer tinkered away his Mana Vault for a Phyrexian Processor, paying 10 life.


Despite getting a Treachery on one token and quicksand-blocking another, the 10/10 beasts kept coming for Comer's Phyrexian army and OMS quickly scooped.


2-0 Comer
