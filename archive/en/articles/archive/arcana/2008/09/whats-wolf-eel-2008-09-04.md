Let's say you're a **Magic** artist. And you're given this art description for a card named "[Whimwader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whimwader)":


> Color: Blue  
>  Location: your choice  
>  Action: This is an elemental, which in [SETNAME] means it's a manifestation of fears, anxieties, or nightmares that incorporates animal elements. This particular elemental is a huge creature "can smell thoughts." How to represent this is up to you. One idea is to show an enormous creature that resembles a two-faced eyeless wolf-eel covered with strange, arcane patterns. It "swims" along the ground -- the ground underneath it magically becomes fluidic to allow its passage, whether it's rocks, dirt, or whatever.  
>  Focus: the "thought-seeking" elemental  
>  Mood: surreal, creepy, cold  
>  Notes: All elementals should feel transitory or intangible somehow, as though they're "just passing through" reality.

You'd probably turn in something like this, if you were as good an artist as Jeff Easley:
