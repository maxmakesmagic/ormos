Send your rules questions to **Magic** Rules Manager [John Carter](javascript:makeWinXY('/company/emailtoauthor.asp?author=John%20Carter&headline=Rules%20Question',500,455);). Can't find the answer to your question somewhere else, like the [**Magic** Comprehensive Rules](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/rules/tourneyplayer)? Maybe he's already answered it! Try the [Saturday School Searchable Rules Database](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/satschoolarchive).


In August we opened this session of Saturday School. At the time, the closing statement was, “I hope you've been paying attention; there just might be a test.” Well, guess what, we weren't kidding. For the last two weeks there have been hints and innuendos, and now you get the real thing. So, have some fun, and let's see how you do.


First, a few rules: the questions assume sufficient mana to pay for things unless a specific amount of land or mana is stated. Any other permanents are irrelevant to the question (though I reserve the right to include irrelevant items just to be difficult). The basis for each question focuses on the two blocks legal during the current year plus a few general questions.


Browsers ready?  

 You may begin.


1. The converted mana cost of a [Broodstar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodstar) being played while you control nine artifacts is:


a) 1  

 b) ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

 c) ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

 d) 10  

 e) ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220908064341im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless8.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



d) 10. Affinity reduces the total cost of a spell but does not change its converted mana cost. Converted mana cost does not include color.



2. The maximum amount of damage you can deal with a [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) and [Roar of the Kha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Kha) is:


a) 1  

 b) 2  

 c) 3  

 d) 4  

 e) 5


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



d) 4. Activate the [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin), and play [Roar of the Kha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Kha) with entwine in response. The Goblin untaps and becomes a 2/3. The original activation uses the Goblin's current power when the ability resolves [CR 402.6]. Since the Goblin is untapped, it can be activated a second time for an additional two damage.



3. Controlling a player's turn with [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) allows you to:


a) See the player's hand  

 b) See the player's face down permanents  

 c) Have the player concede  

 d) Have the player activate [Lethal Vapors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lethal+Vapors) 1000 times  

 e) A, B, and D


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



e) A, B, and D. When controlling another player's turn [CR 507] you have all the access to information they would have, and you can make all decisions for them in the game (such as activating [Lethal Vapors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lethal+Vapors) repeatedly in response to cause many skipped turns), but you may not force an opponent to concede.




![Illuminate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Illuminate)

 4. Paul has three cards in his library. He plays [Illuminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illuminate) with the blue kicker and X= 4 on a [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) he stole from Cari. What happens?

 a) The [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) is put into Paul's graveyard and Paul draws three cards, then the game ends.  

 b) The [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) is put into Cari's graveyard and Paul draws three cards, then the game ends.  

 c) The [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) takes 4 damage, Paul draws three cards, the [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) is put into Paul's graveyard, and the game ends.  

 d) The [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) takes 4 damage, Paul draws three cards, the [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) is put into Cari's graveyard, and the game ends.  

 e) The [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) takes 4 damage, Paul draws three cards, the [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) is put into Cari's graveyard, and the game continues.


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



e) …the game continues. [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) was in play at the time when Paul attempted to draw but could not. The Angel is put into the graveyard as he should be losing, but the Angel's ability still applies. When state-based effects are rechecked, Paul has not drawn since the last time SBEs were checked [CR 420.5g].



5. Which of the following works well with [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail)?


a) [Phage the Untouchable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phage+the+Untouchable)  

 b) The Myojins  

 c) [Phyrexian Dreadnought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought)  

 d) [Furnace Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon)  

 e) None of the above


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



e) None of the above. [Phyrexian Dreadnought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought)'s replacement applies no matter how it is being put into play. The rest of the cards have benefits (or avoid drawbacks) only if they were played from your hand. Being put into play is a different type of action than actually playing something, though the outcome appears to be the same.



6. Indestructible means:


a) Unable to be eliminated from play  

 b) Destruction effects are ignored  

 c) Destruction effect are prevented  

 d) Destruction effects are replaced by "do nothing"  

 e) None of the above


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



b) Destruction effects are ignored. This includes destruction from effects that read “destroy” and “destroy… can't be regenerated” as well as the lethal damage state-based effect. Indestructible does not prevent or replace destruction.



7. How many cards were reprinted in *Darksteel*?


a) One  

 b) Two  

 c) Three  

 d) Four  

 e) None


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



c) Three. [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball), [Inflame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inflame), and [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) are all reprints. [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) last saw print in *Fifth Edition* (and the Beatdown Box). [Inflame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inflame) debuted in *Prophecy*. [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) was last in Revised.



8. Lindsay has a [Neurok Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Transmuter) and one untapped Island. What mana would Samantha need to steal Lindsay's Transmuter with [Memnarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch)?

 e) It's impossible to successfully use [Memnarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch) with a Transmuter in play


[Answer](javascript:void(0))

Samantha uses [Memnarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch) to make the Transmuter into an artifact (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)). She then tries to take the Transmuter (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)), and Lindsay responds by activating the Transmuter's second ability.

![Arcbound Reclaimer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arcbound+Reclaimer)

 9. Can [Arcbound Reclaimer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Reclaimer) return itself to the top of your library?

 a) Yes, if you pay costs in the correct order  

 b) No, it's impossible


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



b) No. Targets are chosen before costs are paid. At the time the target for the ability would be chosen, the Reclaimer still has counters on it. Even if costs were able to be paid first, the Reclaimer wouldn’t be put into the graveyard until SBEs had checked—after the entire ability had been played.



10. Can [Quicksilver Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Elemental) copy and use the ability granted by a [Leonin Bola](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Bola) that is equipped to an opponent's creature?


a) Yes, but the Bola will become unattached once the Elemental is activated  

 b) Yes, as often as you can untap the Elemental  

 c) No, the copied ability was created by the Elemental, not by the Bola, so it doesn’t have anything to unattach  

 d) No, you cannot unattach equipment from a creature you don't control  

 e) No, the Elemental cannot copy the granted ability


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



a) Yes, but the Bola will become unattached from whichever creature it’s equipping once the Elemental is activated. [Leonin Bola](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Bola) grants an ability to the equipped creature. [Quicksilver Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Elemental) can copy the grant ability. Activating the Bola requires only that it be attached somewhere. As part of the costs for activating the ability the equipment becomes unattached.



11. The Sunburst mechanic owes its origin to which card?


a) [Saproling Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saproling+Burst)  

 b) [Glissa Sunseeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa+Sunseeker)  

 c) [Emblazoned Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emblazoned+Golem)  

 d) [Chariot of the Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chariot+of+the+Sun)  

 e) [Sunscape Master](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Master)


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



c) [Emblazoned Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emblazoned+Golem). The [Mycosynth Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mycosynth+Golem)'s best friend is the direct ancestor of the Sunburst mechanic. Instead of kicker's additional cost with [Emblazoned Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emblazoned+Golem) (which Mycosynth Golem can reduce to great effect), Sunburst puts the multiple colors benefit directly into the cost of a card. Both Sunburst and Kicker are very ineffective when using reanimation effects though.




![Fist of Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fist+of+Suns)

 12. [Fist of Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fist+of+Suns) allows a Myojin to get a divinity counter.

 a) Yes  

 b) No


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



a) Yes. Using ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) to pay for a spell's mana cost doesn't change the fact it's being played and being played from your hand.



13. Eric is playing against Rob. Eric plays [Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) with [Future Sight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Future+Sight) in play. What card(s) will Rob get to see?


a) All the cards Eric sees  

 b) The top card of the library once the [Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) resolves  

 c) The top card of the library, the card just below that when Eric draws, and the top card once Eric is done scrying  

 d) The top card of the library, the card just below that when Eric draws  

 e) The top card of the library and the top card once Eric is done scrying


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



c) The top card of the library, the card just below that when Eric draws, and the top card once Eric is done scrying. Rob will see all the cards except the second card down while scrying. If Eric puts that second card on top, it will be seen. If Eric leaves the second card second or puts it on the bottom, Rob will never see it.



14. How much mana would a player need to spend with a [Gorilla Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorilla+Shaman) to destroy an [Engineered Explosives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) with one charge counter on it?


a) 1  

 b) 2  

 c) 3  

 d) 4  

 e) 5


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



a) 1. The value of X in a mana cost equals 0 if the card is in play [CR Glossary: X]. 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.



15. Nick has a large amount of mana and attacks Jay with a [Myr Quadropod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Quadropod). Nick can deal lethal damage to Jay if he switches the Quadropod's power and toughness. Jay does not have any creatures to declare as blockers. When is the best time for Jay to play a [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) targeting the Quadropod?


a) Before declining to block  

 b) In response to Nick's first switch  

 c) After resolving the first switch but before stacking damage  

 d) After the first switch and after damage is stacked  

 e) After declaring no blockers, waiting for Nick to switch, resolving the switch and passing priority again


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



b) In response to Nick's first switch. If Jay uses the [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) early, Nick will not switch the P/T and will whittle more of Jay's life away. If Jay waits for the first switch to resolve, Nick can switch the P/T again to survive the [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock). Jay passing priority after the first switch has resolved and stacking damage after the switch has resolved are functionally identical—both result in Jay losing. If jay [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)s in response to the first switch, then no matter how many times Nick could activate the switch ability the first one to resolve will result in a lethally damaged 4/1 Quadropod.

a) Clone  

 b) Legend  

 c) Nekrataal  

 d) Wall

18. Dan attacks with a [Kashi-Tribe Reaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kashi-Tribe+Reaver) and [Keiga, the Tide Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+the+Tide+Star). Becky blocks with [Kami of Old Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Old+Stone) and a 5/5 flying token. When Keiga's leaves play trigger resolves, Dan takes the Kami. Will Dan be able to untap the Kami on his turn?

 b) Yes, but only if he takes the Kami on his turn  

 c) No, the Kami is remains tapped until he skips an untap

 b) Are checked as the last action every turn  

 c) Are checked every step or phase  

 d) Destroy creatures with zero or less toughness

 b) When costs are paid  

 c) When announced and when costs are paid respectively  

 d) Once the player has received priority  

 e) Once the player passes priority


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



c) When announced and when costs are paid respectively. Being put on the stack is part of announcing the spell [CR 409.1a]. Once costs are paid, the spell is officially played [CR 409.1i]. No player gets priority in between these steps, but it's where all the normal choices for a spell or ability are made.



24. Converted mana cost never changes.


a) Yes  

 b) No


[Answer](javascript:void(0))



a) Yes. Converted mana cost normally never changes, but if something has an X in the cost and if it's on the stack, then the X variable will be set to the value chosen while playing the spell or ability [CR 409.1b]. In all other zones, the X is defined as always being 0 [CR Glossary: X].



Time's up.


Make sure your name is… oh wait, they didn't let me give you bubble forms to fill out. Ah well, maybe if we do well the school board will let us do more complicated tests in the future. I hope this year wasn't too grueling. I won't make any promises about 2005 though.


Enjoy your holidays (if you haven't already that is). For this column, the next two weeks will be special retro content (rather than pure reprint columns). I'll be back in January when we'll be handling your questions again and looking forward to the *Betrayers of Kamigawa* previews and prereleases.


Class dismissed. Happy holidays!
