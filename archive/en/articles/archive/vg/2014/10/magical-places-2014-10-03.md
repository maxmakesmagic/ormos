Last week featured the first broadcasted Standard and Legacy event featuring *Khans of Tarkir*, the season finale to *Spellslingers*, and [one sweet Vintage match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6plGRFD2Zfk&safe=active) among many.


This week, we've got the Gag Reel finale, as well as some more *Khans of Tarkir* coming (this time, Limited).


As a heads-up: the Vintage Super League is taking time off in lieu of next weekend's Pro Tour, as both host Randy Buehler and many of the League competitors will be in Honolulu either working or competing. Stay tuned to the Viewing Guide and [VintageSuperLeague.com](http://vintagesuperleague.com/) for more details on the next episode.

The *Spellslingers* Season 2 finale aired last week with Sean "Day[9]" Plott's battle against Frag Doll Michelle "Esper" Roberson. However, that doesn't mean the fun is over. The gag reel from the season finale is now posted! You can watch all the hilarity below!

Tune in this weekend to witness the new set, *Khans of Tarkir*, in action for the first time at a Grand Prix! With more than 1,100 players already preregistered for this event as of me writing this, Grand Prix Orlando is sure to be a phenomenal spectacle of *Khans of Tarkir* Limited action.


Live video coverage for this weekend is managed by the SCGLive crew from [StarCityGames.com](http://www.starcitygames.com/). Join hosts Cedric Phillips, Patrick Sullivan, and Matthias Hunt as they bring you every bit of *Khans of Tarkir* Limited goodness for two days of nonstop action! The coverage begins Saturday at 10 a.m. ET/2 p.m. GMT, and resumes again on Sunday at 9 a.m. ET/1 p.m. GMT.
