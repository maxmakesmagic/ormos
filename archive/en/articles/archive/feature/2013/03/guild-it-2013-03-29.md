Our friends over at **Dungeons & Dragons** get to have all the fun. Their alignment chart has spawned countless memes as their players use the grid to assign characters and people to their relevant alignments.


All the while **Magic** as stood by and let this injustice happen. Well, no longer!


Below I present to you a handy template that you and your friends can use to share and work with.


First is the most rudimentary where you just can put pictures in the boxes.

Second is a more advanced but prettier version which makes use of transparent backgrounds such that if you have the graphics tools and the knowhow you can use this.
