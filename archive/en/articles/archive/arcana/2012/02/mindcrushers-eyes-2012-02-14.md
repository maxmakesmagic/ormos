This is [Geralf's Mindcrusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geralf%27s+Mindcrusher), a blue rare from *Dark Ascension*.

As you can see in the art, it's a large monster, which explains why it's a 5/5 Zombie Horror. But what about the mindcrushing? What does the art have that explains that? Well, what if you were to learn that Geralf made a creature that's covered with *dozens of tiny eyes*?

Ooh! Creepy! But not creepy *enough*. Let's get an even closer look at that head.

So many eyes! That's enough to crush even the strongest mind.
