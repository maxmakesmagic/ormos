*Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* Draft Gauntlet
---------------------------------------------------


Starting July 14 for a week, we are introducing a new way to play *Magic* on *Magic Online*: Draft Gauntlet!


For those familiar with previous iterations of gauntlets on *Magic Online*, they are a way to play with preconstructed decks that we provide; no deck building necessary! The twist here is that as opposed to being given a deck randomly, you now get choose one. Your deck-building decision will be choosing a class.


![Class Draft Scene](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/tgxLN6WTIw.jpg)


You'll then do battle with other like-minded adventurers wielding any of these twelve core D&D classes in a league-style format. All twelve decklists and full event information will be published soon.

Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend.
