It's Adventure Week, and we're going to get to some of the creative ventures you guys sent in. But first I thought we'd go on a little scavenger hunt.

**Savor the Flavor Scavenger Hunt!**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf81_quest.jpg)  
Answer these five questions by braving an expedition through Savor the Flavor articles since the beginning of *Zendikar* previews. The first one to get all the answers right in this week's forum thread gets a signed copy of *Alara Unbroken* (assuming the old ways of snail-mail connectivity can reach where you live). Let the adventure begin!

1. Which *Worldwake* card was alluded to in the journal of an adventurer, months before the set released?
2. In a discussion of everyday spellcraft, which color did I suggest would have magic useful for spa treatments?
3. Which ancient Greek philosopher did I paraphrase during an early mention of the Roil?
4. Which non-Jace planeswalker shows up in the art of a *Worldwake* card (and which card is it)?
5. What is also known as the City That Walks?

Now on to your creative endeavors. I'm excited about this—you guys really came through.

**Adventurous Expressions**

[Last week](/en/articles/archive/savor-flavor/magic-connected-age-2010-03-03) I asked you to send in examples of your **Magic** passion at work, to show me what creative expressions are made possible by this, our Connected Age. I said I would show off what you sent me in the form of a link-dense Letter of the Week—but I was pleased to find that there was way too much good stuff for that, so the out-shouting will now take the form of an entire article. I encourage you to check out what these creative folks have done. If you're inspired to, go to their sites or Twitter accounts or Facebook pages and give them props. If you're further inspired, draw or build or write or create your own things!

I've broken down the responses I got in the last week into a few categories. They all take the form of what I call *feats of creative expression*. The first is all about visual art, which I'm calling Feats of Light.

**Feats of Light**

Artist and **Magic** fan Tan Zie Aun has some stylin' fan art on his DeviantArt site that you should check out. I'm particularly fond of his Jace.

Onward! Adrian has another Feat of Light, this one a bit more *three-dimensional*.

Amazing stuff, Adrian. Thanks for sharing that!

If I had Feats of Light, you know I had to have ...

**Feats of Sound**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf81_savage.jpg)  
Yep, these are feats of creative expression in the audio realm. We begin with a letter from Chewie:


>  Yo Doug!

> 
> I saw your request for Magic-related creations, and just had to send this in! My name is Chewie, and some friends and I (Brian, Mike, and Dirk) have been doing a casual-centric Magic podcast for almost two and a half years now. It's called The Mana Pool, and we are devoted to the fun of the game. We've covered everything from real-world animal types to multiplayer mayhem to the flavor of Magic mechanics to just whatever else you can think of. Episode 118 is actually uploading as I write this email. You can find us at <http://themanapool.libsyn.com>.

> In case anyone would actually like to know what makes people listen to us, you should check these out first. We have entirely too much fun. One of our listeners put together a bunch of clips set to music when we hit our first year, and he did so again at two years. They really show off why we're worth listening to.

PODCASTS, yes. You can listen to these feats of sound on your portable *magic mouth* while planeswalking through the Blind Eternities sitting on the subway or forming a mana bond waiting in the checkout line.

Fantastic work. Thanks for sending those in, Eric!

Now *this*—this is a feat of sound. Note: the lyrics in some of these MP3s go a little beyond our normal "all-ages" vocabulary here on the site. That means bad words. Click at your own discretion.

But it's not just candy for the ears and eyes today. We've also got candy for your prefrontal cortex (mmm, cortex candy) and your digital devices. Got a deck and a phone?

How it basically works is like correspondence chess: I send a txt message/email/tweet/facebook message to my friend saying, "[Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch), 20/20, pass turn."

Nice! I of course took "boredom in school" to be code for "boredom while taking mass transit to and from my beloved educational institution," as I know you are not actually texting your exalted beatdown *during* *class*.

(I taught a couple philosophy courses when I was a grad student, so as a one-time teacher-kinda, I have to stick up for the poor saps who are trying hard to teach you stuff. Although I'll admit I am just as guilty. I have found deck-building thoughts scribbled and underlined in the margins of my college notes about Kierkegaard. "[Jokulhaups](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jokulhaups) + Phasing?? How about *that* for creating some existential despair! HAHAHA"—and there's a doodle of [Sandbar Crocodile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandbar+Crocodile) eating a little top-hatted Danish man, etc.)

Pay attention in school! And *then* play **Magic** using the invisible space wires.

**Feats of Reflection**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf81_mirrorOfFate.jpg)  
Lastly are what I call feats of reflection—writing, theorizing, composing. The stringing together of words and arguments in a thoughtful manner. A personal fave.

Brendan here has been busy. His historian character Issar Roon spins tales that weave together summaries of the canonical **Magic** storyline with Issar's own crotchety eccentricities.


>  Dear Mr. Beyer,  
>  I've recently begun writing the Issar Roon articles over at Mana Nation. (<http://www.mananation.com/author/issarroon/>) Thanks to Trick, I've been given free reign to do anything I want. I'm attempting to find a balance of my own story-telling (through Issar Roon's situation), and actual Magic lore.

Thanks Brendan! I love seeing how everybody interfaces with flavor in a different way. Some people want to drill down on the storyline, scouring every book and cranny for official lore, treating it as treasured Dominian myth. Others fill in the gaps with entirely new stories and characters. The quilt has plenty of room for everybody.

Daniel has been working on a personality quiz based on the color pie—but one that's a little more in-depth than some of the quizzes out there.

Hey Daniel, you sound far from lazy! You've done a ton of work already. You should definitely put together a web page for this somewhere, so others could take your test. I'm certainly interested to see what my results would be.

Martin here has a series of blog posts about **Magic** in a context of religious studies. Fascinating stuff.

I'm comfortable calling **Magic** a "ritual system." Historically there's plenty of overlap between the fantasy genre, legends of magic and spellcasters, the writings of medieval philosophers and scientists, and religious thought.

The next creator's project has an aspect of tantalizing mystery to it. The author revealed his or her Twitter username to me, but I've gone ahead and snipped it out of a few spots of the person's email so as to leave the author anonymous, in case he or she wants to keep it that way for now.

> Doug, I've been a player of Magic for a long time now, and having graduated from college, but still having a hard time finding work, I have had a lot of time to tinker with my long time interest in Magic. I have recently begun writing articles and I hope to do a lot more Magic writing. One project that I have begun I think you would be particularly interested in, and I'd like your advice in regards to how to move forward with it.

I tell you this in a kind of confidence as I have not told anyone yet and I'm not sure I want the community at large to know, but I am the author behind the user @Rivnix (<http://twitter.com/Rivnix>).

During a mishap, his spark ignited and brought him to relative safety on Zendikar, which is where the Twitter timeline begins.

An amazing project, isn't it? This is exactly what I mean by "**Magic** in the Connected Age." New media mean new artistic expressions. New artistic expressions mean new ways of being part of the worlds of **Magic** and new ways of making its worlds part of you. I urge you to go ahead and check out Rivnix's 140-character adventures on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/Rivnix) (note that you don't need a Twitter account to read it). Remember that Twitter puts the most recent tweets at the top, so read from the bottom!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf81_boilerworks.jpg)  
The author here goes on to ask what steps to take in order to keep Rivnix's tale consistent with **Magic**'s ongoing storyline. That can be tough, my name-withheld friend, seeing as how we work on it all hush-hush-like and how there's a long time delay between when we're actively working on a setting and when it's released to the public. But I would advise you (and anyone looking to spin tales of **Magic**) to keep on checking the web comics, novels, Planeswalker's Guides, Savor the Flavor, and other sources of storyline—those are all our story venues, so if you can stay abreast of those then you've kept consistent. Truth is, there are plenty of intentional holes left in the quilt of **Magic** story, plenty of gaps made available for you to patch in your own stories. 

There were many more emails, and I'm sorry I couldn't print them all. I encourage you all to continue perpetrating feats of creative expression. Without your imaginative interaction, **Magic** would never have exploded into the phenomenon it's become.
