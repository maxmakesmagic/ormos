When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he wanted a job making Magic cards. Ten years later, his dream was realized as his combined success as a professional player, deck builder, and writer brought him into Wizards R&D during 2011. He's been writing Magic articles since 2005 and has no plans to stop. 





This week, we aren't only going to do something weird. We're going to do something Weird. Strap yourself in. It's time for some Izzet experimentation!
