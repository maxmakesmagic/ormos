Tomoharu Saito is the Grand Prix–Singapore champion! The 2007 Player of the Year used Naya Zoo to take the championship title, conquering the Extended format for at least one weekend. Of course, you don't have to take Decks of the Week's word for it. Check out all the details from the event [in the official event coverage](/en/events/coverage/saito-slaughters-singapore).


The Pro Tour Qualifier–Honolulu season is winding to a close with just a few weeks to go. The Pro Tour host city had its very own PTQ, sending in Top 8 lists for all to share. Make sure to check out Albuquerque, back-to-back events from Roanoke, Winnipeg, and more! If you're looking for a PTQ near you, check out [the official PTQ schedule](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/honolulu09-qualifiers).


There were a ton of Premier Event Top 8s this week as well, spread across Extended, Classic, Standard, and *Shards of Alara* Block Constructed. And if you haven't heard, it's Customer Appreciation Week on **Magic Online**. If you haven't taken advantage of that fact, what are you waiting for? See what cool things are in store by [reading the official announcement](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/032309a).
