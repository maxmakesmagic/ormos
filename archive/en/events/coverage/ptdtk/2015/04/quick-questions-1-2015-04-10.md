**Jacob Wilson, No. 12 Ranked Player:** [Atarka Beastbreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka+Beastbreaker). This looked like a great card for beatdown strategies, and an early drop that could be powerful later, but it turns out that it's nothing exciting.

**Shahar Shenhar, No. 7 Ranked Player:** All of the dragonlords. They look fantastic, and they are somehow so much better. Each one of them feels like it's game over.
