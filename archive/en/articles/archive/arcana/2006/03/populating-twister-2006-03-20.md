Boon to booster-cracking Limited players everywhere, the *Mirage* reprint [Savage Twister](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Twister) has found a new home in *Guildpact* aligned with the Gruul guild. The card got new art for its *Guildpact* printing to reflect the Ravnica setting, starting with this initial sketch by Luca Zontini:

We definitely have a wrecking-ball of a twister here, savagely destroying a Ravnica district. But this spell kills creatures, not lands -- so Luca was asked to add in some people getting menaced by the twister.

Here's a second look. Oh, how easy it is for a citizen of Ravnica to get into mortal danger -- all it takes is for someone on the creative team to say, "Needs more people." Actually, even after this sketch, the number of people wasn't considered to be enough. Remember that, in gameplay, this spell routinely wipes the board clean, or leaves behind only the beefiest and sturdiest of beasts. 

Let's take a look at the final art.

Now *that* is a savage twister. Run, little Ravnican citizens, run!
