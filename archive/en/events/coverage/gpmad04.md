Live Coverage of 2004 Grand Prix Madrid
=======================================












![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmad04/gpmad04_champ.jpg) 2,400 US dollars. 1,352 registered opponents. 31 hours of regulation play. 6 pro points. 5 hours of sleep. 2 days. 1 undeniable champion. This weekend Kai Budde showed the talent that has put him at the top of the list of money earners in Pro Magic history. Finishing in 27th place yesterday, he annihilated all that would stand in his way and claimed the title of tournament Champion for himself.


The biggest Grand Prix ever has a fitting ending. What began with a record attendance ended with a record breaking finish, now setting Kai's bar at a whopping seven Grand Prix victories.

Bernardo Cabral had the feared [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) and the frustrating [Crystal Shard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystal+Shard), but even his deck was no match for the Juggernaut who was playing a fast white/red beatdown with the game-breaking [Grab the Reins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins).

Congratulations to Kai Budde, the Grand Prix Madrid 2004 Champion!
