Burn. A strategy as old as *Magic* itself. Even back in Alpha, players were assembling enough red direct-damage spells to finish off opponents without using the attack step. If you assemble enough [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s and [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)s, you don't really need to attack. While the cards have changed, the underlying strategy has not. Burn is a viable strategy at all levels of play.

Rahman Aryabhima proved this at his WMCQ in Japan, taking home a coveted invitation to his country's World *Magic* Cup team. One by one, he burned his way past his opponents with a Burn deck that has slowly gotten stronger over the course of the year. Burn decks are generally critical mass decksâ€”they need a large amount of strong burn spells to be effective. Quantity is often more important than quality when it comes to Burn decks.


There are a whopping 27 instants capable of dealing damage directly to the opponent, which allows the deck to unleash burn spells at exactly the right opportunity. The creatures in the deck support these instant burn spells very well. [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) churns out tokens with each burn spell, while [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) doesn't stay down for long. Finally, [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel) will put lots of pressure on both players' life totals such that the burn spells will finish the game.


Congratulations to Rahman for winning the Japanese WMCQ! If you want to qualify for your national team, check out  [the World *Magic* Cup Qualifier list](http://magic.wizards.com/en/wmcq/schedule) .
