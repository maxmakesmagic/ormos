The topic at hand is how different artifacts should be from enchantments.


One side is arguing that the two are currently too close. Every other card type is clearly delineated from each other. Too often cards get created that could simply be either an artifact or an enchantment. We should do more to separate them.


The other side says that the difference between them shouldn’t be mechanical but flavor. It’s okay that they work very similarly mechanically. Just separate them with flavor.


This is the kind of thing that happens in R&D all the time. Some random topic comes out and whoever is around jumps in with his or her two cents.
