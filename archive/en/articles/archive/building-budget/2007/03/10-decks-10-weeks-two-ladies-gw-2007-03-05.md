Hey everyone, and welcome to Building on a Budget. This week we’re going to embark on an ambitious deckbuilding experiment called 10 Decks in 10 Weeks.

Here’s how it’s going to work: There are a lot of cards in *Time Spiral* and *Planar Chaos* that look like a lot of fun to build around. Each week, I’m going to start with a concept and a two-color combination, and build that deck. For instance, this week’s article centers around one of the new “timeshifted” cards in *Planar Chaos*, [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress). By the end of this article, we’ll have a fully modified Enchantress deck.


Here’s where the fun part kicks in! Deckbuilding is an organic process. When you buy packs or singles, or trade for cards, you own them. If I build an Enchantress deck, the cards in this deck don’t just disappear when I decide to play a red/white Boros deck the next week – they simply are filed away in my collection. For 10 Decks in 10 Weeks, the starting point for each successive week’s deck will be the cards in one of the colors from the deck the week previous! This week’s deck is a green-white Enchantress deck. At the start of next week’s article, I’ll keep the green from this deck, ditch the white, and use that as a starting point for a green-red [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) deck! (Foreshadowing!) At the start of the week after that, we’ll keep the red and start work on a red-blue [Aeon Chronicler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler) deck, and so on and so forth, until all ten color combinations have been covered!  
![Evolution_Charm](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/PLC/Evolution_Charm.jpg) One of the problems with soliciting reader feedback for Building on a Budget has been the inability to incorporate suggestions into current builds, due to the deadline between when my articles go up and when I have to get the next week’s article to Kelly Digges, our omnipotent and all-powerful editor. The great part about 10 Decks in 10 Weeks is that I can poll weeks ahead of time, and 100% do what you, the readers, want! So my homework assignment for this week is as follows:


I’ve just finished doing a green-white Enchantress deck, a green-red [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) deck, and a red-blue [Aeon Chronicler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler) deck. Which color combination and card/concept would you like to see next? Remember: Deck #4 must contain either red or blue, and can’t be a repeat of a previous color combination. Give your suggestions in the forums or via e-mail (use the link at the bottom of this page!), and one of these suggestions will be the basis for Deck #4 of 10!


I’m pretty excited about 10 Decks in 10 Weeks, and I’m definitely happy with the first deck of the bunch: The Two Ladies.

The title of this article, “The Two Ladies,” refers to the two Enchantresses in Standard right now – [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress) and [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress). Traditionally, strategies built around [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress) have been weak. There have been very successful Enchantress builds in the past, but they were centered around Argothian Enchantress (an untargetable, two-mana creature) and Enchantress’s Presence (an enchantment itself). [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress) has *never* been out of print (it’s been in Alpha, Beta, *Unlimited*, *Revised*, *Fourth*, *Fifth*, *Sixth*, *Seventh*, *Eighth*, and *Ninth* Editions), but has never been the center of a successful deck without the help of one of the two aforementioned Enchantress cards. Why is that? Let me run down the reasons:


1) [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress) is a 0/2 creature for three mana. While this in and of itself isn’t a deal breaker, it makes it essentially a dead card on the board without support. It’s also extremely vulnerable to creature kill – Argothian Enchantress was untargetable, which made it successful. [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress) dies to a single [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) or [Seal of Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire), not to mention [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp), [Sunlance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunlance) (not applicable for [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress)!), [Volcanic Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer), or the such.


2) At most times, there has been only one Enchantress-type card available for play. It’s tough to build a deck around a single card when you have about as much chance of not seeing that card as seeing it – especially when it dies quickly in most games you *do* see it!


![Mesa_Enchantress](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/PLC/Mesa_Enchantress.jpg) 3) Most enchantments won’t win you the game on their own. If it’s an Aura – Enchant Creature, you need creatures to put the enchantments on. If it’s a non-Aura enchantment, you need it to do something on its own – such as deal damage ([Stormbind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbind), [Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium)), turn your lands into creatures ([Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb), Living Lands), or the somesuch. If you’re playing [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress), you need to devote a large amount of space in your deck to having enchantments – otherwise, why play her? But at the same time, having large amounts of enchantments means having fewer win conditions – and [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress) herself has a hard time killing people. 


Now that [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress) is around, problem #2 is solved – eight Enchantresses means a much more consistent strategy. You have twice as much chance of seeing an Enchantress in any given game and a much higher rate of seeing them in multiples. The only problem is that these Enchantresses are both double-colored, and you want to be able to drop them on turn three, if you draw one in your opening hand.


To combat this problem, I decided to use [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl) as my mana-accelerant of choice in The Two Ladies. There is a diversity of one-drop mana accelerators in Standard right now, including [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Elves of Deep Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elves+of+Deep+Shadow), [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), and [Boreal Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid). Each has their advantages and disadvantages, but in this case we’re playing an Enchantress deck – why wouldn’t we want to play [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl)?


It’s also the second-best suited of the five cards for getting either double-green or double-white on turn two, behind the decidedly non-budget [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). Let’s imagine that it’s your first turn and you’ve got a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), a [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress), and one of these one-mana accelerators in hand. Here’s how your game plays out:


[Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves): Turn one [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). Turn two: No double-white.  
[Boreal Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid): Turn one [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Boreal Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid), see above!  
[Elves of Deep Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elves+of+Deep+Shadow): More of the same.  
[Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl): Turn one [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl) naming white. Turn two [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress).


So at this point, we have twelve cards for the deck – the eight Enchantresses and the four [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl)s. Let’s solve problem #3 – the need to have both threats and enchantments in the deck, at a critical mass. In *Time Spiral*, there were several enchantments that return to your hand if they go to the graveyard from play. In white and green, these are [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop) and [Aspect of Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Mongoose), respectively. But how do I ensure sending these two enchantments to the graveyard for recursion?



![Auratog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Auratog)

Enter [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) and [Gatherer of Graces](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatherer+of+Graces). Each of these creatures thrives off of enchantments – the Gatherer by being enchanted, and [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) by eating them! Both have abilities which let me sacrifice an enchantment at no mana cost, which is ideal for recurring [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop) and [Aspect of Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Mongoose). With an Enchantresses and a [Gatherer of Graces](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatherer+of+Graces) in play, each [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop) reads “![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/Symbols/white_mana.gif) : Draw a card.” With an [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), it reads “![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/Symbols/white_mana.gif) : [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) gets +2/+2. Draw a card.” This makes [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) a very viable kill condition for this deck, which again solves problem #3 – a kill condition that also doubles as the deck’s engine! [Aspect of Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Mongoose) helps out with problem #1 – fragile Enchantresses. An untargetable Enchantress is an Enchantress that is much, much harder to deal with.

To round out the deck, I wanted to add enchantment-based removal. White has an abundance of these, most of which are variations on [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism). After consulting with Gatherer for choices, I decided to go with [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) and [Faith’s Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%E2%80%99s+Fetters). [Faith’s Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%E2%80%99s+Fetters) is one of the best removal spells printed in recent memory, because it can not only just about deal with anything, but it gains you life in the process, which buys you time and tempo.


My other choice, [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation), was inspired by [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog). Most people are not playing with shadow creatures, which means that if I have a creature with shadow, it’s essentially unblockable. One of the problems with [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) is that it does not have any sort of built-in evasion, such as flying or trample. My opponents can simply chump-block it all day long. With [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation), I have a creature-removal spell that can also double as a win condition! If I put [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) on [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), I can swing past all my opponent’s defending creatures, wait until blockers are (not) declared, and then sacrifice [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) to [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) before damage is put on the stack, allowing it to become huge.


The last nonland card I put in the deck was [Seal of Primordium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium), as a catch-all solution to enchantments and artifacts. It combos with [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress) and [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress), so it’s advisable in this particular deck over alternatives such as [Disenchant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant) or [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize).


 



![Verduran Enchantress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Verduran+Enchantress)

For a mana base, I went with an even split between [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s, [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), and a full complement of [Selesnya Sanctuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Sanctuary). The color breakdown of cards is pretty even (even symmetrical: Mesa and [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress), [Gatherer of Graces](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatherer+of+Graces) and [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), [Aspect of Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Mongoose) and [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop), [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) and [Seal of Primordium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium)), and the mana cost of this deck tops out at four (with only twelve cards costing more than two), so 22 lands total with 4 [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl) seems sufficient.

Game 1: Darkher0 (B/R Rakdos)  

This is not an auspicious beginning, as I draw a hand with three [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s and all White cards. I decide to keep it, and end up dead six turns later to [Rakdos Pit Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Pit+Dragon) and [Jagged Poppet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jagged+Poppet), having never drawn a single spell I could play all game.  

Record: 0-1


People ask why I include games like this in my articles, considering they are one-sided blowouts. Well, there’s a lot to learn from these types of games! If getting shorted on colors happens often, do I need to fix the mana base of the deck? If this happens to my opponent, is my deck fast enough to be able to take advantage of their slow start, or do they have time to draw into their colors and stabilize? Given what I did see during that game, would my deck have been able to win *had* I drawn my colors? Even though this game lasted six turns and I never drew a spell, I started taking notes for building my deck – I might need to fix the mana, and I would have had a chance if I had drawn a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) (I had two [Faith’s Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%E2%80%99s+Fetters) and a [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) in hand), so the problem was definitely the mana and not the spells.


Game 2; Armstrong36 (G/U Simic)  

This was the first game in which the deck hummed. I got a first turn [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl), which led to a turn-two [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress), turn-three [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress), and turn-four [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) with [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop). This enabled me to start giving [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) +6/+6 on turn five while drawing seven cards a turn (my regular draw plus recurring [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop) three times), which Armstrong36 could not keep up with. Eventually I drew [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) and came in with [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) for the win.  

Record: 1-1


After just two games, I realized I needed at least something that could turn my Enchantresses into offensive creatures. The natural solution for this was a card that just missed the cut in my initial build: [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak). [Molder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder)vine Clock turns any 0/2 creature into a respectable 3/5 beatstick. It is also dredgable, which means that if I do not have an enchantment in hand, but have an Enchantress or two on the board, I can bring back [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) and be assured of moving my Enchantress draw-engine forward!

Out: [Aspect of Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Mongoose), 2 [Gatherer of Graces](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatherer+of+Graces)  

In: 3 [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak)


Game 3: *Odyssey*man (Slivers)  

He gets [Gemhide Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemhide+Sliver) and then [Firewake Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firewake+Sliver). I get Gatherer of Grace and put [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop) on it, then [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl) a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). This lets me drop [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) and [Aspect of Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Mongoose), and I hit him for 11 with the [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), dropping him to 8 (he took a hit from the Gatherer) and bringing me to over 30 life thanks to [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop). He’s built up a couple of more Slivers (Spinneret and [Might Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+Sliver)), but I have [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) in hand, and I’m all primed to kill him the next turn. Unfortunately for me, this is when he drops [Essence Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Sliver) and then beats the poo out of me for 19! Talk about a turn-around – suddenly I’m facing down a horde of 4/4 [Spirit Link](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Link)ed Slivers, and I have no chance of pouring enough damage in to swing for that much life in a single turn at this point. The next turn he drops [Two-Headed Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Two-Headed+Sliver), and within another turn I’m dead to [Might Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+Sliver) number two.  

Record: 1-2


 



![Moldervine Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Moldervine+Cloak)

Game 4: Anon (Boros)  

Just to note: this opponent’s screen name is actually Anon – this is not someone who I am keeping anonymous! He gets double [Boros Recruit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Recruit). But I shut them down with one of each Enchantress (how often do I get to say that?). He drops [Boros Swiftblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Swiftblade), and I drop a third Enchantress and a [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl), refilling my hand (take that, [Harmonize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harmonize)!). He gets down [Skyknight Legionnaire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyknight+Legionnaire) and beats me for 4, but I put double [Molder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder)vine cloak on my Enchantresses, draw six cards, and attack for 6. He swings again, and I play [Faith’s Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%E2%80%99s+Fetters) on his Skyknight, draw three cards and gain 4 life, and swing in for another six. He drops [Icatian Crier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icatian+Crier), and I drop another [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) on my Enchantress (making it a 9/11), play [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) on it, and then drop [Seal of Primordium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium) so I can swing past his guys, destroy my own Isolation with Seal, and hit him for lethal damage.  

Record: 2-2
Game 5: Taluuke (G/R Haste)  

I get turn-one [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl) for white, which leads to turn-two and -three [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress)es. He gets [Primal Forcemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Forcemage), and I throw [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) on it to draw two cards. He answers with a 7/4 [Giant Solifuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Solifuge), dropping me to thirteen. I get [Gatherer of Graces](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatherer+of+Graces) and put [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) on an Enchantress, allowing me to swing back for 3. He swings in with his Solifuge, and I block with my Gatherer, wait for damage to stack, and then sacrifice the [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) on his Forcemage to regenerate my 1/2 guy. Remember – while [Gatherer of Graces](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatherer+of+Graces) only gets a bonus while enchanted by an aura, you can still sacrifice *any* aura you control to regenerate it!


He drops a second [Primal Forcemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Forcemage), and I hit that one with [Faith’s Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%E2%80%99s+Fetters) and then drop a third Enchantress. He plays a second [Giant Solifuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Solifuge), and that one comes across for a whopping 10 damage, bringing me to 3 life. I don’t have an enchantment in hand, so I sacrifice [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) at the end of Taluuke’s turn to my [Gatherer of Graces](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatherer+of+Graces) and then dredge it so I can be assured of drawing three cards (triple Enchantress) instead of one card (an unknown). This nets me two lands and an [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), but luckily Taluuke has no haste creatures to drop the following turn. This allows me to resacrifice and redrege, this time netting [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) and [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop), allowing me to come in for lethal damage with [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog).  

Record: 3-2


 



![Faiths Fetters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Faiths+Fetters)

Game 6: Edgewood Dirk (B/W Aggro)  

He gets turn-two [Veteran Armorer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Armorer), turn-three [Unholy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy+Strength), turn-four [Nightguard Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightguard+Patrol) plus [Holy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Holy+Strength). Before you know it, I’m down to four life (eight, but he accidentally misclicked on the [Veteran Armorer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Armorer) on one attack, which missed four damage that I otherwise would have taken). I do stick two Enchantresses to the board, and then start taking out his creatures with [Faith’s Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%E2%80%99s+Fetters) and [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation), both of which are insane when you attach Inspiration to their normal effects! He drops [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp), but I get [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) and a third Enchantress and put [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop) on the [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog). After a [Faith’s Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%E2%80%99s+Fetters) on his [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp), Edgewood Dirk is reduced to chump-blocking my [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), while I draw thirteen cards a turn looking for a second [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation). I find it the following turn and finish off the game.  

Record: 4-2
Out of the 15 games I played this week, this next one was probably the closest, hardest match of them all. I’ll let the play-by-play of this match speak for itself.


Game 7: T\_COLLINS (R/G Land Destruction)

His turn 5: Gargadon (6), [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain)[Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) with [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl) (Frown!), [Gruul Turf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Turf)  

Turn 6: [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog)  

His Turn 6: Gargadon (5), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)  

Turn 7: [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop) on [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress), [Selesnya Sanctuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Sanctuary), swing – he blocks with Solifuge, and sacrifices it to the Gargadon (4) so I don’t gain life.  

His turn 7: Gargadon (3), Skargg, the Rage Pits, sacrifice [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to play Gargadon, hit it with Skargg, swing for 10 (3-20). [Kird Ape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape).  

Turn 8: Second [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) on the Enchantress, second [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop) on the Enchantress, swing. He blocks with [Kird Ape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape), but I gain 12 (15-20).  

His turn 8: Swing with Gargadon, give it +1/+1 (5-20), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)  

Turn 9: [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl) on [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), second [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress), swing for 6 (gain 12) (17-14).  

His turn 9: Pass.  

Turn 10: [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) on [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), move both [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop)s onto him, swing for lethal.  

Record: 5-2


This game is a perfect example of why you should never give up when you’re playing a match. It’s not over until your opponent kills you (or locks you down with Mindslaver and [Academy Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins)), so even if you’re at 1 life facing down lethal damage there’s always a chance you can draw/play what you need to mount a comeback!


 



![Fortune Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fortune+Thief)

Game 8: Ctirpak2003 (5 Color Control)  

He gets stuck on three mana, and drops a morph. I get a quick draw with double Enchantress, [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) and [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop), and he is forced to chump block my [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) with his morph – which ends up being [Fortune Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortune+Thief), a creature to which my deck has no answer! Thankfully he never had double red or I would have just plain lost outright. However, since he’s stuck at three mana, I get to kill him in a hurry.  

Record: 6-2
You may notice that my killing comes from either [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) or [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) in most of the above game logs. At this point I’d realized that [Gatherer of Graces](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatherer+of+Graces), while decent in theory as a sacrifice outlet, just wasn’t cutting the mustard at all. Out it went.


One of the problems I was facing with my Enchantress deck, believe it or not, was drawing *too many* cards! There frequently were turns where I was drawing 13-19 cards a turn, and ended up having to discard a majority of my hand (how often do I get to say that, when it doesn’t involve an opponent’s discard spell?) at the end of my turn. Was there a way to capitalize on this? There sure was!


Enter [Retether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retether). [Retether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retether) puts Creature-based Auras directly into play, which means it won’t trigger Enchantresses. However, if I’m discarding 6-7 Enchantments at the end of my turn, why not bring them all back at once on [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), assuring one quick, fatal strike? It also lets me get double-pump out of the enchantments on the board. If my [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) is enchanted by [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak), and my opponent’s creature is enchanted with [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) and another with [Faith’s Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%E2%80%99s+Fetters), I can sacrifice all three to give [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) +6/+6, cast [Retether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retether), put the Cloak back on [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) (+9/+9), gain four more life, and swing again, sacrificing the two defensive enchantments after blockers are declared to give [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) +13/+13 total, just off of three enchantments!

In: 3 [Retether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retether)


Game 9: cp70 (B/W Pauper CIP deck)  

He gets [Ravenous Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Rats), [Whitemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitemane+Lion), [Aven Riftwatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher), and [Shrieking Grotesque](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrieking+Grotesque). I get [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress) (which is [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp)ed), and then [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) with [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak). He throws [Pillory of the Sleepless](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillory+of+the+Sleepless) on my [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), but I answer with two Enchantresses and then sacrifice my Cloak to the [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) to dredge like crazy. As my life slowly drops down I get a second [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) to the board. I then sacrifice [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) to give [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) +2/+2 during my upkeep, dredge it, play it on my ‘Tog again, sacrifice it again (+4/+4), and play [Retether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retether), getting back double [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation), [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak), and [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop). Play [Seal of Primordium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium), attack. After no blockers, I have [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) (+7/+7), I sacrifice both Isolations and the [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop)s (+13/+13), double [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl) (+17/+17) and the [Seal of Primordium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium) (+19/+19) to deal 20 damage in one turn with [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog). Ka-Pow!  

Record: 7-2


 



![Norin the Wary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Norin+the+Wary)

Game 10: eaglescout16 ([Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium))  

He gets turn-one [Norin the Wary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norin+the+Wary), turn-three [Primal Forcemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Forcemage), and turn-four [Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium). I drop [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) with [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak), but he plays a spell to blink Norin, killing my [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) (Norin comes into play at a 5/4 creature). He then plays another Norin, blinking the first and dealing 5 damage to me. He swings with [Primal Forcemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Forcemage), [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink)s it, and then almost hits me for 10 with the other two Norins, except for a misclick that stacked [Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium) before [Primal Forcemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Forcemage), leaving me at two life. However, I draw nothing on my next draw step, and die.  

Record: 7-3
Game 11: Kwisatz\_Haderch (U/G/B Control)  

He gets double [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and [Scryb Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger). I get [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), and put [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) on it, and then start going nuts with [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop). He uses [Stonewood Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonewood+Invocation) to try to block with a [Scryb Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger), but my ‘Tog gets much bigger thanks to [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl) and [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak). I sacrifice [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) to try to dredge, but he plays [Extirpate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate) on my Cloak, removing it and all other copies in my deck from the game. This allows me to go nuts with [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop), and after I draw a second ‘Tog, he’s reduced to chump blocking both of my creatures each turn to stay alive. Eventually he runs out of creatures and dies.  

Record: 8-3


Game 12: PlaytheShovels (U/R Wizards)  

He gets down two morphs. I [Faith’s Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%E2%80%99s+Fetters) the first, but the second is a [Willbender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Willbender), sending my [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) at my own Enchantress. I play another Isolation, then an [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog). I try to [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak), but he flips another [Willbender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Willbender), making his guy a 4/5 creature that can’t deal damage! He then plays Teferi, but I start going nuts with [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) and [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop). Eventually he gets [Wipe Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wipe+Away), but I draw [Aspect of Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Mongoose) and continue my [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) shenanigans. When he taps down to a single blue to drop and morph a [Willbender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Willbender) at instant speed, I sacrifice all the enchantments on the board to give [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) +14/+14 and play [Retether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retether) for the win.  

Record: 9-3


Even though I’ve found one way to use 17 cards in hand, I still want more. I decide to add a third color to the deck, red, to take advantage of [Stormbind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbind). [Stormbind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbind) is another enchantment that can trigger an Enchantress, but it also solves my problem of not being able to kill any creatures. With an [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) and an Enchantress on the board, I can play [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop), draw a card, discard a card to deal two damage, sacrifice [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop), replay it, draw a card, and deal two more damage. With multiple Enchantresses, I can deal even more damage. This gives me a solution to pesky utility creatures (read: [Fortune Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortune+Thief)) while also giving me more game against Aggro decks.


To make room for the [Stormbind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbind)s, I take out the [Seal of Primordium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium)s. They haven’t been too useful in playtesting, so they were the natural cut. I also add four red mana sources, which combined with the four [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl)s, should be enough to cast [Stormbind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbind).

Game 13: KUSHLORD (U/W Control)  

We both end up stuck short on mana and discarding, but I break out of it first by drawing a second [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and dropping double [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress). All the time, I’d been discarding [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak)s and [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop)s, and he concedes when I play [Retether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retether) to make a pair of 3/5 [Spirit Link](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Link)ed creatures against his empty board.  

Record: 10-3


 



![Stormbind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stormbind)

Game 14: Centuryman1979 (Mono-B Beatdown)  

He drops an early [Festering Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin) and follows with [Dauthi Slayer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauthi+Slayer) and [Sangrophage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sangrophage). I hit the [Sangrophage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sangrophage) with [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) and the [Dauthi Slayer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauthi+Slayer) with [Faith’s Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%E2%80%99s+Fetters), then draw into [Stormbind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbind). He drops [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk), making it difficult to work my [Stormbind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbind) to kill his guy! He compounds the issue with a [Plague Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Sliver). I eventually work around to clearing his board with a second [Faith’s Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%E2%80%99s+Fetters) and the [Stormbind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbind), but this leaves me with no cards in hand. He then drops a second [Plague Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Sliver) and a [Nether Traitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Traitor), and he beats me down to zero over two turns.  

Record: 10-4
Game 15: Flinxie (U/G Aggro)  

I get double Enchantress and [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), and quickly start swinging for seven cards and 7 damage a turn. I draw [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) within a couple of turns, and finish him off quickly.  

Record: 11-4


Quick tips about The Two Ladies:  

1) Remember that both [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress) and [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress) trigger when you play an enchantment spell. This means that even if your enchantment is countered, you will draw a card! By the same token, you need to play the enchantment to draw a card – if you cheat the enchantment directly into play using [Retether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retether), you will not draw cards for the enchantments being brought directly into play from your graveyard.


 



![Retether](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Retether)

2) The enchantments returned by [Retether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retether) do not target when they are returned to play. This means that if you have two [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak)s in your graveyard, and you cast [Retether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retether), you can put those Cloaks on a creature that is already enchanted by [Aspect of Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Mongoose)! Similarly, remember that [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) can eat [Aspect of Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Mongoose) and have it come back – so if you need to re-enchant a creature that already has [Aspect of Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Mongoose) on it, you can make the Aspect go away for a second, and then plop it back on.

3) Both [Aspect of Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Mongoose) and [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop) go to the graveyard before returning to your hand. This means when their return-to-hand ability triggers, your opponent has an opportunity to remove these enchantments from the game. Watch out for [Extirpate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate) and [Tormod’s Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%E2%80%99s+Crypt)!


4) Each instance of drawing a card from an Enchantress is resolved one at a time. So let’s say that you have three Enchantresses in play, and cast [Aspect of Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Mongoose). All three Enchantresses will trigger, and you will draw one card, have a chance add abilities/spells to the stack (if they are instant speed), draw the second card, have a chance to add abilities/spells to the stack (if they are instant speed), and then draw the third card. This is important if you are short on enchantments, and need to dredge [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) (this came up several times in my playtesting). If you have [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) and [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) in play, you can draw your first couple of cards with Enchantresses, see if you get an enchantment, and if not, sacrifice the [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) and dredge it so you can have another enchantment in hand!


Before we go on to next week, here’s a new poll, and the result of the last three polls. See you next week for part two of 10 Decks in 10 Weeks, with red-green [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair)!


**Question: What do you think about 10 Decks in 10 Weeks?**Answer #1: I love it! This is what Building on a Budget should be about!Answer #2: I’m undecided at this time. I’ll let you know once I see a couple more parts.Answer #3: I hate it! This is the worst thing to ever happen to Building on a Budget!
