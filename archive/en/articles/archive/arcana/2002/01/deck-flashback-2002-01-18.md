In honor of France's Farid Meranghi winning [Pro Tour - San Diego](http://archive.wizards.com/sideboard//event.asp?event=PTSD02), we present a real blast from the past.

France's Bertrand Lestree piloted a green/white [Erhnam Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erhnam+Djinn)/[Armageddon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) deck to a second-place finish in the very first Pro Tour in 1996, back in the day when [Black Vise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Vise) and [Balance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance) were legal in Type 2 tournaments. Here is his actual decklist:

It took six years for Meranghi to avenge Lestree's loss and finally capture a Pro Tour title for France.
