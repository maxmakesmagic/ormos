*What was the first deck you ever built, and how did it work?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_MonsJohnson.jpg)**Mons Johnson:** The very first deck I built was centered on [Ley Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ley+Druid). Besides the 4 or 5 [Ley Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ley+Druid)s it had [Instill Energy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Instill+Energy), [Wild Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Growth), [Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis), [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon), [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), my one precious [Time Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk), some other random green cards (maybe even a [Craw Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm)), and an [Ornithoper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithoper) or two. As this was soon after *Antiquities*, they weren't the most efficient creatures available, I had to make do with what was around. The concept was for [Ley Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ley+Druid) to tap for one or more mana, either accelerating me into more powerful spells and/or keeping the [Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis) going. [Instill Energy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Instill+Energy) would occasionally win a game by enchanting an attacker while [Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis) held everything for a couple turns.

I learned from building and playing my first deck that building decks is FUN! I should have also learned not to put all my eggs in one basket as a single [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) or [Swords to Plowshares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) could wreck several turns of work, but that lesson wouldn't take till many other decks were built and played ....
