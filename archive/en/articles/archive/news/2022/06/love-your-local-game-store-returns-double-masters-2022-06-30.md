========================================

Beginning July 1, you can claim a foil retro frame promo [Sol Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring) when you spend $50 US on *Magic: The Gathering* sealed products at [your local WPN game store](https://locator.wizards.com/)!

You can take advantage of this promotion more than once, but only one promo card per customer per day, so you'll have to return on a different day and spend $50 to claim additional promo cards. Supplies of the promo card are limited, and they'll only be available while supplies last. Event entry fees do not count toward this promotion.


*Double Masters 2022* Release Events
====================================
