*Time**Spiral's* [Assassinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) card was obviously modeled and named after the ability of [Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin)—destroying a tapped creature.



![Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Royal+Assassin)

Now with the two cards both in *Tenth Edition* together, you can see how close the connection was. The victim in the art of [Assassinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) was designed to represent a victim of Mark Zug's *Eighth Edition* [Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin) in particular.


Note how, in [Assassinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate)'s art, the black ichor dripping from the victim's mouth and leaking into his eye socket resembles [Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin)'s identity-obscuring makeup. And the dagger stabbed into the victim's gut is the same as the one that [Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin) is drawing from under his cloak.
