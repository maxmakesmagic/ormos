Hhere's the art description that was given to [Stephan Martiniere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Stephan+Martiniere%22%5D) for [Phyrexian Rager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Rager).

Because the world had already seen a [Phyrexian Rager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Rager) in *Apocalypse*, there was an art reference for Stephan to work from. Here's what the original rager looked like.

### *Mirrodin Besieged*

Stephan's version focused more on the rager and didn't include a victim. It still seems pretty menacing, don't you think?
