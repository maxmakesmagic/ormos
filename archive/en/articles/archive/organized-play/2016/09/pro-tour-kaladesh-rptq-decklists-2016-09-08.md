Hey everyone! With the [2016 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2016wc/) now behind us, and *Kaladesh* coming up, I'm going to keep today's Organized Play a bit brief so you can go back to looking at today's preview cards. Then I'll be taking a week off, and we'll be resuming with your regularly scheduled OP articles on September 22.


Pro Tour *Kaladesh* RPTQ Top 8 Decklists
========================================


We have a few sets of Top 8 decklists for you today from the Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers (RPTQs) that took place on August 21 and August 29. The Top 4 players from each of these RPTQs earned themselves invitations and airfare to compete in [Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptkld), which takes place October 14–16 in Honolulu, Hawaii.


Every player who participated in an RPTQ during August's rounds received this program-exclusive deck box.

And the Top 16 players from these RPTQs also received a program-exclusive playmat, featuring the *Kaladesh* key art with Saheeli Rai.
