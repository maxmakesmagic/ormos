Anteri Strikes Gold in Manchester
=================================












GRAND PRIX MANCHESTER 2014
--------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/events/2014/gpman14/d2_closing.jpg)The stars of Nyx shone brightly for Fabrizio Anteri here at Grand Prix in Manchester as the Venezuelan claimed his second Grand Prix trophy in three weeks. With previous Top 8s at Grand Prix in Warsaw, Antwerp, and London, where he is currently living, Anteri had already established himself as one of the household names on the European circuit; now he's firmly enshrined in the pantheon of back-to-back Grand Prix winners.


The format this weekend has been *Theros* Block Constructed, and while Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* had certainly set the stage for this Grand Prix, players yet managed to come up with new and exciting ideas. Some combined [Dictate of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+Kruphix) and [Scourge of Fleets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+of+Fleets) to create a wholly new deck, others added more [Ajani, Mentor of Heroes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Mentor+of+Heroes) to existing archetypes to gain an edge in midrange mirrors largely decided by planeswalkers. [Purphoros, God of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%2C+God+of+the+Forge) was brought to the fore, as was [Revel of the Fallen God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revel+of+the+Fallen+God). Top 8 competitors Nikolas Labahn and Sebastian Kn√∂rr even unearthed mono-black, in two distinct versions at that, one aggressive, one very much control-oriented. With just over half the players in the Top 8 running [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), there was more variety on display than many had imagined possible.


In the end, however, it was Fabrizio Anteri combining the format's all stars [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) with black removal and blue's planeswalkers and [Prognostic Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx) in the trusty BUG Control who crushed all opposition. With this finish, he reached Gold in the Pro Players Club and secured his ticket to the World **Magic** Cup as the English national team's captain. When talking about levels, the story of Valentin Mackl may also not be left out here, as the Austrian, in his fourth Grand Prix Top 8 of the season, earned a much-needed invite to Pro Tour **Magic** 2015 in Portland to conclude the season with at least a Gold level as well.


Today, the golden trophy belongs to one man though. Congratulations to Fabrizio Anteri, champion of Grand Prix Manchester 2014!
