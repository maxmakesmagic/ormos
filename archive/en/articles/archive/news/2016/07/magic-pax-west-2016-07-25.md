Yeah, we take PAX West seriously. And we're going big again this year.


Bigger, even, as we take over the Paramount Theatre *and* the street outside.


PAX West is going to mark the debut event for *Kaladesh*, taking you inside Chandra's homeworld and revealing many of the set's wonders, widgets, and wizardry.


And whether you're able to make it to PAX West or you're stuck at home wishing you could, you'll be able to experience it all. From the *Kaladesh* Opening Program to the World Championship to the Street Fair to all of the panels.


And, yes, in true PAX fashion, there will be preview cards.


But we'll also be exploring the world with panels, shows, and roundtables. Live or from home, you can watch all of it.

Play *Magic* at PAX West!
=========================


But, of course, we're going to have plenty of opportunities to play *Magic* as well.


You can find the [full schedule of events from ChannelFireball on their website](http://www.channelfireball.com/pax-prime-2016-info-sheet/). Below you'll find the types of events we'll be offering.


**Inventors' League**


Check in at the League Office to receive your League lanyard, match card, and 60-card deck. Find other players anywhere at PAX West and challenge them to a game. Complete three games on your match card to receive a $2 discount to any of our scheduled events at PAX West!


**Special Booster Draft**


Special booster drafts will launch as soon as eight players register. To booster draft, you'll receive three packs. You'll open your first pack, select a card to add to your card pool, and pass the remaining cards around the table. Continue until all cards have been selected from the first pack. Repeat with the other two packs, then create a 40-card deck from your Draft pool plus basic lands, and play three games!


**Special Two-Headed Giant Sealed Deck**


Each two-player team will receive eight different booster packs from recent *Magic* expansions and basic lands, then construct two 40-card decks from them. Two-Headed Giant (2HG) is a team game where pairs of players share turns and life totals. Each player has their own separate deck and plays independently of their teammate. However, teammates share the goal of defeating the opposing team and may discuss their play decisions while playing. Play three games against opposing teams!


**Mini-Master**


Each player receives two *Magic Origins* booster packs and may add as many basic lands as needed to create a 30-card deck. After each game, all players receive an additional booster pack and have five minutes to rebuild their deck.


**Deck Builder's Toolkit Challenge**


Each player receives a Deck Builder's Toolkit, which includes four booster packs, 125 semi-randomized cards, and 100 basic lands. Players build a deck from the contents of the Deck Builder's Toolkit and play three games against opponents!
