If you've been checking out our [*Theros Beyond Death* Variants Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/theros-beyond-death-variants), then you know there are some wild, gorgeous variants coming with the set—from the constellation Gods and Demigods to the extended-art rares and mythic rares. Well, we've got one more set of pretty variants to throw at you before previews end—the *Theros Beyond Death* promos!


You've already seen the Buy-a-Box promo, but here it is again, just for completeness sake.

Finally, the *Theros Beyond Death* promo packs, which you can get by playing at your local game store, will include some of the set's best commons and uncommons with a special promo treatment.
