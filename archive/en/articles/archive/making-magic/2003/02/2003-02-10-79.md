You arrive home to see your little one run into your arms screaming, “Daddy!” This is the great ending to a great day. Well, actually an average day, but in this job an average day is a great day.


### YOU WIN!


That’s it. The day is over. I hope this gave you all a little insight into what my day is like.

Join me next week when I explore why we ban and restrict cards.

Until then, may you always pick the right path.
