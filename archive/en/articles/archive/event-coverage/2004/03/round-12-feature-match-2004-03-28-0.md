Richard Moore is an upcoming English player who is starting to find success on the tournament scene after starting out a judge. Richard still holds amateur status so is set to make a fair sum no matter what happens. Armin has been here before, having made the top eight of GP Prague last season. ### Game 1


Richard wins the coin-flip, but then took a succession of mulligans all the way down to four! Armin kept his seven.


Richard managed two [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s on his first two turns, but nothing on the third. Meanwhile Armin had a turn two [Tel-Jilad Chosen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Chosen) and a turn three [Viridian Joiner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Joiner). Richard mustered a turn three [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) which traded for Armin's Chosen, and Armin upgraded to a [Tel-Jilad Outrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Outrider). Richard found a third land in the form of a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and plays [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot). Armin's attack took him down to 15, and Armin made a [Somber Hoverguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard).


Richard made [Glissa Sunseeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa+Sunseeker), there's hope yet for the Englishman! Hoverguard took him down to 12, and Armin made a [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) of his own and a [Vedalken Engineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Engineer). Richard made a [Vulshok Battlegear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear) but still had no answer to the Hoveguard as he fell to 9 and Armin backed it up with a [Neurok Prodigy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Prodigy). Richard could find no answer to Armin's flying monsters and quickly succumbed.

### Game 2


Richard kept his opening hand this time, as did Armin. Armin kept a one-land, [Silver Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr), [Vedalken Engineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Engineer), [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) draw, but topped a land on his first turn and was all set for action. Richard made an [Arcbound Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger), a [Darksteel Pendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Pendant), and a [Neurok Hoversail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Hoversail), and then a [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) on his next turn. Armin meanwhile had found his third land and has all his accelerators in play, as well as having managed to pull out a [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem) and a [Sun Droplet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Droplet).


Armin took four from the Richard's Golem, and Armin added counters to his [Sun Droplet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Droplet). Richard Moore whipped out a tricky customer in the form of a [Fangren Firstborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Firstborn) - Armin was less than pleased! He made himself a [Malachite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malachite+Golem) and passed back.


Richard equipped a Hoversail to his Firstborn and attacked with all his creatures, adding counters. Armin's [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem) blocked the now 2/2 [Arcbound Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger), but Richard had [Echoing Courage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Courage) to boost the stinger up to 4/4 and take down the Golem! Armin fell to 11, but gained another 1 in his upkeep to 12.


Armin played and equipped [Mask of Memory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mask+of+Memory) to his [Malachite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malachite+Golem) and swung in for 5, dropping Richard to 15 and drawing two cards. After some deliberation he discarded a [Talisman of Unity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Unity), played out a [Viridian Joiner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Joiner) and passed the turn.


Richard drew and did some maths. He asked Armin how many cards he had in hand. "Two." came the response - the same as Richard. Richard attacked with all his creatures and Armin chumped the [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) with the [Viridian Joiner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Joiner). Armin dropped to 4 from the attack, Richard played some [Grimclaw Bats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grimclaw+Bats), and it was Armin's turn again.


Armin was in serious trouble now. His [Sun Droplet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Droplet) was absolutely overloaded with counters, but wasn't getting them off fast enough, while Richard's creatures were only getting bigger! Armin attacked with his [Malachite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malachite+Golem) and Richard chumped with the bats, forcing Armin to pay 1G to give the Golem trample. Armin tapped out for a [Wand of the Elements](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wand+of+the+Elements), and Richard showed him a [Vulshok Battlegear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear) to clinch the game.

### Game 3


Armin elected to play first. Both players kept their hands, and Richard had the first non-land play with a [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere). He made an [Iron Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr) on turn two, while Armin made a turn three [Viridian Joiner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Joiner). Richard had three [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s to go with his Myr, but played out only a lowly [Arcbound Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger), electing to keep his Sphere in play for now.


Armin played land number four and considered his options. He went with a [Tel-Jilad Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Exile) off his three [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s and the Joiner, leaving his one [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) untapped. Richard attacked for one and made a swamp, then cycled his sphere for green and changed whatever his plan was beforehand as he played a [Tangle Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Golem) off the top!


Armin seemed less than happy with the way the game was heading. He thought for some time before tapping out for an [Arcbound Bruiser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Bruiser), and passed the turn. Meanwhile Richard found another black source in the form of [Vault of Whispers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+of+Whispers), and attacked for six between his Golem and Stinger. Down came a [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem), although Richard was short the mana to regenerate, and it was Armin's turn again.


Armin played and cycled a [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) for blue mana, then found his second [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) off the top anyway. He only had a [Vedalken Engineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Engineer) to play though, and attacked Richard down to 17 with his [Arcbound Bruiser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Bruiser).


Richard declared his attack, and not to be dissuaded by Armin's regenerating troll blocker, sent in both Golems and his Stinger. Armin blocked the [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) with his Troll and both players regenerated. Richard aggressively played a [Pulse of the Tangle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Tangle) for a single 3/3 creature, and the Pulse went straight to the graveyard. Armin then finally played a green rare of his own - [Molder Slug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Slug)! Richard untapped and sacrificed his [Iron Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr), perhaps now regretting burning the Pulse for a single 3/3! Both Golems and the Stinger went in, although the 3/3 Beast Token stayed at home. Armin blocked the Golems with his Joiner and Exile and Richard regenerated, both Armin's creatures going to the bin.


Armin then played a [Nuisance Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nuisance+Engine) to combo with his [Molder Slug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Slug)!! Things were starting to look dodgy for Richard, and Armin attacked him down to 13 with the Slug. Richard sacrificed his [Vault of Whispers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+of+Whispers) and drew. "Where are you Glissa??" he cried, but she was no-where to be seen. Still, Armin was dangerously low on life. Richard sent in all his creatures, and played [Echoing Decay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay) when Armin made a Pest Token before blockers.


Armin's [Arcbound Bruiser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Bruiser) eventually chump blocked Richard's [Tangle Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Golem), and Richard expended his last card - [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) - to return Richard's [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) before blockers. Richard was down to one card but Armin was completely out, and down to seven life.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbir04/fm15_2.jpg)Armin made a Pest during his upkeep and sacrificed his [Nuisance Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nuisance+Engine) to the [Molder Slug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Slug). He had no plays on his turn. Richard untapped and floated black mana, then sacrificed his [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) before drawing and placed a regeneration shield on the [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) in his draw step. He attacked, and Armin blocked the [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) with a Pest, while his Slug took out Richard's [Tangle Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Golem). Armin was down to three. Richard played out a [Nim Lasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Lasher) and passed.


Armin untapped with naught but a Slug remaining, signed deeply after drawing his card, and slumped back in his chair, shaking his head. Armin played and equipped [Mask of Memory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mask+of+Memory) to his Slug, and when Richard chumped the attack with his Nim, Armin scooped up his cards.
