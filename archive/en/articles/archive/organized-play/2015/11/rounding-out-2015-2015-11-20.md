The year 2015 is wrapping up, and along with it, a number of the year's premier play offerings. The last two Grand Prix of 2015 take place this weekend. After that, the 2015 World *Magic* Cup awaits.


2015's Last Two Grand Prix
==========================


[Grand Prix Kōbe](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-kobe-2015) and [Grand Prix Pittsburgh](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-pittsburgh-2015) round out the 2015 schedule with a little Constructed action.


Kōbe, Japan, will be playing host to a Standard Constructed main event as players from Asia and beyond compete for one of the last 2015 trophies to be given out.


All players who registered for the Grand Prix Kōbe main event by September 9 will be receiving an event-exclusive playmat featuring the art from [Oran-Rief Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oran-Rief+Hydra).

As we learned last weekend, Standard isn't done evolving, as Team EUreka's Four-Color Rally deck took the tournament by storm, and Esper Dragons made a big comeback in the hands of the Cabin Crew. Will these decks perform this weekend? Will any new decks or tech emerge? Will Lee Shi Tian play a combo deck?


Check back over the weekend as coverage writer Ben Swartz reports on his findings!


Also taking place this weekend is Grand Prix Pittsburgh, as North America closes out 2015's Grand Prix schedule with Modern Constructed madness. All players who compete in the Pittsburgh main event will receive an event-exclusive playmat featuring the iconic art of [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), one of the Burn deck's iconic creatures!

The Modern format is relatively fresh in many people's minds, as it was the format for the most recent round of Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers. With a plethora of awesome craziness available to players, what deck will rise to the top this weekend?


Tune in all weekend to find out, as Grand Prix Pittsburgh will feature live video coverage on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic)! More details on start times can be found in the Viewing Guide later in this article.


2015 World *Magic* Cup Approaching
==================================


It's hard to believe, but we're only three weeks away from the 2015 World *Magic* Cup, a monumental tournament that features four representatives each from 73 countries all competing on the big stage for their share of $250,000 and the title of World *Magic* Cup Champions.


The 2015 World *Magic* Cup is the year's biggest team spectacle. Each country's team comprises four players: the three World *Magic* Cup Qualifier winners and the player from the country who earned the most Pro Points during the 2014–15 Premier Play Season (that player is given the title of National Champion).


The four players then select teams of three to compete in two different formats in this three-day show: Team Sealed using twelve *Battle for Zendikar* boosters, and [Team Unified Standard](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/teamunified), a unique format.


The full tournament details on the 2015 World *Magic* Cup can be found on the [event information page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2015-world-magic-cup-event-information). We'll be talking more about one of *Magic*'s most exciting premier-level spectacles in the coming weeks, so check back for more as we get closer to December 11–13!

The Flashback
=============


Last weekend had the spotlight on two cities, Brussels and Atlanta, each with their own formats and big stories.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/daily/GP-City-Only-Brussels-Black%202.png)


In Brussels, the story of this 1,938-person tournament revolved around two teams: Team EUreka and Team Cabin Crew. EUreka stormed this event with a Four-Color [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors) deck that took a lot of people by surprise and put three of their teammates into the Top 8 (along with many not far behind). Team Cabin Crew, on the flip side, also placed multiple teammates into the Top 8 using Esper Dragons, a deck that had fallen off the map after the Pro Tour.


Sure enough, the finals came down to Cabin Crew's Lukas Blohon against EUreka's Simon Nielsen, each piloting their team's signature deck of the event. Blohon ultimately overcame Nielsen's devastating combo deck with strong sideboarding and [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) in three games to claim the trophy.

Meanwhile, Atlanta brought in more than 2,000 players for some *Battle for Zendikar* Limited action. The Top 8 featured some big names, with Owen Turtenwald and Tom Martell squaring off in the final match. Ultimately, it was Tom Martell who emerged as the winner, taking the match against Turtenwald 2-0.
