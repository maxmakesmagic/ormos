Hey, remember when we [announced *Premium Deck Series: Fire & Lightning*](/en/articles/archive/announcing-premium-deck-series-fire-lightning-2010-06-22)? And we told you all about how it was a sixty-card all-foil deck packed with burn spells and quick creatures from across the history of **Magic**?

Well, sharp-eyed viewers (which sounds like a medical condition that would make blinking painful) probably noticed that we didn't show a picture of the product itself. We did show this neat new piece of art, though:

Well, the reason we didn't show you the box is that it kind of gives away what card that art is for. But we've been thinking about that decision, and you know what? We're going to show it to you after all. Why not? You deserve it.

Behold!

Oh, that reveals a couple of other cards, too. How about that.


*Premium Deck Series: Fire & Lightning* comes out November 19, 2010. The MSRP is $34.99.
