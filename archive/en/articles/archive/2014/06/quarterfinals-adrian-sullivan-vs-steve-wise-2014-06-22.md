**The Players**



This has been an excellent couple of weeks for Adrian Sullivan. After falling just short of making the Top 8 at the StarCityGames Invitational this past weekend, Sullivan shot out to a perfect 9-0 record on Day 1 here in Chicago. Things were dicey to open the day, as Sullivan lost two of the first rounds he played today before eventually rallying to make it into the Top 8. Standing in the way of Sullivan's shot at redemption is Steve Wise of Omaha, NE. Wise has a Grand Prix Top 16 on his resume in the past, and he was the last undefeated player here at Grand Prix Chicago.



**The Decks**




 Both Sullivan and Wise are running the WU Control deck that has supplanted Esper Control as the dominant control deck in Standard. It is a pure control deck, relying on blue counterspells to keep things from hitting the board and white to clear away the permanents that have. Between [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere), and a slew of other potential removal spells, WU Control is able to buy enough time for cards like [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) to find the Planeswalker threats: [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought), and [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion). For those long mirror matches, such as this one, [Elixir of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality) works especially hard, giving the deck that is able to activate it inevitability in this grinding matchup.
