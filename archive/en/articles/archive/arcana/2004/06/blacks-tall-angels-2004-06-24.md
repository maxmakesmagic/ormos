Sure, sure, the color white is full of angels because white represents justice, virtue and hope, and so do angels -- most of the time. But angels in **Magic** aren't strictly white -- [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) is an artifact, [Lightning Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) is tri-color -- and then there's the black angels.


But [black](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr109) is the perversion of justice and virtue -- it's the color that's out for itself, at the cost of anything that stands in its way. How do angels end up allied with black? Generally it's because they're corrupted by black mana, such as by a powerful black-aligned wizard. 


Today's Magic Arcana showcases the art of some of these fallen angels (including, of course, [Fallen Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Angel) itself). As in the earlier [Tall Angels](/en/articles/archive/tall-angels-2004-02-26) arcana, these pieces are often too large to represent fully within the **Magic** card frame, so we present them here in their full aspect ratio (not "in their full glory" -- that's a white thing). Get a finger ready on that scroll wheel.
