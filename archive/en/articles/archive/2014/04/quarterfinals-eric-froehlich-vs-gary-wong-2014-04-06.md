For No. 23 Player Eric Froehlich, another Grand Prix Top 8 was a welcome sight. After narrowly missing the Top 8 of Grand Prix Cincinnati with a very similar version of the Black/red Devotion deck he brought with him today, the Las Vegas resident and Platinum pro made up for two weekends ago with an incredible run through the last two days, finishing Day One as one of five undefeated players and locking up his spot in the Top 8 with a draw in the fourteenth round.



 His opponent, Phoenix Arizona local Gary Wong, was also rocking a newer iteration of an old archetype. His Blue Devotion deck splashed white, a decision that has become increasingly popular due to the inclusion of [Temple of Enlightenment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Enlightenment) and the ability to play [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere), a card that has made the match-up against [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) decks far better than previous.



It was a match-up Froehlich was not thrilled to start his Top 8 with, but the Vegas resident and ChannelFireball team member puts up incredible and consistent numbers at each event. If there is anyone that can overcome a rough match-up in this Top 8, it is him. 



**The Games**




 The first game looked fine for Wong in the first two turns, who had three flying creatures on the first turn that could set up a potentially devastating early [Bident of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa) if Wong had it. However, what Wong did not have was a third land or even a second blue source, his [Godless Shrine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godless+Shrine) proving to be a burden.
