Z*endikar* wasn't the first appearance of traps in **Magic**. A quick Gatherer search will reveal the existence of [Traproot Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traproot+Kami)s and [Trapjaw Kelpie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trapjaw+Kelpie)s, and Trappers of the [Ballynock Trapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ballynock%2BTrapper), [Benalish Trapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Benalish%2BTrapper), [Dauthi Trapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dauthi%2BTrapper), and [Rathi Trapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Rathi%2BTrapper) varieties. There are even [Giant Trap Door Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Trap+Door+Spider)s and, if you squint, [Kongming's Contraptions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kongming%2527s%2BContraptions) and [Extraplanar Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Extraplanar%2BLens)es to look out for.


But there's one pre-*Zendikar* trap that has a striking similarity to the deadly peril that awaits adventurers in the latest set. Can you think of what it is?
