As we wrap up 2005, I guess it's only right to wrap up You Make the Card #3. The final step is choosing the flavor text for the card. As a reminder, here is the card as it stands now:

![Vanish Into Memory](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/ymtc3_vanish.jpg)

Remember that the goal with the flavor text was to tie all the elements of the card together. Here are your ten choices. (As always, credit for the flavor text will be given after the voting is completed.) 

**Which of these should be Vanish Into Memory's flavor text?****#1** - *"Death is a hero's first step to immortality." - Boros Drill Master.* [NOTE: ATTRIBUTION WILL CHANGE]  
**#2** - *â€œKnowledge manifested from power, memory vanished from weakness...."*  
**#3** - *Out of sight, into mind.*  
**#4** - *"Shut eyes memorize; open eyes mesmerize." - Wizard's incantation*  
**#5** - *The trick is not to find treasure in the mind, but to keep it with open eyes.*  
**#6** - *...and emerge as possibility.*  
**#7** -  *A dream is just a reality vanished into memory. A reality is a dream come true.*  
**#8** - *A memory is what is left when something happens and doesn't completely unhappen.*  
**#9** -  *Its absence brings wealth, and sadness;   
Its return, both joy and madness.*  
**#10** - *Which do you choose; fleeting valor or wisdom soon unremembered?*  
  
The deadline for this vote is this Sunday, December 18th.

Early next year, we will show you the completed card and let you know which expansion will give you a chance to get a Vanish Into Memory of your very own.
