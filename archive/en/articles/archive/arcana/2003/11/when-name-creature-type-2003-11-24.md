Some no-nonsense creature cards just come out and say what they are right in their name. How many cards can you think of that have the same name as creature type?


Several cards with one-word names share that word with their creature type, such as [Orgg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orgg), [Cockatrice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cockatrice), [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone), [Fungusaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fungusaur), [Nekrataal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal), and [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare). 



Other cards with multiple-word names have a creature type that is the same string of words (in each of these cases, in their Oracle text, the creature type has been changed to a single hyphenated word). See for example [Will-O'-The-Wisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Will-O%27-The-Wisp), [Ali from Cairo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ali+from+Cairo), [Gaea's Liege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Liege), [Ali Baba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ali+Baba), [Ambush Party](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambush+Party), [Ball Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning), [El-Hajjaj](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=El-Hajjaj), [Flying Men](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Men)... oh, just read the [list of creature types](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/jm54) that [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) is and look for just about anything with a hyphen.



But there are very few cards that have both a multiple-word name and a group of separate creature subtypes that exactly match. *Legions'* 
[Goblin Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Assassin) is the big winner here. Whether *Legends'* 
[Cat Warriors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cat+Warriors) (which actually, according to its Oracle text, is a Cat *Warrior*, singular) counts is up to you. (As printed, as you can see in the pic below, its creature type is Cat Warrior*s*.)

No points for guessing [Bird Maiden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bird+Maiden) or [Goblin Mutant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Mutant) - they don't actually count as a Bird or a Mutant, respectively. Some more recent "near misses" include [Dragon Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mage), which is a Dragon Wizard, and [Vedalken Archmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Archmage), which is a Vedalken Wizard. Those crafty *(ahem)* Wizards.
