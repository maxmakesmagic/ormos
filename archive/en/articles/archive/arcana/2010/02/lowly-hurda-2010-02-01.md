The flavor text for [Caravan Hurda](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caravan+Hurda) describes them as "Not too bright, but good enough for the job required—carrying and walking in a straight line." They do their job (picking things up and carrying them), and that's about it. They're placid. Tranquil. Docile.


So what happens when you hit one with red magic and give it large horns and a ferocious temperament?
