After World Championships the *Odyssey* Block Constructed field seems more open than ever. Walking around the tables at today's event one can see everything from [Soulcatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulcatcher)'s Aerie to basic mountain. There's plenty of surprises in store. However, there are a number of decks that have proven their worth, and are represented in greater numbers than others. Here's an abridged run-down.

**Blue-Green Madness**

![Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wild+Mongrel)The template for this monster that has taken OBC by storm is the English Standard deck "Deep Dog". The green Madness heavy-hitters are powered out by the enablers [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba). [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst) and [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) keep the tempo game going. [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) lets the deck outrace the opponent. [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) helps make sure cards end up in the zone they're supposed to. After that, the pattern breaks down. Do you run the powerhouse [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur)? Will there be few enough Bursts that [Elephant Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Guide) will be a wrecking ball? For that matter, how many Roars should you run? [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop) and [Krosan Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation) are popular choices out of the 'board.**Mono-Black Control**

When it works, it's like you've managed to sneak an extended deck into the tournament. With more mana and better spells than your opponent, Mono-Black tends to turn the unfairness up to eleven. Gary Wise ran this beast to a 6-0 at Sydney. Eight Edicts and the black Wrath handle any creatures that touch down. [Mind Sludge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge) exterminates the hand, while [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor), [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) and [Tainted Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Pact) churn through to business. [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), while absurdly powerful, has been deemed optional.

**Punisher Blue-White**

![Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Quiet+Speculation)A surprise success at Worlds, Team Punisher's blue-white aggro deck ensured Tuomas Kotiranta his Top 8 spot, and, if not for misplaying his [Spurnmage Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spurnmage+Advocate)s, Anton Jonsson would have joined him. Founded on [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation), it can either dig up [Battle Screech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech)es to win in the air, Deep Analyses to outdraw the opponent, or tutor up a lone [Prismatic Strands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Strands) to win a race. [Divine Sacrament](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Sacrament) beefs up the mob of efficient white creatures, and [Spurnmage Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spurnmage+Advocate) singlehandedly wrecks blue-green. Oh, and let's not forget about [Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory).**Green-White Madness**

[Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory) also shines in this powerhouse creature feature. [Tireless Tribe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tribe) teams up with [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) to ensure quick Wurms and Rootwallas. The fat doesn't stop there, however, as [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) and [Anurid Brushhopper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Brushhopper) start hitting early and rarely stop. [Elephant Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Guide) and [Krosan Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation) round out the arsenal.

**Blue-Green Threshold**

Dave Humpherys took this group of cards to a perfect day, earning himself a Top 8 berth. He chose to run only Mongoose and [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) as his threshold creatures, leaving the [Seton's Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Scout)s to Raphael Levy. [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) and [Mental Note](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Note) pile high the graveyard to turn them on. [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill)s compliment his one casting-cost army, as does [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst). The ubiquitous [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) and [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) are here, too. [Centaur Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Garden) helps push through the final damage. The board is chocked with matchup-specific nightmares, like [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest), [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) and [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop).

**Blue-Green [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation)**

![Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wonder)The dedicated version of this deck was played by none other than Kai Budde, who ran it at Worlds to a respectable 5-1 finish on the day. [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla), [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) and [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) stand shoulder-to-shoulder with [Catalyst Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catalyst+Stone)s, [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation), [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) and [Grizzly Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Fate). [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) and [Mental Note](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Note) pack the graveyard while [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop) runs defence. [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) are tutorable one-of's. Contrast that design with Dario Minieri's 6-0 Speculation/Madness hybrid. It boasts most of the madness package, but makes room for a pair of Speculations, along with [Acorn Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acorn+Harvest), [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Krosan Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation) in case of emergency. Otherwise, they just dig up Roars for the win.
