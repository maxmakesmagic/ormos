With *Ravnica Allegiance* now live on [*Magic: The Gathering Arena*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena?DailyMTG), a whole host of new creatures are springing to life on the battlefield! This seems like a great time to showcase a few of these creatures with the animations that play each time you summon one of them to fight by your side.


You may have already seen these animations during the *MTG Arena* Early Access Streamer Event, which previewed the changes coming with the [latest patch](https://forums.mtgarena.com/forums/threads/45109) before they went live globally. Seeing them a second (or third, or fourth . . .) time doesn't make them any less cool, though!

And if you're looking to keep the damage party going long term, it doesn't get much better than a turn-three [Spawn of Mayhem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawn+of+Mayhem)!
