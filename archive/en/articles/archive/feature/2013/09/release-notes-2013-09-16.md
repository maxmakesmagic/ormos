 The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new **Magic: The Gathering** set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://wizards.custhelp.com/). 

The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.

The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

 **Theme: The **Magic** of the Gods** 


 All **Magic** sets have powerful enchantment cards, and the *Theros* set features many Auras and other enchantments of the kind we're all used to playing with. But the *Theros* set also gives players enchantments unlike anything they've seen before. These new cards combine the enchantment card type with other card types to represent how the gods of Theros and their creations manifest themselves in the realm of mortals. 

 A unique graphical treatment on the cards shows the starry sky of Nyx—home of Theros's pantheon of gods—shining through the top half of the card frame. This frame element makes it easier for players to see at a glance which creatures and artifacts on the battlefield are also enchantments. 

Let's look at three representative cards before we dive into the details in subsequent sections of this document.

Heliod's Emissary is one of the fifteen other enchantment creatures in the set. Not all of these creatures are connected to the five Gods, but all of them have the bestow ability. See "New Keyword: Bestow" for more information.

Spear of Heliod is part of a cycle of five legendary enchantment artifact cards, one in each color, that have a flavorful connection to the five Gods.


* A permanent that is both an enchantment and another permanent type can be affected by spells or abilities that affect either type. For example, a spell that says "Exile target enchantment" will exile an enchantment creature or an enchantment artifact.
  
* If an enchantment creature is turned into a creature (using Opalescence, for example), its printed power and toughness will be overwritten by the power and toughness defined by the animating effect. It will retain any supertypes and subtypes it may have had unless the animating effect specifically overwrites them.

**New Keyword: Bestow**


Bestow is a new keyword that represents the ability of some enchantment creatures, denizens of the gods' realm of Nyx, to infuse their essences into others. Creatures with bestow can be cast either as creatures or as Auras targeting a creature.

It becomes a creature again if it's not attached to a creature.)*
>   
>  Flying   
>  Enchanted creature gets +2/+2 and has flying. 

The official rules for bestow are as follows:


> 
> 702.102. Bestow
> 
> 
> 702.102a Bestow represents two static abilities, one that functions while the card with bestow is on the stack and another that functions both while it's on the stack and while it's on the battlefield. "Bestow [cost]" means "You may cast this card by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost." and "If you chose to pay this spell's bestow cost, it becomes an Aura enchantment and gains enchant creature. These effects last until one of two things happens: this spell has an illegal target as it resolves or the permanent this spell becomes, becomes unattached." Paying a card's bestow cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e–g.
> 
> 
> 702.102b If a spell's controller chooses to pay its bestow cost, that player chooses a legal target for that Aura spell as defined by its enchant creature ability and rule 601.2c. See also rule 303.4.
> 
> 
> 702.102c A spell's controller can't choose to pay its bestow cost unless that player can choose a legal target for that spell after it becomes an Aura spell.
> 
> 
> 702.102d As an Aura spell with bestow begins resolving, if its target is illegal, the effect making it an Aura spell ends. It continues resolving as a creature spell and will be put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell's controller. This is an exception to rule 608.3a.
> 
> 
> 


* You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the creature card in whatever zone you're casting it from. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash will allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant.
  
* On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both.
  
* Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
  
* Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif) abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
  
* If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
  
* Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.

**New Ability Word: Heroic**


 On the epic world of *Theros*, exceptional acts of heroism are sometimes required to survive. Heroic is an ability word that appears in italics at the beginning of abilities that trigger whenever you cast a spell that targets the creature with the heroic ability. (An ability word has no rules meaning.) 


> 
> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/ths/obasdfkjw8324lz/DK9cvf2tWIJ_EN_LR.jpg)Setessan Battle Priest   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  
>  Creature — Human Cleric   
>  1/3   
> *Heroic* — Whenever you cast a spell that targets Setessan Battle Priest, you gain 2 life.   
> 


* Heroic abilities will resolve before the spell that caused them to trigger.
  
* Heroic abilities will trigger only once per spell, even if that spell targets the creature with the heroic ability multiple times.
  
* Heroic abilities won't trigger when a copy of a spell is created on the stack or when a spell's targets are changed to include a creature with a heroic ability.

**New Keyword Action: Monstrosity**


 Monsters of myth prowl the landscape of Theros, striking fear into the stoutest of hearts. Monstrosity is a new keyword action that puts +1/+1 counters on a creature and may cause other abilities to trigger for further bonuses. 


> 
> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/ths/obasdfkjw8324lz/E3kT7i42COQ_EN_LR.jpg)Keepsake Gorgon

>   
>  When Keepsake Gorgon becomes monstrous, destroy target non-Gorgon creature an opponent controls. 

The official rules for monstrosity are as follows:


> 
> 701.28. Monstrosity
> 
> 
> 701.28a "Monstrosity N" means "If this permanent isn't monstrous, put N +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes monstrous." Monstrous is a condition of that permanent that can be referred to by other abilities.
> 
> 
> 701.28b If a permanent's ability instructs a player to "monstrosity X," other abilities of that permanent may also refer to X. The value of X in those abilities is equal to the value of X as that permanent became monstrous.
> 
> 
> 


* Once a creature becomes monstrous, it can't become monstrous again. If the creature is already monstrous when the monstrosity ability resolves, nothing happens.
  
* Monstrous isn't an ability that a creature has. It's just something true about that creature. If the creature stops being a creature or loses its abilities, it will continue to be monstrous.
  
* An ability that triggers when a creature becomes monstrous won't trigger if that creature isn't on the battlefield when its monstrosity ability resolves.

**New Term: Devotion**


The pantheon of gods rewards the allegiance of mortals with magnificent wonders. Devotion is a new rules term that counts colored mana symbols to determine the magnitude of effects.

>   
> 

The official rule for devotion is as follows:


> 
> 700.5. A player's devotion to [color] is equal to the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents that player controls.
> 
> 
> 


* Numeric mana symbols (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif), ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif), and so on) in mana costs of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
  
* Mana symbols in the text boxes of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
  
* Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).
  
* If an activated ability or triggered ability has an effect that depends on your devotion to a color, you count the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents you control as the ability resolves. The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.

**Returning Keyword Action: Scry**


 Scry is a returning keyword action that lets you get a glimpse of your future and possibly change it. It most recently appeared in the ***Magic** 2011*  Core set. 


> 
> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/ths/obasdfkjw8324lz/npY78banq1t_EN_LR.jpg)Spark Jolt

>  Instant   
>  Spark Jolt deals 1 damage to target creature or player. Scry 1. *(Look at the top card of your library. You may put that card on the bottom of your library.)*
> 

The official rules for scry are as follows:


> 
> 701.18. Scry
> 
> 
> 701.18a To "scry N" means to look at the top N cards of your library, put any number of them on the bottom of your library in any order, and put the rest on top of your library in any order.
> 
> 
> 


* When you scry, you may put all the cards you look at back on top of your library, you may put all of those cards on the bottom of your library, or you may put some of those cards on top and the rest of them on the bottom.
  
* You choose how to order those cards no matter where you put them.
  
* You perform the actions stated on a card in sequence. For some spells and abilities, that means you'll scry last. For others, that means you'll scry and then perform other actions.
  
* Scry appears on some spells and abilities with one or more targets. If all of the spell or ability's targets are illegal when it tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't scry.

 The gods of Theros are ethereal beings who live among the stars. If mortals' belief in them is strong enough, they can manifest themselves and wage war beside them.

* The type-changing ability that can make the God not be a creature functions only on the battlefield. It's always a creature card in other zones, regardless of your devotion to its color.
  
* If a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not, for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.
  
* If a God stops being a creature, it loses the type creature and all creature subtypes. It continues to be a legendary enchantment.
  
* The abilities of Gods function as long as they're on the battlefield, regardless of whether they're creatures.
  
* If a God is attacking or blocking and it stops being a creature, it will be removed from combat.
  
* If a God is dealt damage, then stops being a creature, then becomes a creature again later in the same turn, the damage will still be marked on it. This is also true for any effects that were affecting the God when it was originally a creature. (Note that in most cases, the damage marked on the God won't matter because it has indestructible.)

**Cycle: Ordeals of the Gods**


 The *Theros* set includes an Aura of each color that represents a challenge from one of the gods.

>  When you sacrifice Ordeal of Erebos, target player discards two cards.   
> 


* The +1/+1 counter is put on the creature before blockers are declared and before combat damage is dealt.
  
* The check of whether the enchanted creature has three or more +1/+1 counters on it happens as part of the resolution of the attack triggered ability. If the third +1/+1 counter is put on the enchanted creature any other way, you won't sacrifice the Ordeal until the next time the creature attacks.
  
* If you sacrifice the Ordeal in some other way, its last ability will trigger.

**Rule Change: The "Planeswalker Uniqueness Rule" and the "Legend Rule"**


 Two rule changes introduced with the ***Magic** 2014*  Core set impact how cards in the *Theros* set function. 

Under the previous rules, if there were two or more legendary permanents with the same name on the battlefield or two or more planeswalkers that share a subtype (such as "Jace") on the battlefield, they would all be put into their owners' graveyards as a state-based action. These rules have changed. The new rules are as follows:


> 
> 704.5j If a player controls two or more planeswalkers that share a planeswalker type, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the "planeswalker uniqueness rule."
> 
> 
> 704.5k If a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the "legend rule."

* If Abhorrent Overlord is the only creature you control when its second triggered ability resolves, you must sacrifice it.

* You choose the target for the triggered ability when the ability is put onto the stack. You choose whether or not Artisan of Forms becomes a copy of that creature when the ability resolves.
  
* Artisan of Forms copies the printed values of the creature plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy any other effects that have changed that creature's power, toughness, color, and so on. Artisan of Forms won't copy any counters on the creature, but Artisan of Forms will retain any counters it already had on it.
  
* If Artisan of Forms becomes a copy of a token creature, it copies the original characteristics of that token as defined by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. It won't become a token creature.
  
* The copy effect lasts indefinitely. Often, it will last until it is overwritten by another copy effect (if it copies another creature on a future turn, perhaps).
  
* If the creature is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve, the ability will be countered. Artisan of Forms won't become a copy of that creature. It remains whatever it was a copy of.
  
* When Artisan of Forms becomes a copy of a creature, it's neither entering nor leaving the battlefield. Any enters-the-battlefield or leaves-the-battlefield abilities won't trigger.
  
* If another creature becomes a copy of Artisan of Forms, it will become a copy of whatever Artisan of Forms is currently copying (if anything), plus it will have the triggered ability.

* Ashiok's second ability refers to any creature card exiled because of Ashiok's first or third ability.

* If Ashiok leaves the battlefield, and later another Ashiok enters the battlefield, it is a new object (even if the two were represented by the same card). Creature cards exiled by the original Ashiok can't be put onto the battlefield by the second ability of the new Ashiok.

* If some but not all of Boulderfall's targets become illegal, you can't change the division of damage. Damage that would have been dealt to illegal targets simply isn't dealt.
  
* You can't deal damage to both a player and a planeswalker that player controls using Boulderfall. You also can't deal damage to more than one planeswalker controlled by the same player. If you choose to redirect the damage being dealt to a player to a planeswalker, you must redirect all the damage to a single planeswalker.
  
* If an effect creates a copy of Boulderfall, the division of damage and number of targets can't be changed. The effect that creates the copy may allow you to change targets, however.

>  Enchantment — Aura   
>  Enchant Mountain you control   
>  Flying   
>  When Chained to the Rocks enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls until Chained to the Rocks leaves the battlefield. *(That creature returns under its owner's control.)*
> 


* If the land Chained to the Rocks is enchanting stops being a Mountain or another player gains control of it, Chained to the Rocks will be put into its owner's graveyard when state-based actions are performed.
  
* Chained to the Rocks's ability causes a zone change with a duration, a style of ability introduced in ***Magic** 2014*  that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like Chained to the Rocks have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after Chained to the Rocks leaves the battlefield.
  
* If Chained to the Rocks leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
  
* Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards (unless they have bestow). Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
  
* If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
  
* The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after Chained to the Rocks leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
  
* In a multiplayer game, if Chained to the Rocks's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

* If Daxos is blocked by a creature, raising that creature's power to 3 or greater won't change or undo the block.
  
* If the exiled card is a land card, you won't gain any life and you won't be able to play the land.
  
* You must pay all costs to cast the exiled card. You may pay alternative or additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
  
* Daxos doesn't change when you can cast the exiled card. For example, if you exile a creature card without flash, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.

* An "extra turn" is any turn created by a spell or ability. Notably, it doesn't include additional turns taken in tournaments after time expires for a round.
  
* It doesn't matter whose turn it is. In very rare cases, an opponent may be taking an extra turn and gain control of Medomai. Medomai can't attack during that turn.

That player may choose new targets for the copy. 


* Meletis Charlatan's ability can target any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets and not just one that you control.
  
* When the ability resolves, it creates a copy of the spell. The controller of the original spell controls the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
  
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless its controller chooses new ones. That player may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, that player can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
  
* If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. Its controller can't choose a different one.
  
* If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Curse of the Swine has), the copy has the same value of X.

* Unlike most abilities that use devotion to determine the magnitude of an effect, Mogis's Marauder uses devotion to determine the number of targets its ability has.

* The number of targets chosen for the triggered ability must be at least one (if X wasn't 0) and at most X. You choose the division of damage as you put the ability on the stack, not as it resolves. Each target must be assigned at least 1 damage. In multiplayer games, you may choose creatures controlled by different opponents.

>  You may cast creature cards as though they had flash. 


* Creatures and lands you control untap at the same time as the active player's permanents. You can't choose to not untap them at that time.
  
* Effects that state a creature or land you control doesn't untap during your untap step won't apply during another player's untap step.
  
* Controlling more than one Prophet of Kruphix doesn't allow you to untap any creature or land more than once during a single untap step.
  
* You can cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura as though it had flash.
  
* The last ability applies to creature cards in any zone, provided something is allowing you to cast them. For example, if you control a Zombie, you could cast Gravecrawler (a creature with "You may cast Gravecrawler from your graveyard as long as you control a Zombie") from your graveyard as though it had flash.

* Soldier of the Pantheon can't be enchanted or equipped by multicolored Auras and Equipment, it can't be blocked by multicolored creatures, it can't be targeted by multicolored spells or abilities from multicolored sources, and all damage dealt to it by multicolored sources is prevented.
  
* Most hybrid spells and permanents, including the ones in the *Return to Ravnica* block, are multicolored, even if you cast them with one color of mana.

It gains haste. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step. If it would leave the battlefield, exile it instead of putting it anywhere else. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery. 


* At the beginning of the next end step, the creature returned to the battlefield with Whip of Erebos is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
  
* Whip of Erebos grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
  
* If a creature returned to the battlefield with Whip of Erebos would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead. However, if that creature is already being exiled, then the replacement effect won't apply. If the spell or ability that exiles it later returns it to the battlefield (as Chained to the Rocks might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The effects from Whip of Erebos will no longer apply to it.
  
* The exiled creature is never put into the graveyard. Any abilities the creature has that trigger when it dies won't trigger.
