What is the most underrated card in Modern?
===========================================

**Reid Duke (11 Grand Prix Top 8s):** [Auriok Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Champion). It's good against [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), Jund and Grixis and most of these decks have a huge problem killing.

**Alexander Hayne (Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* Champion):** [Simian Spirit Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide). It enables the most broken plays in Modern.

**Jason Chung (Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* Top 8):** [Leyline of Punishment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Punishment). It's a better card at stopping Grishoalbrand than [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void).

**Sun Bo (3 Grand Prix Top 8s):** Relic of [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus). It's excellent against all the Blue Red decks, any deck with [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and also keeps [Goryo's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance) in check.

**Martin JÅ¯za (22 Grand Prix Top 8s):** Geez, I wish I knew! Maybe [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) since its great in Infect and Zoo?

**Taufik Indrakesuma (Grand Prix Manila Finalist):** [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas). People expect it much lesser than [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon).
