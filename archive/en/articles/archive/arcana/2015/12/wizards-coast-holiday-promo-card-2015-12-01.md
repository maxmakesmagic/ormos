Oh, the weather outside is frightfulâ€”and your opponents will soon see why when you shove this Goblin Sleigh Ride right up their battlefield.


The Holiday Promo Card is something we've done for years around this time to celebrate the holidays and provide our partners, contractors, and employees with a fun treat to say thank you for being great. Chances are, if you receive one of these, we think you're pretty awesome.


So put on your heavy coat and snow pants, wrap a scarf around your neck, and sing a slaying song tonight!
