Kai's removal heavy deck also had a lot of mana acceleration with two talismans and two myrs, making him the favorite this round. 

### Game 1

Olivier won the toss and started with a first turn [Bonesplitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter). A [Copper Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr) came down for him on his second turn, but he only had a 3 drop to play on his third turn – a [Wizard Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica). Kai [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)ed Olivier's [Bonesplitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter) and played a [Goblin Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica). [Silver Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr) was on the top of Olivier's library and he smashed it on the table. Kai added a [Clockwork Condor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Condor) to his side of the table but Olivier would have none of it and played a Loomering Hoverguard, putting Kai's Condor back on top of his library. A [Consume Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit) would deal with the blue flier though.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplyo03/a892.jpg)A [Wurmskin Forger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmskin+Forger) made all of Olivier's creatures a little more scary – his [Copper Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr) received a counter and the other two stayed on the green creature. A [Goblin War Wagon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Wagon) showed up on Olivier's side as well after he attacked his Myr into Kai's Condor. As the [Wurmskin Forger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmskin+Forger) went unblocked, Kai fell to 12. The German's next turn went by eventless, but when Olivier attacked next turn, Kai's [Goblin Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica) chumpblocked and then destroyed the War Wagon. A [Lumengrid Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Augur) showed up on Olivier's side, electing a "stop drawing spells every turn please" from Kai. It wasn't to be however as an Aether Spellbomb dealt with Kai's last blocker.

"I'm sure I still had a good card left in my deck"- Olivier

"Yeah, maybe a creature. I sure had some left in mine"- Kai

Ruel 1 – Budde 0

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplyo03/a893.jpg)Once again Olivier had a first turn [Bonesplitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter) but not the Myr to follow it up. Kai shattered the equipment before the Frenchman had a chance to put it on one of his creatures. A Wizard replica came down next, together with a Tel-Jihad Exile. Kai, who was stuck on three lands, couldn't answer Olivier's threats and when the Frenchman played a [Wanderguard Sentry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wanderguard+Sentry), a removal heavy hand was shown, with [Irradiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate) and two [Consume Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit)s in there. The German drew his fourth land, which enabled him to play out a [Goblin War Wagon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Wagon), but a [Predator's Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%27s+Strike) on Olivier's side made sure that it wouldn't survive combat.

Another [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) for Kai allowed him to start playing [Consume Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit)s on Olivier's creatures but [Wizard Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica) countered the first attempt. However, Olivier's [Wanderguard Sentry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wanderguard+Sentry) did fall to the next one. The Frenchman replenished his army with a Tel-Jihad Archers, and played out an Aether Spellbomb to deny Kai any of his creatures. A [Betrayal of Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal+of+Flesh) with entwine from Kai killed off the Archers and got back his War Wagon, but it wasn't enough as Olivier had an additional 2/2 to swarm him. 

**Final Result:** Ruel 2 – Budde 0
