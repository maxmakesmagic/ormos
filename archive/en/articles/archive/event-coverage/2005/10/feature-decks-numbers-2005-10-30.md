Six different archetypes made it into the Top 8, but those are just a few of the many decks played by a field of 340 at Pro Tour-Los Angeles. What this doesn’t tell us is which decks fared the best as a whole over the course of the Pro Tour. That’s where you have to do the numbers, which is what you see below.


The Average Points column listed is the average points of players running that archetype across the tournament. Fifteen or above means that the average player running that deck placed in Day Two of the event, which is pretty good. As always, beware of decks with fewer number of players because they could just be one guy having a very good weekend, while you could conclude that decks with a greater number of players and high averages did well against a diverse field of players.
