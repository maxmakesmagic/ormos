| T*ime Spiral*’s Thick-Skinned Goblin removes the drawback from echo creatures. But it also has a protection from red ability that keeps it around when it comes time to pay [Subterranean Shambler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Subterranean+Shambler)’s echo cost. That protection from red ability helped tie it to another goblin with activated pro-red: [Keeper of Kookus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeper+of+Kookus). |

Although goblins have [a distinctive look](/en/articles/archive/time-vs-goblins-2007-03-07) in *Time Spiral* Block, the art for [Thick-Skinned Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thick-Skinned+Goblin) bears a number of similarities to *Visions*’ [Keeper of Kookus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeper+of+Kookus).

What features can you see that they have in common?


* [Thick-Skinned Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thick-Skinned+Goblin) holds an iron rod in the fire that looks the same as [Keeper of Kookus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeper+of+Kookus)’s.
* [Thick-Skinned Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thick-Skinned+Goblin) lacks a nose, but you can see some familiar bushy eyebrows.
* Both have similar gloves and boots held dangerously close to a fire source
* Both have a certain toothiness to their grins.
* Check out the flavor text of [Keeper of Kookus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeper+of+Kookus).
