### Day 1 Format


* 2HG Sealed Deck (60 minute deck construction)
* 1 Time Spiral tournament pack, 1 Time Spiral booster, and 3 Planar Chaos boosters with which to build two, 40-card minimum decks
* If product is not stamped or preregistered, deck registration and deck swap will be performed for the day 1 Team Sealed Deck build.
* If the tournament will consist of more than 400 Registered Teams, the day 1 Sealed Deck may consist of 2 separate groups. As closely as possible, each group will consist of an equal number of teams, an equal number of teams from each bye level, and an equal number of Amateur-status teams. Each group will only play against other teams in their group.
* The number of day 1 Swiss rounds is not affected if the tournament is run in this manner -- each group plays a number of rounds based on the total effective attendance of both groups.

### Day 2 Format


* 2HG Booster draft (40 minute deck construction)
* 4 Time Spiral and 2 Planar Chaos booster packs will be used by each team for drafting.
* All teams use the same A/B player designations from Day 1.
* Day 2 competition will consist of 3 Booster drafts, each followed by 2 rounds of competition.

### Rounds (Number and Length)

| 257 - 512 | 8 |
| 513 - 1024 | 9 |
| 1025 or higher | 10 |

* The number of Swiss rounds on day 1 is determined by the following formula applied to the chart below: EFFECTIVE ATTENDANCE = REGISTRERED TEAMS +(1-round byes x .56) + (2-round byes x 2.38)
* Day 2 will have 6 Swiss rounds, followed by the single-elimination finals
* All Swiss rounds are 50 minutes in length; Top 4 single-elimination finals have no time limit
* When time is called, the active team will finish the turn and three (3) additional turns will be taken

### Advancement


* All teams may participate in the Day 1 Sealed Deck
* The top 64 teams will advance to Day 2
* The top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the top 8 single-elimination finals.
* The top 4 teams after the final Swiss round will advance to the top 4 single-elimination finals.

### Top 4


* Top 4 matches will be single game matches
* The Top 4 teams will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting.
* The Top 4 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* While there are no time limits in the Top 4, teams are expected to play at a reasonable pace and finish their matches within 60 minutes.
