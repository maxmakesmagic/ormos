 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 







The Great Lakes Regional team is the winning team of the first ever US Nationals Regional Team Competition. Despite not having anyone finish in the Top 16 they did manage remarkably consistent finishes across their Top 4 players narrowly edging out yesterday's leaders, the Mid Atlantic Region. Ken Lenhert (24 points), Chris Pait (22 points), Brandon Demes (21 points), and Jon Honea (18 points) narrowly edged out Mike McGee (24 points), Brad Taulbee (21 points), Jim Ferraiolo (21 points), and Joshua Merold (18 points) by a single point to earn the title.


For their efforts they—and their other four teammates—will each win a box of *Scourge*. The Great Lakes region was one of a surprising number of regions that actually fielded all eight team members. Great Lakes Region organizer Mike Guptil must be doing something right because his Ohio Valley Region placed third—with only four invitationalists in the tournament!


Congratulations Great Lakes Regional team!
