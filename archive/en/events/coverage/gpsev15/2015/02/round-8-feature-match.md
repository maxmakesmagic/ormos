Meeting this round with records of 7-1 were two of the most accomplished Spanish players of all time. Antonio Del Moral León had just become the first Spaniard to win a Pro Tour a week before, whereas Javier Dominguez had finished first and second at two Grand Prix last year.



The similarities didn't end with country, language, or notable finishes however. Both were also piloting the same deck: Mono-Green Devotion prominently featuring recent addition [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental).



**Game 1**



In true mirror-match fashion, both players began the game with [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). Dominguez deployed the first big threat in [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater), but that was easily outclassed by Del Moral León's [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) plus token retinue.



However, Dominguez's own [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) followed, as did [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental). Suddenly the tables had turned: Not only was Del Moral León facing an ever-growing army of creatures; there was also the little matter of [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) which, with the help of [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) and [Voyaging Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr), would likely grow truly monstrous soon and take a large part of Del Moral León's team with it to the grave.

Del Moral León didn't stick around to watch this fate play out; he conceded and proceeded to game two.

**Game 2**



Del Moral León was more lucky here, or rather Dominguez was less so. While the latter was stuck on one land without [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), Del Moral León summoned three [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic)s, [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker), and [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) in short order.



It was brutal and it was quick.



Javier Dominguez 1 – 1 Antonio Del Moral León



**Game 3**



That game, well, that escalated quickly. Del Moral León had the first play in [Voyaging Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr), Javier Dominguez did one better with [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), Del Moral León did one better yet and killed it via [Reclamation Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclamation+Sage) only to face Dominguez's [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater).



Del Moral León raised the stakes further and summoned [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental), but so did Dominguez. Still looking to go further Del Moral León cast [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker), untapped some Forests, and summoned [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen). Dominguez "only" had another [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental).



While Del Moral León manifested another [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental), Dominguez put his hopes on another Polukranos to deal with the incoming swarm of Insects that had gotten him down to 6 life already; without [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx), however, he could just take down three tokens and fell to 3. He survived the next swing thanks to [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and turned more of his creatures face-up, going up to a total four [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental)s!



Del Moral León wanted to have some part of such wackiness as well and cast [Genesis Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Hydra) for about a third of his library, found another [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen), and activated [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker)'s ultimate ability. He controlled more than thirty permanents now, and among them well enough fliers to take the game, when Dominguez's next turn still didn't provide him with an answer.
