Both players had achieved their first top 8 this weekend in Kyōto. Kai Thiele, the half-Japanese half-German player who moved to Japan only two months ago, made it in with his Ad Nasueam Storm deck. Armed with the power to win on the first turn, Thiele's Storm deck hoped to cast a number of [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual)s or [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual)s to generate mana and Storm, then use [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond) in conjunction with [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) to find a lethal [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) out of his deck.


His opponent, Yosuke Morinaga is an up-and-coming Japanese player. He was one of many players this weekend to decide on a [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) based deck. His version included Red and Black, which gave him access to disruptive cards such as [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction) along with the Blue-Red staples of Delver decks: [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), etc. Understanding the speed at which his opponent could win, Morinaga shuffled up and focused for the first game of the match


The Games
=========


Morinaga had an ideal opening: turn 1 [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) which transformed into [Insectile Aberration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) on the second turn.


Thiele didn't care about the silly 3/2. He cast [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) on his second turn. Even though Morinaga revealed [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) to [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), Thiele named [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will). [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) whiffed, but it revealed that the only piece of defense that Morinaga held was that [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze).

Thiele then continued to do what he had been doing all weekend: combo off.


He cast a flurry of rituals and [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal)s. Finally, he cast a [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond) then sacrificed it in response to his own [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor). When he searched his deck, he found a copy of [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony), which, by this point, was more than lethal.

 Morinaga brought more disruption for the second game; he started off game 1 with [Grafdigger's Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage) and followed it up with [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear)

Thiele spent his first two turns casting a number of single Blue mana cards: two [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s and a [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain).


Thiele continued the trend by casting [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) into [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) on his third turn and saw Morinaga had only [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction) and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) in his hand. He then decided to cast [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) on his opponent. In response, Morinaga used [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction) to remove [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and found a [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) off of his [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). Presuming the coast was clear, Thiele played the same combo he had last game: [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual), [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual), [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond), [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor), and [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony). In a few short turns Thiele found his way to the semifinals
