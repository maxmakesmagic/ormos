The **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings are back in full swing here in 2014, and another Pro-packed weekend has seen plenty of movement in the table, so let's get to it. 


[Sacramento, California](/en/events/coverage/martell-displays-mastery-theros-sacramento), hosted close to 1,900 players, all trying to navigate their way through *Theros* Sealed Deck, before the remaining hopefuls faced six more rounds of *Theros* Booster Draft on Day Two. With No. 1 Ben Stark analyzing all the action from the commentary booth, there was a chance for several of his rivals to close the gap. Among them was  [Pro Tour *Gatecrash*](/en/events/coverage/ptgtc13) Champion Tom Martell, who came into the weekend with 16 Pro Points this season, despite a relatively light travel schedule. As Day Two progressed, many of the most recognizable names fell by the wayside, but Martell kept on trucking. As the Top 8 were announced, it was clear that Martell had the edge on experience over all his rivals for the title. This was his fifth Grand Prix Top 8, and only Aaron Lewis of the other seven had seen final-table action before. 

 Martell duly took it down, adding a Limited title to his Constructed win from [Grand Prix Indianapolis](/en/events/coverage/martell%E2%80%99s-victory-lingers-indianapolis), and catapulting him up the rankings from No. 13 to No. 7, bypassing no fewer than three former Players of the Year in the process—Owen Turtenwald, Shuhei Nakamura, and Yuuya Watanabe. 

Other gains on the weekend were made by Paul Rietzl (up one to No. 16) and Brian Kibler (up one to No. 19), plus there were welcome returns to the rankings for Luis Scott-Vargas and Canada's Jon Stern, now at No. 24 and No. 25, respectively. David Sharfman and Christian Calcano make way, at least for the time being.

 Next up is a double-header, with Standard coming to Vancouver this weekend, while *Theros* Limited action heads to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. Join us next week to see who makes the next moves in the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings.
