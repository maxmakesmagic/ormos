Due to production delays, *Commander Collection: Green* will now release Dec.Â 4.


The delay is unfortunate, especially during the [Year of Commander](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/big-things-are-coming-commander-2020-2019-10-30). But it's been a year of many things, and this delay is unfortunately out of our control. We regret any inconvenience this may cause.
