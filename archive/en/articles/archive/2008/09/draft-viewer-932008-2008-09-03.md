The **magicthegathering.com** Draft Viewer is back, and this time there's a new twist: we can pull drafts from **Magic Online**! This week we've got the Top 8 *Shadowmoor* / *Shadowmoor* / *Eventide* draft from one of the recent Premier Events, and thanks to the Draft Viewer you'll get to see every aspect of the draft. Want to watch a single pack as it flies around the table or stick with one player to see what they picked? The Draft Viewer lets you see everything exactly as it went down.
