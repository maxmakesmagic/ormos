Patrick "Trick" Jarrett oversees web content and social media for Magic, and acts as the publisher of DailyMTG.com and Magic content on the web. He's an ardent Commander player and lover of the game he's played since Ice Age. 






A few weeks ago we announced who would be representing the community in the 2012 Community Cup. Today we announce what the formats are and what the stakes will be.


### Formats


* *Return to Ravnica* Sealed
* Cube Draft - With a cube list yet to be announced!
* *Ravnica* Unified Constructed – This is a constructed format using cards from the original Ravnica block (*Ravnica*, *Guildpact*, *Dissension*) and *Return to Ravnica*
* Multiball Wacky Draft – This will not be part of the central events, it is a side event of sorts. It is a zany draft format where drafters are required to follow specific rules as defined by our friends over at LoadingReadyRun. More will be shared about these down the road.

All matches will be played using the new *Magic Online* client currently in Wide Beta!


### The Stakes


If the Community Team wins, all players who log in to *Magic Online* during the Community Cup (between the downtime on Wednesday October 24 and Friday October 26 at 5:00 PM PT) will get one entry into a draft queue. What draft queue? You decide!


Note that the last option: *Innistrad* Block + *Avacyn Restored* is a never-before offered *Magic Online* draft format!


Whatever format wins, if the community team wins, that queue will be available for a week roughly a month after the Community Cup ends. The event will be a Phantom single-elimination draft queue, rather than a standard prize structure, every player will get a promo [Mwonvuli Beast Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mwonvuli+Beast+Tracker) and the winner of each queue will get a *Return to Ravnica* booster pack!


We'll tally the votes Monday morning, October 15, and announce the winning format along with the Wizards team that will be playing against the Community Team next week!


But... what if the Community Team loses? What if they are defeated and the streak is broken? They'll get a special 2012 Community Cup version of [Sorrow's Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorrow%27s+Path) in a modern frame.


No pressure Community Team, but you had better figure out how to deliver!
