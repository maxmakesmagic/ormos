Most of the time on Magic Arcana we don't show art [sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches:) of older cards, simply because a lot of the sketch art was not maintained in Multiverse (Wizards' internal card database) before *Odyssey*. Happily, however, some hard copies of older sketches survive around the WotC offices. Let's take a look at a couple. Can you recognize these cards from the sketch?
