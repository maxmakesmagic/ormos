 Bilbao is a city full of character—vibrant, vital and culturally dynamic with a rich and varied history. The Basque country's biggest and busiest city, Bilbao lies on Ría Nervión and is neatly wedged into the green hills of Vizcaya province. At its heart it is sliced in two by the murky waters of Ría de Bilbao, the Nervión's channel to the sea. 
 Today, Bilbao throngs with sophisticated locals and energetic tourists alike. Its cuisine is second to none and there's non-stop partying if you want to burn out in style. If culture is more your thing, you can't do better than the internationally renowned Guggenheim.


 Join us for a weekend of **Magic**: The Gathering in one of Spain's greatest cities! 




 *The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#2013).*

 The main tournament at Grand Prix Bilbao is open to **Magic**  players of all ages. 


 Players must have a signed publicity release form to be included in Wizards of the Coast's official online event coverage. Forms can be downloaded [here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/publicityrelease_grandprix_2011.pdf) (15k PDF) and will be available onsite. Minors must have a parent or guardian’s signature on this form. Publicity releases will be collected during registration. 



**Tournament Format**
  


* [Modern](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrmodern)
* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day 2 that they used on Day 1.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).


**Judges**
  
 The Head Judges for Grand Prix Bilbao are Frank Wareman and Jurgen Baert. Judges interested in working at this event should submit an application through the **Magic** judge website ([apps.magicjudges.org](http://apps.magicjudges.org)).
