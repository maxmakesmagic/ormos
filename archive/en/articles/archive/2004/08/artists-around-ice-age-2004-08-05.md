*Ice Age* was released over nine years ago, but many of **Magic**'s veteran artists have been going strong all that time. These artist old-timers (as we lovingly refer to them) bring amazing consistency, experience and creativity to the look of **Magic**, and some of them are highlighted in today's Arcana. Take a peek at a few samples of their work from then and now.
