People always joke about how much I mention “[Roseanne](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-roseanne).” You know what I mention about three times more? *A Whack on the Side of the Head* by Roger von Oech, my favorite book of all time and the best book on creative thinking. There is also a sequel called *A Kick In The Seat Of The Pants*. The sequel is not quite as good as the original but then [*Empire Strikes Back*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-empire) is not as good as *Star Wars* and is still one of the best movies of all time. 


If you care at all about creativity, then read both books. And once you do, write to me and tell me what you think. Regardless of if you [love it or hate it](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-love), I'd like to hear. And one last time, I swear I'm not getting any cutback from the author. It's a book that changed my life. You want to find ways to be more creative? Read it.
