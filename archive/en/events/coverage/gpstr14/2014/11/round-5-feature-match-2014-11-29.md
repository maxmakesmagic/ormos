[_metadata_:description]:- "Meeting this round with perfect records of 4-0 were No. 5-ranked Ivan Floch and Humberto Patarca.

Meeting this round with perfect records of 4-0 were No. 5-ranked Ivan Floch and Humberto Patarca. Patarca may have one previous Grand Prix Top 8, a finals appearance even, but his accomplishments were still no match for Floch's. With four Top 8s at Grand Prix and two at the Pro Tour, including one win at each, Floch's résumé left no doubt as to who was the favorite in this encounter.


Floch had built a green-blue-red Temur deck, Patarca brought Jeskai with mostly blue and red cards and just a small splash of white.


Game 1
======



 In the first game, Floch launched a relentless assault: [Smoke Teller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smoke+Teller), morph, another morph, [Bring Low](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bring+Low). Also being brought low—on life—was Patarca.
