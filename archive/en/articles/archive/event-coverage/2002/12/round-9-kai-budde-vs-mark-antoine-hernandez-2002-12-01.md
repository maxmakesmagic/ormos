![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a939.jpg)Last round of the day and again Kai Budde is in a situation where a loss would dump him out of the tournament. At 7-2 the German superstar needs to win to advance into day two. Budde is running The Rock, splashing red for [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate). His opponent Mark Antoine Hernandez is running a more old-school version of the same deck.

Budde won the die roll and elected to go first.

His opponent got in the first [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and stripped [Living Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) from Budde's hand. From there it was a steady build up of [Birds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds), [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village)s and the usual Rock suspects.

"Yes, it's the stupid mirror," said as he summoned a [Yavimaya Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder).

Budde Therapied for a [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger) only to find Hernandez was running older school Rock with [Deranged Hermit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Hermit). Budde summoned [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) then sacked it to Therapy away the Hermit.

Hernandez got in a swipe for 8 but Budde cast first one [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger), then another, and with [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) in the graveyard looked to be in control.

Hernandez wasn't to be outdone as he tutored for [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) and started a squirrel factory going with the [Deranged Hermit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Hermit). The two [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger)s no longer looked quite so impressive.

All Budde could do was get back and summon a [Yavimaya Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder). If he didn't have a [Diabolic Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) Hernandez could attack and kill him. Hernandez didn't see this and instead chose to overplay a little by generating a ton of squirrels. This left the German an out if he could draw [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed). He didn't and was run over by the [Squirrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel) Horde.

Hernandez 1-0 Budde

Budde thought about it and chose to play. He looked at his hand and was forced to throw it straight back. Hernandez also decided to do the same.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a941.jpg)Hernandez missed with his first [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), but then took out a Baloth with his second. Budde hit with a [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), but that plan was scuppered as Hernandez dropped his own Baloth.

A [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) took out the [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) from Budde's hand and after he lost both [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and Elder gang-blocking the Baloth the German was left with only land.

A second Elder netted a few cards as Budde looked to find answers to Hernandez's [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger). [Living Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death) seemed appropriate although a Deed from Hernandez returned parity. By this point Budde had drawn something like 8 lands out of his deck with Elders, leaving nothing but good stuff.

A [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) found Budde [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) and he used it to great advantage by putting [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger), [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) and [Filth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filth) into his graveyard. No longer able to block Hernandez looked in real trouble.

Budde started to get back his monsters and bashed Hernandez about a bit. Hernandez resolved [Living Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death), but as Budde could sacrifice all his monsters in play all it achieved was to pull [Filth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filth) out of the graveyard and into play where it was far less dangerous.

Time was starting to become a factor with only ten minutes left. A draw would do Budde no good and he was still 1-0 down.

He sacrificed his elders to find an answer. He found a deed and wiped the board of everything except his two Mongers and [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis). Hernandez held on for a turn but succumbed soon afterwards.

Hernandez 1-1 Budde

With only 6 minutes remaining a draw would do neither player any good. As both were playing the Rock any kind of quick result seemed unlikely. Budde didn't seem to have any forests but a [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) quickly loaded his graveyard with [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) and two Baloth.

Meanwhile Hernandez got a recurring nightmare going to dig some land out of his deck with an Elder.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a942.jpg)Budde dropped a [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger), hoping for some kind of quick kill. [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) left him with no hand but [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) was lurking in his graveyard to keep a steady stream of monsters.

Time was called with Budde needing to do thirteen damage. He had an unblockable [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger) but Hernandez kept recursing Baloth with [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) to stay out of danger.

A missed [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) revealed Hernandez was also holding two Deeds. With only a few extra turns remaining it looked very tough for the German juggernaut.

Hernandez had plans for day 2 of his own. He attacked with Baloth and [Phyrexian Plaguelord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Plaguelord) to drop Budde to 8 and then summoned [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) to bring the match to an exciting finale.

3rd Extra turn and Budde got back a [Ravenous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) with [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis). An attack with [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger) knocked Hernandez to 1.

4th Extra turn and Hernandez ripped [Coffin Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coffin+Purge) off the top, stripping both [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) and [Filth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filth) from Budde's graveyard.

5th extra turn and now Budde couldn't win. [Living Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) brought [Filth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filth) back into the game, but not into the graveyard where it was needed. Hernandez had enough creatures to block and the game seemed certain to end in a draw that would knock both players out.

A player could concede but they couldn't discuss this or use another method to determine the outcome so with resignation Budde marked the sheet 1-1, signed it and handed it to Hernandez. Hernandez chose not to sign it and instead spontaneously conceded to Budde. The Juggernaut had been handed a lifeline and would be competing in day two after all!

**Final Result:** Kai Budde beat Mark Antoine Hernandez 2-1
