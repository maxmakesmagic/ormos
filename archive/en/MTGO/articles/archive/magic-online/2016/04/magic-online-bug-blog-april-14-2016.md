*Shadows over Innistrad* Known Issues
-------------------------------------





**Gameplay**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Status | Description | Format |
| Newly Added | If damage caused by [Angel of Deliverance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Deliverance) also causes its controller to reach delirium, its ability can incorrectly trigger. | Standard, Limited |
| Newly Added | [Odric, Lunarch Marshal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Odric%2C+Lunarch+Marshal)'s triggered ability ignores the hexproof ability on a creature if it only has it temporarily. | Standard, Limited |
| Newly Added | The game log text for [Creeping Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Dread) duplicates the name of the discarded card on a second line. | Standard, Limited |
| Newly Added | When some cards with madness are discarded, the triggered ability does not display its madness cost while on the stack. Players can find this information by right-clicking the card or by viewing the game log. | Cardset (General) |
| Newly Added | Lands enchanted by [Weirding Wood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weirding+Wood) incorrectly display five mana abilities instead of one. | Standard, Limited |
| Newly Added | Abilities that trigger from a permanent becoming the target of a spell or ability (such as that of [Silverfur Partisan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverfur+Partisan)) are not triggered by copies of spells automatically put onto the stack. For example: if a player controls [Zada, Hedron Grinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zada%2C+Hedron+Grinder) and casts a spell on Zada, when Zada's triggered ability resolves, the player will be prompted to choose targets for the copies made by Zada. If the player chooses targets for the copies individually, [Silverfur Partisan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverfur+Partisan)'s ability will trigger correctly. If the player clicks OK to automatically choose the targets, the Partisan's ability won't trigger. | Standard |
| Newly Added | [Fork in the Road](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fork+in+the+Road) fails to display the destination zones of the chosen lands in the game log. | Standard, Limited |
| Newly Added | [Tooth Collector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+Collector)'s triggered ability incorrectly displays a [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) button while the player is prompted to choose a target. | Standard, Limited |
| Newly Added | [Infectious Curse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infectious+Curse) provides no indication as to which player has been cursed. | Standard, Limited |
| Newly Added | If Heir of Falkenrath’s ability is used to transform it into [Heir to the Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+to+the+Night), then it transforms back into [Heir of Falkenrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+Falkenrath) in the same turn in some way, its activated ability can be used again. | Standard, Limited |
| Newly Added | Cards from *Shadows over Innistrad* are incorrectly illegal in the Freeform Vanguard format. | General |
| Newly Added | [Ever After](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ever+After) resolves immediately upon selection of the second target instead of allowing the player to click a Done button. | Standard, Limited |
| Newly Added | [Creeping Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Dread)’s triggered ability will incorrectly cause all opponents to lose 3 life if any of them had no cards in hand when it resolved. | Standard, Limited |

Change Log
----------





Newly Added Known Issues
========================


**Cardset**


* Cardset | Abilities added to double-faced planeswalkers cause the third loyalty ability, not the gained ability, to display over the art.
* Cardset | Abilities that trigger from a permanent becoming the target of a spell or ability (such as that of [Silverfur Partisan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverfur+Partisan)) are not triggered by copies of spells automatically put onto the stack. For example: if a player controls [Zada, Hedron Grinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zada%2C+Hedron+Grinder) and casts a spell on Zada, when Zada's triggered ability resolves, the player will be prompted to choose targets for the copies made by Zada. If the player chooses targets for the copies individually, [Silverfur Partisan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverfur+Partisan)'s ability will trigger correctly. If the player clicks OK to automatically choose the targets, the Partisan's ability won't trigger.
* Cardset | Cards from *Shadows over Innistrad* are incorrectly illegal in the Freeform Vanguard format.
* Cardset | Collector numbers can appear misaligned on full-art promo cards.
* Cardset | Creatures with a protection ability incorrectly display that ability twice.
* Cardset | [Creeping Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Dread)’s triggered ability will incorrectly cause all opponents to lose 3 life if any of them had no cards in hand when it resolved.
* Cardset | Enter-the-battlefield triggered abilities granted to creatures (such as by [Dormant Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dormant+Sliver) or [Clash of Realities](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clash+of+Realities)) fail to trigger.
* Cardset | [Ever After](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ever+After) resolves immediately upon selection of the second target instead of allowing the player to click a Done button.
* Cardset | [Fork in the Road](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fork+in+the+Road) fails to display the destination zones of the chosen lands in the game log.
* Cardset | If a creature enters the battlefield and then gains haste, it no longer indicates that it entered the battlefield that turn.
* Cardset | If a player activates an ability that requires tapping an untapped creature as part of the cost (such as a cohort ability), the creature incorrectly cannot be tapped to activate that ability again until either a second turn has gone by or another spell is cast. For example: A player controls both [Spawnbinder Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbinder+Mage) and [Affa Protector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Affa+Protector) and taps both to activate [Spawnbinder Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbinder+Mage)'s ability. On that player's next turn, the [Affa Protector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Affa+Protector) is unable to tap to activate the Mage's ability unless a spell has been cast between the activations.
* Cardset | If a player casts [Corpse Churn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Churn) and chooses not to return a creature to their hand, the game log fails to display that choice.
* Cardset | If a player is unable to draw a card (perhaps thanks to [Spirit of the Labyrinth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+of+the+Labyrinth)), that player can incorrectly still choose to take the impossible action of drawing a card during the resolution of a spell or ability. Notably, this is unfortunate with abilities that have players draw a card, then discard a card such as [Salvage Drone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salvage+Drone).
* Cardset | If damage caused by [Angel of Deliverance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Deliverance) also causes its controller to reach delirium, its ability can incorrectly trigger.
* Cardset | If Heir of Falkenrath’s ability is used to transform it into [Heir to the Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+to+the+Night), then it transforms back into [Heir of Falkenrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+Falkenrath) in the same turn in some way, its activated ability can be used again.
* Cardset | [Infectious Curse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infectious+Curse) provides no indication as to which player has been cursed.
* Cardset | Lands enchanted by [Weirding Wood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weirding+Wood) incorrectly display five mana abilities instead of one.
* Cardset | [Makeshift Mannequin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mannequin) fails to give the returned creature the triggered ability described in its rules text.
* Cardset | [Odric, Lunarch Marshal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Odric%2C+Lunarch+Marshal)'s triggered ability ignores the hexproof ability on a creature if it only has it temporarily.
* Cardset | Some spells that deal damage with the potential to exile the damaged creature when it dies this turn (such as [Anger of the Gods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods)) display additional text in the game log.
* Cardset | The game log text for [Creeping Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Dread) duplicates the name of the discarded card on a second line.
* Cardset | The triggered ability from [Narset Transcendent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset+Transcendent)’s second loyalty ability incorrectly grants rebound to a spell cast from a zone other than the hand.
* Cardset | [Tooth Collector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+Collector)'s triggered ability incorrectly displays a [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) button while the player is prompted to choose a target.
* Cardset | When a double-faced creature is copied by a non-token creature, the copy is incorrectly resistant to effects that would turn it face down, such as [Ixidron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=389565)’s triggered ability. Only double-faced cards cannot be turned face down.
* Cardset | [World Queller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Queller)’s triggered ability occasionally causes the game to restart.
* Cardset | [Wretched Confluence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Confluence) will only cause a player to draw a single card, regardless of how many times they were the target of its first mode.

**Client and Gameplay**


* Duel Scene | In certain circumstances, delayed triggers do not always display in the Effects area.
* Duel Scene | Split cards incorrectly display with a red border while on the stack.
* Duel Scene | When some cards with madness are discarded, the triggered ability does not display its madness cost while on the stack. Players can find this information by right-clicking the card or by viewing the game log.
* Trade | A player changing a trade proposal now fails to cause the Submit button on the player's trade partner's trade window to flash.

Fixes Deployed With April 13 Build
==================================


The below are known issues that were fixed as part of the April 13 [deployment](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-announcements-april-12-2016#buildnotes).


**Cardset**


* [Hunting Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Wilds), when kicked, now properly untaps Forest cards that were put onto the battlefield tapped during its resolution.

**Client and Gameplay**


* Duel Scene | Players are now able to single click, double click, or right click cards to split them into piles when prompted to do so by a card like [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) or [Epiphany at the Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Epiphany+at+the+Drownyard).
* Trade | If either trade partner adds or removes items from a trade after one of the partners clicked Submit, the submission will now be reset and both players must again click the Submit button before the trade can proceed to the final confirmation window.
* Trade | Clicking an empty space during a trade now properly deselects cards.
* Deckbuilding | While building a Limited deck, adding basic lands will no longer undo sorting by converted mana cost or color.

New Workarounds
===============


* *Magic Origins* Planeswalkers used as Commanders will not return to the battlefield after exiling themselves. WORKAROUND: Players can avoid this issue by making sure the “Exile zone, not command zone” option is selected.

| Ongoing | Casting [Land Grant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land+Grant) for its alternative cost fails to reveal the caster's hand. | Cardset (Legacy, Commander) |
| Ongoing | Players can use the undo function (default: Ctrl+Z) to discard one card instead of two during the resolution of [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), [Compulsive Research](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research), or [Mystic Meditation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Meditation). | Cardset (Legacy, Modern, Commander) |
| Ongoing | Several prompt boxes are incorrect or uninformative. Affected cards include [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet), [Harvester Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harvester+Troll), and [Devour in Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Flames). | Cardset (Standard, Limited) |

| Ongoing | [Eldrazi Spawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Spawn) and Scions created by cards from the *Battle for Zendikar* and *Rise of the Eldrazi* sets display "Add {1} to your mana pool" instead of "Add {C} to your mana pool" upon zoom. As this change in template was not a functional change, these tokens continue to function correctly. | Cardset (Standard, Limited, Modern) |
| Ongoing | [Soulflayer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulflayer) fails to gain abilities from creature cards exiled to pay its mana cost with the delve ability. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | Cards that require a player to remove any number of +1/+1 counters (such as [Retribution of the Ancients](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retribution+of+the+Ancients) or [Ooze Flux](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ooze+Flux)) incorrectly do not allow a player to remove any counters. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | If [Kozilek's Pathfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Pathfinder) loses its abilities (perhaps it was given a [Gift of Tusks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Tusks)), creatures previously affected by its activated ability will incorrectly be able to block it. | Cardset (Limited) |
| Ongoing | [Thousand-Year Elixir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thousand-Year+Elixir)'s static ability allowing creatures to activate abilities as though they had haste does not function. | Cardset (Commander, Legacy) |
| Ongoing | Using the first activated ability of [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) while an opponent has only one card in hand causes the game to lock until the player who controls [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) passes priority. | Cardset (Modern, Legacy) |
| Ongoing | [Harbinger of the Tides](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbinger+of+the+Tides)'s casting options are displayed incorrectly. Players can still pay [Harbinger of the Tides](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbinger+of+the+Tides)'s alternative casting cost by selecting the lower "Cast" option from the menu that appears when the card is clicked. | Cardset (Modern and Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Crumble to Dust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumble+to+Dust) incorrectly causes the player to search the library of the land's controller, not owner | Cardset (Modern and Standard) |
| Ongoing | Non-creature permanents destroyed the turn after an Equipment unattaches from them still cause the "when equipped creature dies" triggers of the Equipment to occur. For example, a [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) with a [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) attached when [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) uses its ability to become a creature will still allow a player to draw two cards even if [Sarkhan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386650) is destroyed as a planeswalker on the following turn. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Mass Polymorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Polymorph) incorrectly does not count exiled creature tokens when determining how many creature cards to put onto the battlefield. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | When a player casts [Kozilek, the Great Distortion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+the+Great+Distortion), its triggered ability incorrectly triggers if the casting player has seven or more cards in hand. Upon resolution, the player will not draw cards if he or she already has seven or more cards in hand. | Cardset (Commander, Legacy, Modern, and Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Villainous Wealth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth)'s prompt box text incorrectly suggests that the caster must cast all appropriate exiled spells. This is a display issue only. The cancel button allows the player to continue without casting remaining spells. | Cardset (Commander and Standard) |
| Ongoing | The game log does not display the third choice of a [Confluence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confluence). | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | [Evolutionary Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolutionary+Leap) does not appropriately add cards revealed by its activated ability to the Revealed Cards area.  | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Void Winnower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) incorrectly prohibits players from casting spells that have both an even converted mana cost and a variable in the mana cost. For example, a player whose opponent controls a [Void Winnower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) is incorrectly prohibited from casting [Rolling Thunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Thunder) or [Nourishing Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nourishing+Shoal), even if the value chosen for X would result in a spell with an odd converted mana cost. Even if a player cannot even, they should be able to odd. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | Cards that are exiled by [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) incorrectly show association arrows while in the Exiled Zone. | Cardset (Commander, Legacy, Modern, and Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Cavern of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls)'s second ability can incorrectly be used to cast face-down creatures of the chosen creature type.  | Cardset (Legacy and Modern) |
| Ongoing | [Myriad Landscape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myriad+Landscape)'s activated ability incorrectly allows a player to put two basic lands that do not share a land type onto the battlefield. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | Zooming in on a card exiled by [a land with Hideaway](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5bhideaway%5d) shows an additional basic swamp. This is a visual-only bug, players cannot play the swamp using Hideaway. WORKAROUND: Right clicking on the exiled show will display it properly.  | Cardset (Legacy) |
| Ongoing | Under rare circumstances, a player who controls two creatures that can't attack alone (such as [Bonded Construct](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Construct)) but must attack with one of them will be able to attack with only that creature rather than being required to attack with both. | Cardset (General) |
| Ongoing | When [Entreat the Angels](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) is on the stack with 0 chosen for X, the blue text that typically indicates the value of X does not appear. | Cardset (Legacy) |
| Ongoing | [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) incorrectly allows a player to redirect spells or abilities to the [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), even if it's no longer on the battlefield. | Cardset (Modern) |
| Ongoing | *Magic Origins* Planeswalkers used as Commanders will not return to the battlefield after exiling themselves. WORKAROUND: Players can avoid this issue by making sure the “Exile zone, not command zone” option is selected. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | Copying [All Suns' Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Suns%27+Dawn) sometimes causes a crash. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | Spells that target [Thunderbreak Regent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) more than once incorrectly trigger [Thunderbreak Regent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent)'s ability twice. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | Spells with multiple targets (such as [Silumgar's Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Command), [Agony Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), etc.) sometimes lack visual indicators to show what is happening to each target. | Cardset (General) |
| Ongoing | [Atarka's Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command)'s first activated ability doesn't appear in the Effect zone after it resolves. | Cardset (Modern and Standard) |
| Ongoing | Conceding while looking at cards with [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) reveals cards to opponent. | Cardset (Legacy and Vintage) |
| Ongoing | [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) lacks visual indicators during targeting to show whether or not it is targeting a player. | Cardset (Limited) |
| Ongoing | [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) reveals one too many cards from the top of the library after casting [Genesis Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Wave) or similar spells. | Cardset (Modern) |
| Ongoing | Cards cast with conspire that require a player to sacrifice a creature as an additional cost to cast, such as [Life's Legacy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life%27s+Legacy) and [Momentous Fall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentous+Fall), incorrectly look at the power and toughness of the last creature clicked for conspire. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | [The Chain Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) does not allow planeswalkers that enter the battlefield after activating [The Chain Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) to use their abilities twice.  | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | When you play a Ravnica shock land (such as [Hallowed Fountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain)) off the top of the library with [Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), the new top card of the library is incorrectly revealed before you decide whether to pay 2 life.  | Cardset (Modern) |
| Ongoing | Casting [Sylvan Primordial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordial) causes the game to be locked in a multiplayer game if there are no legal targets for one player. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | Abilities that generate replacement effects preventing specific cards from being put into graveyards (such as those found on [Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) or [Blightsteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus)) do not function properly while resolving [Grenzo, Dungeon Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grenzo%2C+Dungeon+Warden)'s activated ability. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that had a choice made as it entered (such as [Door of Destinies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) or [Painter's Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant)), the copy correctly allows the controller to make a new choice, but the abilities of the copy that refer to that choice do not function correctly. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | In certain circumstances, [Chandra, Flamecaller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) incorrectly exiles creature tokens created by [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). | Cardset (Limited and Standard) |
| Ongoing | If [Deceiver of Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+of+Form)'s triggered ability turns creatures into copies of a Legendary creature, the legend rule fails to apply to the copies. | Cardset (Commander, Limited, and Standard) |
| Ongoing | The mana abilities of [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) and [Kozilek's Translator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Translator) cannot be activated while paying the mana cost of a spell or ability. Players can still activate these abilities at any time that player has priority. | Cardset (Modern and Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Reality Smasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher)'s triggered ability incorrectly triggers once for each time a spell targets it. For example, if a player's opponent casts [Agony Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), choosing [Reality Smasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher) for both targets, the triggered ability will trigger twice instead of once. | Cardset (Modern and Standard) |
| Ongoing | If a creature enchanted by [Visions of Brutality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions+of+Brutality) fights another creature (say, due to some [Unnatural Aggression](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unnatural+Aggression)), and is dealt lethal damage this way, the enchanted creature incorrectly does not deal damage to its controller. | Cardset (Limited) |
| Ongoing | [Goldmeadow Harrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow+Harrier) incorrectly prevents players from submitting or playing with a Pauper deck.  | Cardset (Pauper) |
| Ongoing | [Phyrexian Devourer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Devourer) doesn't actually gain +1/+1 counters from its activated ability, no matter how many cards it devours. | Cardset (Legacy) |
| Ongoing | If a player attempts to sacrifice a pile of Eldrazi babies (Scions or Spawn) at once, only one of those tokens will be sacrificed. | Cardset (Limited, Modern, and Standard) |
| Ongoing | If a player casts [Predict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predict) or [Foreshadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foreshadow), accurately naming one name of a split card (such as [Fire // Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+%2F%2F+Ice)) put into the graveyard by the spell, the player will only draw one card instead of two. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | [Hallowed Moonlight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Moonlight) incorrectly fails to prevent [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet) from creating [Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie) tokens. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | Cardset | If [Vesuva](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva) copies a land with a static ability and then is later turned into a basic land (perhaps by a [Blood Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) or [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas)), that static ability will not be removed. Triggered and activated abilities are correctly removed. | Cardset (Modern) |
| Newly Added | A player changing a trade proposal now fails to cause the Submit button on the player's trade partner's trade window to flash. | Trade |
| Newly Added | Collector numbers can appear misaligned on full-art promo cards.  | Duel Scene |
| Newly Added | If a player is unable to draw a card (perhaps thanks to [Spirit of the Labyrinth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+of+the+Labyrinth)), that player can incorrectly still choose to take the impossible action of drawing a card during the resolution of a spell or ability. Notably, this is unfortunate with abilities that have players draw a card, then discard a card such as [Salvage Drone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salvage+Drone).  | Cardset (Legacy) |
| Newly Added | If a player activates an ability that requires tapping an untapped creature as part of the cost (such as a cohort ability), the creature incorrectly cannot be tapped to activate that ability again until either a second turn has gone by or another spell is cast. For example: A player controls both [Spawnbinder Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbinder+Mage) and [Affa Protector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Affa+Protector) and taps both to activate [Spawnbinder Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbinder+Mage)'s ability. On that player's next turn, the [Affa Protector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Affa+Protector) is unable to tap to activate the Mage's ability unless a spell has been cast between the activations.  | Cardset (General) |
| Newly Added | Abilities added to double-faced planeswalkers cause the third loyalty ability, not the gained ability, to display over the art.  | Cardset (General) |
| Newly Added | When some cards with madness are discarded, the triggered ability does not display the madness cost while on the stack. Players can find this information by right-clicking the card or by viewing the game log.  | Duel Scene |
| Newly Added | If a creature enters the battlefield and then gains haste, it no longer indicates that it entered the battlefield that turn.  | Cardset (General) |
| Newly Added | Creatures with a protection ability incorrectly display that ability twice.  | Cardset (General) |
| Newly Added | Split cards incorrectly display with a red border while on the stack.  | Cardset (General) |
| Newly Added | Cards from *Shadows over Innistrad* are incorrectly illegal in the Freeform Vanguard format.  | Cardset (General) |
| Newly Added | In certain circumstances, delayed triggers do not always display in the Effects area.  | Cardset (General) |
| Newly Added | When a double-faced creature is copied by a non-token creature, the copy is incorrectly resistant to effects that would turn it face down, such as [Ixidron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=389565)’s triggered ability. Only double-faced cards cannot be turned face down.  | Cardset (Commander) |
| Newly Added | Enter-the-battlefield triggered abilities granted to creatures (such as by [Dormant Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dormant+Sliver) or [Clash of Realities](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clash+of+Realities)) fail to trigger.  | Cardset (General) |
| Newly Added | Some spells that deal damage with the potential to exile the damaged creature when it dies this turn (such as [Anger of the Gods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods)) display additional text in the game log.  | Cardset (General) |
| Fixed | Players are now able to single click, double click, or right click cards to split them into piles when prompted to do so by a card like [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) or [Epiphany at the Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Epiphany+at+the+Drownyard). | Duel Scene |
| Fixed | If either trade partner adds or removes items from a trade after one of the partners clicked Submit, the submission will now be reset and both players must again click the Submit button before the trade can proceed to the final confirmation window. | Trade |
| Fixed | Clicking an empty space during a trade now properly deselects cards.  | Trade |
| Fixed | While building a Limited deck, adding basic lands will no longer undo sorting by converted mana cost or color. | Deckbuilding (Limited: Draft and Sealed) |
| Ongoing | Emblems display with an extra border. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Challenging a player directly does not allow the player to set Wins Per Match or Match Clock options. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | The Search Tool is not present in the Other Products tab of a trade | Trade |
| Ongoing | Dropping out of a game does not concede the game if the player is not the first one to drop out | Duel Scene (Commander) |
| Ongoing | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out. WORKAROUND: If a player suspects this is happening, logging out and back in may resolve the problem. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | When objects are added to a player's collection, the window displaying these objects incorrectly defaults to sorting them alphabetically and not by type of object. This keeps booster packs earned as prizes from being immediately seen. | Collection |
| Ongoing | Under rare circumstances, the Game Details window will display buttons to replay matches instead of a round timer or standings. As a temporary workaround, logging out and back in resolves the issue. | Play Lobby |
| Ongoing | Extra cards are sometimes added to a player's deck in addition to their choices when sideboarding. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | In certain rare circumstances, the window that displays at the end of an event does not display all prizes that the player has earned. This is a display issue only. All prizes are correctly added to players' collections in these situations.  | Collection |
| Ongoing | Land cards that use the multicolor land frame but do not have mana symbols in their rules text do not appear when filtering to display colorless cards. These lands do appear when filtering for land cards, however. | Collection  |
| Ongoing | Windows 10 may display an error message that *Magic Online* is an unrecognized application while downloading the client. In order to successfully download the client, click the "More Info" link, then "Run Anyway." | General |
| Ongoing | If a player's spell or ability causes his or her own cards to be revealed, those cards are incorrectly not added to the player's own Revealed Cards area. The player's opponent should still see the revealed cards correctly. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Creatures that enter the battlefield with counters based on the number of creatures in the graveyard (for example, [Undergrowth Scavenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undergrowth+Scavenger)) do not count themselves if they are put onto the battlefield directly from the graveyard. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | It is visually difficult to tell which set of blockers an attacking player is ordering when ordering multiple sets of multiple blocking creatures. WORKAROUND: You must start by ordering blockers for the left most attacking creature, then hit OK to move on to the next attacking creature to the right. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | When face down cards are given an activated ability, the art displays incorrectly on the stack when that ability is activated. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Duel Scene | Under certain rare scenarios, attacking creatures will display on the opponent's side of the battlefield. Resizing the Magic Online game window resolves this display issue. | General  |
| Ongoing | When casting a spell, if there is any mana already in the player's pool, the most recently produced colored mana is automatically applied to the spell first. For example, if a player taps a [Cavern of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) (naming [Human](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Human)), then an Island, then casts [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), the blue mana applied to the Delver's mana cost will be that from the Island. If the player tapped the Island, then the Cavern, the Cavern's mana would be applied to the spell, and it would be appropriately uncounterable. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Abilities that reduce mana costs are not correctly being applied to additional costs (such as buyback or multikicker). | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | While paying the mana cost for a card with delve, players cannot remove cards from the delve selection without canceling the casting process and starting over. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Cards that ask a player to choose X targets, such as [Glimpse the Sun God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Sun+God), briefly indicate incorrectly that X is equal to zero when the last potential target is chosen before moving on to the cost payment step. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Cards that search for multiple cards at once don't show the cards properly in the Revealed Cards area. WORKAROUND: The cards are properly identified in the game log. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Unusual mana in a player's pool, such as mana from a snow permanent or mana with a rider attached (as that produced by [Cavern of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls)) cannot be applied to a cost by clicking it. As a temporary workaround, players should produce this mana during the cost payment step in which they want to spend that mana. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | If a player makes a selection, then reverses that selection with the "undo" keyboard shortcut (default: CTRL+Z), the game log will sometimes incorrectly show both cards the player selected. Notably, this includes [Oath of Nissa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) and similar effects that ask a player to put one of a small number of cards into their hand. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | In certain rare scenarios, a bug may cause a game to restart. If this occurs, errors in the restarted game may cause cards to appear with incorrect watermarks, lands not appearing on the battlefield, or other visual issues. If you experience this issue, please contact Game Support.  | Duel Scene |
