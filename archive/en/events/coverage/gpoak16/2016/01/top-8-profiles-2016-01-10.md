**![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/gpoak16/t8_lingelbach.jpg)Name:** Cody Lingelbach


**Age:** 23


**Occupation:** Card game dealer


**Hometown:** Portland, Oregon


**Previous Magic accomplishments**: Multiple StarCityGames.com Open Top 8s; a bunch of Grand Prix Day 2s.


**What deck did you play and why?** Mardu Thopters. The format is full of removal so making thopters is insane.


**What sideboard card was the most important against the field? Why?** All of them. No one individual card overperformed.


**What *Oath of the Gatewatch* card are you most excited about? Why?**  

I haven’t looked at the spoiler. Did they reprint [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls)?


**Living or dead, who’s your dream Two-Headed Giant teammate? Why?**  

Brian Weller-Gordon.

**![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/gpoak16/t8_sinclair.jpg)Name:** Brett Sinclair


**Age:** 24


**Occupation:** Environmental engineer/specialist


**Hometown:** Orange


**Previous Magic accomplishments:** Nothing huge. A couple PPTQ and a first-place Grand Prix Trial finish.


**What deck did you play and why?**  

4C [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors). I was in on the deck shortly after the Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*. It does really busted stuff and has a ton of versatility and decision making.


**What sideboard card was the most important against the field? Why?**  
[Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut). That card is great and saves you versus [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) and Red combo.


**What *Oath of the Gatewatch* card are you most excited about? Why?**  

Logic-Knot Seer. It’s hard to say if colorless cards will be constructed playable, but “Vendilion Clique 2.0” looks sweet.


**Living or dead, who’s your dream Two-Headed Giant teammate? Why?**  

Attila the Hun. He’d scare my opponents into an easy concession. GG. Eh. Probably LSV. He has a good attitude and seems to go deep and know about everything.

**What sideboard card was the most important against the field? Why?**  

Rending Volley—killing [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master) Jace, Vryn’s Prodigy and [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai).

Basic Land – Wastes. It’s just cool!

**Hometown:** Omaha, Nebraska + Houston, Texas!


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Top 8 Grand Prix Dallas 2015; MOCS competitor 2015; 29th Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*  

A whole lot of Grand Prix Top 16s. Silver Pro statues (last season, and guaranteed this season!)


**What deck did you play and why?**  

Abzan with an updated mana base because I couldn’t find a reason not to play it. Oh, I cut all the two drops for more removal.


**What sideboard card was the most important against the field? Why?**  
[Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). All four. No regrets. Why? Because you take the card that beats you!


**What *Oath of the Gatewatch* card are you most excited about? Why?**  

Matter Reshaper because it’s an exciting effect.


**Living or dead, who’s your dream Two-Headed Giant teammate? Why?**

**Age:** 26


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Iowa City, Iowa


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Grand Prix Detroit Champion


**What deck did you play and why?**  
[Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors), the deck just feels like the most powerful and resilient deck in the format by a mile.


**What sideboard card was the most important against the field? Why?**  
[Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut). Killing [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) is so important.


**What *Oath of the Gatewatch* card are you most excited about? Why?**  

The 3/3 [Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash) that when it enter the battlefield you can pay <> to make a spawn for each creature that died this turn [Vile Redeemer]. It’s a tricky card, that might be good in Rally.  
  
**Living or dead, who’s your dream Two-Headed Giant teammate? Why?**  

Adam Tellis, I can’t abandon him now!

**Age:** 24


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Yorba Linda, California


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Grand Prix Las Vegas 2013 Top 8


**What deck did you play and why?**  

Black-Red Dragons. I wanted to play a powerful aggressive deck without worrying about going to time.


**What sideboard card was the most important against the field? Why?**  

I felt like the deck was a 75-card deck, with a lot of variations based on match ups and play/draw.


**What *Oath of the Gatewatch* card are you most excited about? Why?**  

The new angel is pretty sweet! [Linvala, the Preserver]


**Living or dead, who’s your dream Two-Headed Giant teammate? Why?**  

My little brother, Cody Nguyen.

**Age:** 33


**Occupation:** Data Analyst


**Hometown:** San Francisco, California


**Previous Magic accomplishments:** Hall of Fame, etc… a long time ago.


**What deck did you play and why?**  

“Wet Abzan” (Blue Abzan). I was able to tame it to do unexpected things from an already powerful shell. [Stubborn Denial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stubborn+Denial) is a very undervalued card.


**What sideboard card was the most important against the field? Why?**  
[Rising Miasma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rising+Miasma). It’s a great card against Red and good against Tokens.


**What *Oath of the Gatewatch* card are you most excited about? Why?**  

Can’t name one in particular.


**Living or dead, who’s your dream Two-Headed Giant teammate? Why?**  

Ken Ho. He’s even better than my current awesome Two-Headed Giant partner Jeff Ciu. True artists.

**What sideboard card was the most important against the field? Why?**  
[Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut). Killing [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) is very important.
