We've got some video coverage today! In case you haven't noticed, there's a lot of **Magic** being played in tournaments these days. So we turned to Rashad Miller of GGslive.com for more in-depth looks at two recent events: Grand Prix Columbus and July's **Magic Online**  Championship Series.


First up, we've got a new video feature called "The Final Match." Jacob Maynard won [Grand Prix Columbus](/en/events/coverage/rookie-maynard-ravages-modern-columbus) recently, and he sat down with Rashad Miller to go over the final match in detail. Want to see what it takes to win in the finals of a Grand Prix? Here it is, straight from the champion's mouth!

Next, we've got a recap of Season 7 of the **Magic Online** Championship Series. This video spotlights the Top 8 players, the Sealed Deck and Booster Draft decks they played, and match recaps from the Top 8.

We plan on continuing these types of video features for future MOCS season finals and in-person events that have live match coverage, so we're curious what you think of them. Sound off in the forums or in the comments section on each YouTube page and help us deliver the type of video content you need!
