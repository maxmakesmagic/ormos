Legacy Cube Begins March 27
---------------------------


Do you like that one card, from that one set, and you just never see it anymore? Fear not, *Legacy Cube* starts March 27, and you may see it again! *Legacy Cube* is full of some of the best cards from across *Magic*'s history, working together in ways you can only experience in a Cube. And the fun doesn't stop for nearly a full month, ending April 25.


For more information on this update of the *Legacy Cube*, check out [today's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/march-2019-legacy-cube-overhaul-2019-03-19) from the designer, Paul Cheon.

Vintage Super League Playoffs
-----------------------------


It's time for VSL Playoffs—don't miss your chance to get a weekly dose of ridiculously powerful *Magic* every Tuesday evening. The deck-building rules and tournament structure make it even more interesting and unpredictable. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy VSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about one of *Magic*'s deepest formats!


Check it out this Tuesday at 5 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/).


Ready to start playing? [Grab a deck](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/deck-lists-magic-online-products-game-info) and join the Vintage League for matches any time or play for greater rewards with the Vintage Challenge every Saturday at 10 a.m. PT.

MOCS Schedule Updated
---------------------


Looking for more information on future *Magic Online* Championship Series events? Well, good news! The MOCS schedule has been updated to reflect the future, not the past. The past is over. And that is not what calendars are for.


Find the updated calendar [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/schedule-magic-online-products-game-info), and the MOCS schedule, along with more information about the series, [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2019-magic-online-championship-series#MTGOPPCalendar2019).

Notes for June 15 MOCS Open
---------------------------


The MOCS calendar has had an Open on the books since the schedule was first announced last year. And we can now tell you: it's going to be *Modern Horizons* Sealed! This is the only *Modern Horizons* MOCS Open, and that means this will be the only major MH1 event to be run non-phantom. This makes it a great opportunity to collect these cards while earning Leaderboard Points, qualifying for the Mythic Championship, or even winning a coveted seat at the Championships themselves.


Entry options for the MH1 MOCS Open are 500 Play Points or 50 Event Tickets.




---

London Mulligan Testing
-----------------------


From April 10 to May 1, the London Mulligan will be the mulligan used on *Magic Online*. This mulligan is part of an experiment run by *Magic* R&D in their never-ending efforts to improve the game we all know and love. This will apply to all formats, in all events and casual games.


As MTGO is the best and largest way to play classic formats like Legacy and Vintage, this test will provide a critical mass of data to help R&D make a final determination whether to adopt this mulligan for *Magic* as a whole. And importantly, it will allow Mythic Championship competitors to practice their Modern game under the same conditions that they'll face in London.




---

Standard MCQ Finals Friday
--------------------------


On Friday, March 22, there will be a Standard MCQ Finals at 9 a.m. PT. The event will cost 30 Event Tickets or 300 Play Points. The winner will receive invitations to Mythic Championship Barcelona.
