The *Vanguard* supplements consist of oversized cards that modify the game. A *Vanguard* card is selected before the game begins, adjusting a player's starting and maximum hand size and starting life total. Any abilities printed on a *Vanguard* card are played exactly like those of an in-play **Magic** card; however, these abilities have no color, and damage from them isn't damage from a permanent of any type or a source of any color. A *Vanguard* card isn't a **Magic** card, so it can't be affected by spells or abilities.


* Your starting life may be higher or lower than 20, depending on the card.
* Your starting and maximum hand size may be higher or lower than seven, depending on the card.
* Here's the fun part: Each *Vanguard* card gives you some benefit that might be considered "ba-roken" in normal **Magic** play. For example, your creatures are unaffected by summoning sickness, or you draw an extra card each turn.

Popular variants include each player randomly choosing a *Vanguard* card to play, or rotating *Vanguard* cards at determined intervals during a multiplayer game. But, of course, you can use *Vanguard* cards any way you want.


These cards were used in several [Arena](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/arena) seasons (starting in 1997), and were later available as part of a gift box. If you look around, you can find them at card shops and for sale online today.
