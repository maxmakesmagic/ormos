 An FAQ is a collection of clarifications and rulings involving the cards in a new **Magic: The Gathering** set. It's intended to make playing with these new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [www.wizards.com/customerservice](http://www.wizards.com/customerservice). 

This FAQ has two sections, each of which serves a different purpose.

The first section ("General Notes") explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.

The second section ("Card-Specific Notes") contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

### Returning Themes: Guilds and Guildmarks

 The original Ravnica block introduced the plane of Ravnica, a world dominated by cityscape and controlled by ten guilds, each centered around two colors. Five of these ten guilds (Orzhov, Dimir, Gruul, Boros, and Simic) are featured in the *Gatecrash* set. The other five (Azorius, Golgari, Izzet, Rakdos, and Selesnya) were featured in the previous set, *Return to Ravnica*. All ten guilds will return in the May 2013 set: Dragon's Maze. 

 If a card in the *Gatecrash* set is associated with a guild, it features the appropriate guildmark in the background of its text box. These guildmarks have no effect on game play. 


**Orzhov Keyword: Extort**


The white-black guild is the Orzhov Syndicate. The profiteering pontiffs and wealthy nobles of the Orzhov thrive on the devotion—and debt—of their followers. Extort is a new ability that can drain your opponents 1 life at a time.

The official rules for extort are as follows:


> 
> 702.99. Extort
> 
> 
>  702.99a Extort is a triggered ability. "Extort" means "Whenever you cast a spell, you may pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429165526im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white-black.gif). If you do, each opponent loses 1 life and you gain life equal to the total life lost this way." 
> 
> 
> 702.99b If a permanent has multiple instances of extort, each triggers separately.
> 
> 
> 


* You may pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429165526im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white-black.gif) a maximum of one time for each extort triggered ability. You decide whether to pay when the ability resolves.
  
* The amount of life you gain is based on the total amount of life lost, not necessarily the number of opponents you have. For example, if your opponent's life total can't change (perhaps because that player controls [Platinum Emperion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Emperion)), you won't gain any life.
  
* The extort ability doesn't target any player.

**Dimir Keyword: Cipher**


The blue-black guild is the House Dimir. The Dimir are cunning spies, secretive brokers of information throughout Ravnica. Cipher is a new ability found on instants and sorceries that allows you to cast them turn after turn by encoding them on one of your creatures.


> 
> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/gtc/meayfn8y2b_en.jpg)Last Thoughts   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  
>  Sorcery   
>  Draw a card   
>  Cipher *(Then you may exile this spell card encoded on a creature you control. Whenever that creature deals combat damage to a player, its controller may cast a copy of the encoded card without paying its mana cost.)*
> 

The official rules for cipher are as follows:


> 
> 702.97. Cipher
> 
> 
> 702.97a Cipher appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities, one that functions while the spell is on the stack and one that functions while the card with cipher is in the exile zone. "Cipher" means "If this spell is represented by a card, you may exile this card encoded on a creature you control" and "As long as this card is encoded on that creature, that creature has 'Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, you may copy this card and you may cast the copy without paying its mana cost.'"
> 
> 
> 702.97b The term "encoded" describes the relationship between the card with cipher while in the exile zone and the creature chosen when the spell represented by that card resolves.
> 
> 
> 702.97c The card with cipher remains encoded on the chosen creature as long as the card with cipher remains exiled and the creature remains on the battlefield. The card remains encoded on that object even if it changes controller or stops being a creature, as long as it remains on the battlefield.
> 
> 
> 


* The spell with cipher is encoded on the creature as part of that spell's resolution, just after the spell's other effects. That card goes directly from the stack to exile. It never goes to the graveyard.
* You choose the creature as the spell resolves. The cipher ability doesn't target that creature, although the spell with cipher may target that creature (or a different creature) because of its other abilities.
* If the spell with cipher is countered, none of its effects will happen, including cipher. The card will go to its owner's graveyard and won't be encoded on a creature.
* If the creature leaves the battlefield, the exiled card will no longer be encoded on any creature. It will stay exiled.
* If you want to encode the card with cipher onto a noncreature permanent such as a Keyrune that can turn into a creature, that permanent has to be a creature before the spell with cipher starts resolving. You can choose only a creature to encode the card onto.
* The copy of the card with cipher is created in and cast from exile.
* You cast the copy of the card with cipher during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type.
* If you choose not to cast the copy, or you can't cast it (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the copy will cease to exist the next time state-based actions are performed. You won't get a chance to cast the copy at a later time.
* The exiled card with cipher grants a triggered ability to the creature it's encoded on. If that creature loses that ability and subsequently deals combat damage to a player, the triggered ability won't trigger. However, the exiled card will continue to be encoded on that creature.
* If another player gains control of the creature, that player will control the triggered ability. That player will create a copy of the encoded card and may cast it.
* If a creature with an encoded card deals combat damage to more than one player simultaneously (perhaps because some of the combat damage was redirected), the triggered ability will trigger once for each player it deals combat damage to. Each ability will create a copy of the exiled card and allow you to cast it.

**Gruul Ability:Bloodrush**


The red-green guild is the Gruul Clans. Loosely organized and fiercely aggressive, the savage clans of the Gruul crave battle. Bloodrush is an ability word that appears in italics at the beginning of abilities of creature cards you can discard to give an attacking creature a bonus. (An ability word has no rules meaning.)


> 
> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/gtc/tm143aipok_en.jpg)Slaughterhorn   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)  
>  Creature — Beast

**Boros Ability Word: Battalion**


The red-white guild is the Boros Legion. The Boros are the most formidable military force on Ravnica. Battalion is an ability word that appears in italics at the beginning of abilities that trigger whenever you attack with that creature and at least two other creatures. (An ability word has no rules meaning.)


> 
> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/gtc/0tnqrwbo5o_en.jpg)Warmind Infantry   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  
>  Creature — Elemental Soldier   
>  2/3   
> *Battalion* — Whenever Warmind Infantry and at least two other creatures attack, Warmind Infantry gets +2/+0 until end of turn. 


* The three attacking creatures don't have to be attacking the same player or planeswalker.
  
* Once a battalion ability has triggered, it doesn't matter how many creatures are still attacking when that ability resolves.
  
* The effects of battalion abilities vary from card to card. Read each card carefully.
  

**Simic Keyword: Evolve**


The green-blue guild is the Simic Combine. The Simic are Ravnica's stewards of nature and the wild. Evolve is a new ability that allows a creature to grow when a larger creature enters the battlefield under your control.


> 
> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/gtc/ptvrnuyfro_en.jpg)Cloudfin Raptor   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  
>  Creature — Bird Mutant   
>  0/1   
>  Flying   
>  Evolve *(Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, if that creature has greater power or toughness than this creature, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.)*
> 

The official rules for evolve are as follows:


> 
> 702.98. Evolve
> 
> 
> 702.98a Evolve is a triggered ability. "Evolve" means "Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, if that creature's power is greater than this creature's power and/or that creature's toughness is greater than this creature's toughness, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature."
> 
> 
> 702.98b If a creature has multiple instances of evolve, each triggers separately.
> 
> 
> 


* When comparing the stats of the two creatures, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.
  
* Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all. For example, if you control a 2/3 creature with evolve and a 2/2 creature enters the battlefield under your control, you won't have the opportunity to cast a spell like [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) to make the 2/2 creature large enough to cause evolve to trigger.
  
* If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.
  
* If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
  
* If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.
  
* When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.

**Returning Mechanic: Hybrid Cards**


 Hybrid mana symbols represent a cost that can be paid with either of two colors. For example, ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429165527im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue-black.gif) can be paid with either ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) or ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif). It's both a blue and a black mana symbol. A card with the mana cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429165527im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue-black.gif) is both blue and black, and its converted mana cost is 1. Visually, the ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429165527im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue-black.gif) symbol is a circle divided in half: the upper left looks like a blue mana symbol and the lower right looks like a black mana symbol. 


> 
> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/gtc/j1m7z578aa_en.jpg)Deathcult Rogue   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429165527im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue-black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429165527im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue-black.gif)  
>  Creature — Human Rogue   
>  2/2   
>  Deathcult Rogue can't be blocked except by Rogues.   
> 


* Hybrid mana symbols appear only in costs, such as the mana cost in the upper right corner of a card or the cost to activate an activated ability.
  
* A card with hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost is each color that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. For example, the Deathcult Rogue above is blue and black, even if you cast it with only blue mana.
  
* As you cast a spell or activate an activated ability with hybrid mana symbols in its cost, you choose which color of mana you will spend for each hybrid mana symbol. You do this at the same time you would choose modes or choose a value for an X in a mana cost. For example, you choose whether you'll cast Deathcult Rogue by paying ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif), ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif), or ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif).

**Cycle: Ravnica "Dual Lands"**


 There are five nonbasic lands in the *Gatecrash* set that each have two basic land types. These lands were originally printed in the Ravnica block. 


> 
> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/gtc/dvdz6c6zos_en.jpg)Stomping Ground   
>  Land — Mountain Forest   
>  {T}: Add ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) or ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) to your mana pool.   
>  As [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground) enters the battlefield, you may pay 2 life. If you don't, [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground) enters the battlefield tapped. 


* Although these cards have basic land types, they are not basic lands. For example, you couldn't find one of these cards if an effect told you to search your library for a "basic land card."
  
* Effects that care about a basic land type are looking for lands that have that land type, not just lands with that name. For example, forestwalk cares if the defending player controls a land with the land type Forest (such as [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground)), not just lands named Forest.
  
* If another effect instructs you to put one of these lands onto the battlefield tapped, it will enter the battlefield tapped whether you pay 2 life or not.
  
* If more than one of these lands are entering the battlefield at the same time, you'll decide whether to pay 2 life for each one individually, then put them all onto the battlefield. For example, if you have 3 life and two [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground)s are entering the battlefield at the same time, you could pay 2 life for only one of them, not both.

**Cycle: Guildgates**


 The *Gatecrash* set includes a cycle of nonbasic lands with the subtype Gate, introduced in the *Return to Ravnica* set. Each guild has a Gate card with Guildgate in its name that taps for mana of either of that guild's colors. 


>

* The subtype Gate has no special rules significance, but other spells and abilities may refer to it.
  
* Gate is not a basic land type.
  

**Cycle: Keyrunes**


Each guild has a Keyrune, an artifact that taps for mana of either of that guild's colors and can become a creature.

* Until the ability that turns the Keyrune into a creature resolves, the Keyrune is colorless.
  
* Activating the ability that turns the Keyrune into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to another number, but effects that modify power and/or toughness without directly setting them will still apply. For example, say you activate the last ability of Gruul Keyrune. After it resolves, you cast [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) targeting it. It's now 6/5. Then [Diminish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminish) ("Target creature becomes 1/1 until end of turn") is cast targeting it. Once [Diminish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminish) resolves, Gruul Keyrune would be 4/4. Activating Gruul Keyrune's last ability a second time would make it 6/5 again until end of turn.

* An "attacking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield attacking this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game, or the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat. There's no such thing as an attacking creature outside of the combat phase.

* Only Agoraphobia's controller can activate its last ability, no matter who controls the creature Agoraphobia's attached to.
  
* Agoraphobia's last ability can be activated only while it's on the battlefield.
  
* Players don't have priority to cast spells and activate abilities between combat damage being assigned and being dealt. This means that if you want to return Agoraphobia to its owner's hand before combat damage is dealt, you must do so before combat damage is assigned (and the creature will no longer get -5/-0).

* An "attacking creature" or "blocking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker or blocker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield attacking or blocking this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking or blocking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game, the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat, or the creature or creatures it was blocking have left combat, as appropriate.
* Arrows of Justice may be cast during the end of combat step, after combat damage has been dealt.

If damage dealt by Aurelia's Fury is redirected from a player to a planeswalker he or she controls, that player will be able to cast noncreature spells that turn. If you want to stop a player from casting noncreature spells this turn, you can't choose to redirect the damage to a planeswalker he or she controls.

* If all of the targets are illegal when Aurelia's Fury tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. No creature or player will be dealt damage.

* If Bane Alley Broker's first ability resolves when you have no cards in your hand, you'll draw a card and then exile it. You won't have the opportunity to cast that card (or do anything else with it) before exiling it.
  
* Due to a recent rules change, once you are allowed to look at a face-down card in exile, you are allowed to look at that card as long as it's exiled. If you no longer control Bane Alley Broker when its last ability resolves, you can continue to look at the relevant cards in exile to choose one to return.
  
* Bane Alley Broker's second and third abilities apply to cards exiled with that specific Bane Alley Broker, not any other creature named Bane Alley Broker. You should keep cards exiled by different Bane Alley Brokers separate.
  
* If Bane Alley Broker leaves the battlefield, the cards exiled with it will be exiled indefinitely. If it later returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the cards exiled with it in its previous existence. You won't be able to use the "new" Bane Alley Broker to return cards exiled with the "old" one.
  
* Even if not all players can look at the exiled cards, each card's owner is still known. It is advisable to keep cards owned by different players in distinct piles in case another player gains control of Bane Alley Broker and exiles one or more cards with it.

* Choosing 0 as the value for X will likely cause creatures you control to become 0/0 and be put into the graveyard.
  
* Biomass Mutation overwrites any effects that set the power and/or toughness of a creature you control to a specific value. Effects that modify power and/or toughness but don't set them to a specific value (like the one created by [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth)), power/toughness changes from counters, and effects that switch a creature's power and toughness will continue to apply. For example, say you control a 1/1 creature that's getting +4/+2 from an Aura, has a +1/+1 counter on it, and is affected by an effect that switches its power and toughness. This creature is 4/6. If you cast Biomass Mutation with X equal to 4, the creature would become 7/9 (4/4, +4/+2 from the Aura, +1/+1 from the counter, then switch power and toughness).

* You can choose a number of targets up to the number of opponents you have, one target per opponent.
  
* You cast the cards one at a time, choosing modes, targets and so on. The last card you cast will be the first one to resolve.
  
* When casting an instant or sorcery card this way, ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," must be followed.
  
* If you can't cast one of the target instant or sorcery cards, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, or if you choose not to cast one, it will remain in its owner's graveyard.
  
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
  
* If a card has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.
  
* If an instant or sorcery card you cast this way is countered, it will still be exiled.
  
* If you cast an instant or sorcery spell with cipher this way, you may exile the card encoded on a creature you control. If you can't, or if you choose not to, the card will end up exiled but not encoded on a creature.
  
* If an instant or sorcery card you cast this way goes to a zone other than exile or a graveyard, perhaps because one of its abilities says to put it into its owner's hand, it won't be exiled. This is true even if the card would be put into a graveyard later that turn.

* If a player has no cards in his or her hand and Dinrova's Horror returns a card to that player's hand, the player must discard that card. He or she won't have the opportunity to cast that card (or do anything else with it) before discarding it.
  
* A token permanent returned to a player's hand isn't a card and can't be discarded. It will cease to exist when state-based actions are performed after the ability finishes resolving.

It won't copy counters on the Giant Adephage, nor will it copy other effects that have changed Giant Adephage's power, toughness, types, color, or so on.

He's still a planeswalker. Prevent all damage that would be dealt to him this turn. [-15]: Exile all other permanents. 


* You put a loyalty counter on Gideon, Champion of Justice as part of the cost of activating the first ability. When that ability resolves, you count the number of creatures controlled by the target opponent and put that many additional loyalty counters on Gideon.
  
* If the first ability is countered (perhaps because the target opponent is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve), you won't put any additional loyalty counters on Gideon, although the loyalty counter you put on him to activate the ability will remain.
  
* If Gideon, Champion of Justice becomes a creature due to his second ability, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
  
* Gideon, Champion of Justice's power and toughness are set to the number of loyalty counters on him when his second ability resolves. They won't change later in the turn if the number of loyalty counters on him changes.
  
* If Gideon, Champion of Justice becomes a creature the same turn he enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any of his {T} abilities (if he gains any).
  
* If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon, Champion of Justice after his second ability has resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he's indestructible, if Gideon, Champion of Justice has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
  
* Gideon, Champion of Justice's second ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human and Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: Gideon is just a planeswalker type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
  
* If you activate Gideon, Champion of Justice's second ability and then a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of him, that copy will be just a planeswalker, not a creature. (The effect of Gideon's second ability isn't copied, just as the effect of a [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth), for example, wouldn't be copied.) Since both permanents will be planeswalkers with the planeswalker type Gideon, each one will be put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action due to the "planeswalker uniqueness rule."
  
* If you activate Gideon, Champion of Justice's second ability and then a permanent that's already on the battlefield becomes a copy of him, that copy will be just a planeswalker, not a creature. If the first Gideon, Champion of Justice is still on the battlefield by the time the copy effect happens, each of those permanents will be put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action due to the "planeswalker uniqueness rule." If the first Gideon, Champion of Justice is gone by this time, the other permanent will be put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action for having no loyalty counters on him (unless, for some odd reason, he already had loyalty counters on him).
  
* Say you activate Gideon, Champion of Justice's second ability, and then an opponent gains control of him before combat. You may have any of your creatures attack Gideon, Champion of Justice (since he's still a planeswalker). Then Gideon, Champion of Justice may block (since he's a creature). He may block any eligible attacking creature, including one that's attacking him! During combat, he behaves as an attacked planeswalker and/or a blocking creature, as appropriate. For example, he deals combat damage to any creatures he's blocking, but he doesn't deal combat damage to any unblocked creatures that are attacking him.

* Lazav, Dimir Mastermind becomes a copy of the creature card in the graveyard. If that card is no longer in the graveyard when Lazav's ability resolves, use the characteristics of that card as it last existed in the graveyard. Notably, copy effects that applied to the creature card when it was on the battlefield won't be copied by Lazav. For example, if a [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone) is put into an opponent's graveyard from the battlefield and you use Lazav's ability, it will become 0/0. It won't become a copy of whatever [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone) was copying.
  
* Lazav doesn't copy the creature card's name and remains legendary, so if another Lazav is on the battlefield, both will be put into their owners' graveyards as a state-based action, even if the first one is copying another creature card.
  
* If multiple creature cards are put into an opponent's graveyard at the same time, you choose the order that Lazav's triggered abilities go on the stack.
  
* Enters-the-battlefield abilities of the creature card Lazav is copying won't trigger as Lazav is already on the battlefield when it becomes a copy of that creature card.
  
* Token creatures dying won't cause Lazav's triggered ability to trigger.

* If the creature can't block (perhaps because it has become tapped or it doesn't have flying and all attacking creatures do), then the requirement to block does nothing.

* You can choose a number of targets up to the number of opponents you have, one target per opponent.
  
* If Sylvan Primordial's enters-the-battlefield ability resolves but one of the target noncreature permanents isn't destroyed (perhaps because it is indestructible or it regenerated), it won't count toward the number of Forest cards you can put onto the battlefield.
  
* You search and shuffle your library only once.

* The copy effect created by the last activated ability doesn't have a duration. It will last until Thespian's Stage leaves the battlefield or another copy effect overwrites it. The permanent will no longer have the first ability of Thespian's Stage.
  
* A land's copiable values are those printed on it, as modified by other copy effects. Counters and other effects aren't copied. Notably, if you copy a land that is also a creature because of a temporary effect (such as [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade)), Thespian's Stage will become just the "unanimated" land.
  
* No enters-the-battlefield abilities of the land Thespian's Stage is copying will trigger. Thespian's Stage was already on the battlefield.

* If you reveal a nonland card, you may cast it during the resolution of Unexpected Results. Ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," must be followed.
  
* If you can't cast the card (perhaps because there are no legal targets), or if you choose not to, the card will remain on top of the library.
  
* If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
  
* If the card has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.

* Urban Evolution's effect allows you to play an additional land during your main phase. Doing so follows the normal timing rules for playing lands. In particular, you don't get to play a land as Urban Evolution resolves; Urban Evolution fully resolves (and you'll draw three cards, perhaps including a land you'll play later) first.
  
* The effects of multiple Urban Evolutions in the same turn are cumulative. They're also cumulative with other effects that let you play additional lands, such as the one from [Rites of Flourishing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Flourishing).
  
* If you somehow manage to cast Urban Evolution when it's not your turn, you'll draw three cards when it resolves, but you won't be able to play a land that turn.

* Multiple instances of lifelink are redundant. Giving the same creature lifelink more than once won't cause you to gain additional life.
  
* Each time the second ability resolves, a delayed triggered ability is created. Whenever you gain life that turn, each of those abilities will trigger. For example, if you activate the second ability twice (and let those abilities resolve) and then you gain 2 life, each opponent will lose a total of 4 life. Each instance will cause two abilities to trigger, each causing that player to lose 2 life.
