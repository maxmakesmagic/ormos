You've been playing in *Magic Origins* [Release Events](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-magic-origins-prerelease-and-release-events-2015-06-29#4322draft) for over a week now, showing off your spell mastery prowess, slinging spells with a furor that has earned you no small amount of renown.


Menacing at prospective foes from your computer screen, you ask yourself, "What's next?" Grab the nearest prescient [echinoderm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=398592) and scry into the future with me.

Hmm. Yes, the vision is becoming clearer. There appears to be a championship on the horizon.


Ah ha!


The *Magic Origins* Championships are coming soon to *Magic Online*, beginning with Limited Qualifiers!


All great Sealed decks begin their origin stories as six simple booster packsâ€”bad Sealed decks do too. Find out which path your Sealed pool will travel in the [*Magic Origins* Limited Championship Qualifiers](#ltdqualifier), beginning on Wednesday, August 12, at 12:30 p.m. and running until Tuesday, August 18, at 9:30 p.m.Pacific (UTC-7). After that, we transition to the Standard Championship Qualifiers!


In the *Magic Origins* Standard Championship Qualifiers, you can live the dream and compete with a deck that has all five *Magic Origins* planeswalkers in it. Over the course of your matches, watch as your gang of magical children transforms into a posse of dimension-jumping super-mages! Or, build a *realistic* deck and have a chance at the Standard Championship Finals. Your call. Look deep within, make your choice, and show up to the [*Magic Origins* Standard Championship Qualifiers](#strdqualifier) between Wednesday, August 19, 12:30 p.m., through Tuesday, August 25, 9:30 p.m. Pacific (UTC-7). All qualifiers run every three hours, on the half hour, so make sure to plan out which event you want to join ahead of time. Four or five wins in any Qualifier earns you a non-premium promo [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) and an invitation to the corresponding Championship Finals!


Before moving onto the details of the Championship Finals, let's pause for a moment and talk about a small change to [promos](#ptomos) this time around. For *Magic Origins* Championship events, all promo awards will revolve around the Qualifiers. That way, if you are only in it for the promos, the Qualifier will be the only event you need to play in. Participation in any Qualifier will nab you a non-premium alternate-art version of [Conclave Naturalists](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conclave+Naturalists) for your collection and, as mentioned above, four or five wins in a Qualifier Event will get you a non-premium promo version of [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish).

This way, only those with a thirst for glory and the title of *Magic Origins* Champion (not to mention sweet prizes) will be competing in the Championship Finals.


[*Magic Origins* Limited Championship Finals](#ltdfinals) are up first on Sunday, August 23, 7:00 a.m. Pacific. The [*Magic Origins* Standard Championship Finals](#strdfinals) follow closely behind on Saturday, August 29, 9:00 a.m. In addition to big prizes, the first place winners will be heralded across [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online) in an article that regales readers with a play-by-play of their victories, as well as the Championship-winning decklists. If you missed it, check out the *Dragons of Tarkir* Champion announcement [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online-dragons-tarkir-championship-winners-2015-07-06).


Good luck on your journey to the Championship Finals!
