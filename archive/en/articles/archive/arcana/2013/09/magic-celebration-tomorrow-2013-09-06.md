Celebrate **Magic**  this weekend with your favorite local game store! Enjoy a global **Magic**  event on September 7, 2013. 

This is an awesome event to bring friends who are new to **Magic**  along with you. It's a casual environment perfect for introducing new players and showing them how to play.

Each **Magic** Celebration player receives one ***Magic** 2014* Core Set booster pack\* and achievement card\*. After opening your booster pack, you'll choose a ***Magic** 2014* Core Set Sample Deck\* to add cards from your booster pack to.

\* - While supplies last.

At the risk of repeating myself from last week's Arcana, here's how the event will run:

To play, you open your booster pack and choose a color of cards from your booster you want to play. Then, ask the tournament organizer for a ***Magic** 2014* Core Set Sample Deck of that color to use as the rest of your deck. Shuffle the cards you want to play from your booster pack into your sample deck and play three best-of-three matches with different opponents.

When you've played all of your matches, show your completed score card (on the back of your achievement card) to the tournament organizer to receive an additional ***Magic** 2014* Core Set booster pack as a prize!
