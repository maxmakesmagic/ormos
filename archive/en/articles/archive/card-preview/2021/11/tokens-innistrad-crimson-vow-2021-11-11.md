Shield your candle flame and huddle close to gaze upon the tokens of [*Innistrad: Crimson Vow*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/innistrad-crimson-vow)! The set and [its associated Commander decks](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/innistrad-crimson-vow-commander-decklists-2021-11-08) contain a combined 25 full-art tokens, one emblem, and one double-sided Day // Night token. In Draft and Set Boosters, you can find one emblem, nineteen full-art tokens, and the double-sided Day // Night token (exclusive to Draft and Set Boosters). In Collector Boosters, you can find many of these as traditional foil double-sided tokens.


Each Commander deck includes ten double-sided tokens with a combined total of seven double-sided variations. Six full-art tokens are unique to *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* Commander products.


If you haven't yet seen the cards that make these tokens, go check out the [Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/innistrad-crimson-vow) and [Variant Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/innistrad-crimson-vow-variants)â€”plus the [*Innistrad: Crimson Vow* Commander Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/innistrad-crimson-vow-commander).
