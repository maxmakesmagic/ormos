On March 14, *Magic* Story is entering a new era.


We'll be testing out a new approach to *Magic* Story. It'll still be free, published online, and intertwined with the cards, but will feature well-known authors' takes on our story. For *Dominaria*, that means I'm introducing a new writer to you—or maybe a familiar one, if you've read her work: Martha Wells!


Check out my talk with Martha as we discuss writing for *Magic*, how awesome fans can be, the differences between writing red characters and blue ones, and even a few tidbits about the *Dominaria* story.


Welcome, Martha!
