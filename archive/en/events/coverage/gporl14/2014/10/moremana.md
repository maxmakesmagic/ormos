 How important is mana in *Khans of Tarkir* Draft?



It's a simply question but just as deep and penetrating as when we asked about it yesterday for Sealed. There we learned that mana really matters, and the "really" is for real. Whether its to power out the best spells in your pool or to add even more powerful cards for "free" effectively, it was the nonbasic lands that truly shined.


With one draft already complete at Grand Prix Orlando, we caught up with a few folks that executed a 3-0 sweep of their draft pod to see what their thoughts on were.



 "Tell Rich I had the pick order set on Monday," Frank Karsten said as we chatted up, referring to coverage reporter and all-around *Magic* legend Rich Hagon's Day 2 introduction where he predicted Karsten would have a pick order by lunch time. Karsten, a seven-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor with a win in Copenhagen long ago and a couple World Championship and Pro Tour Top 8s thrown in to boot, is a member of the Pro Tour Hall of Fame and all-around man of the numbers. Known for dissecting what matters and why in decks, he always has insight into which cards matter most – relatively speaking – for draft formats.






*Frank Karsten is a Hall of Fame member with a skill for making *Magic*'s numbers tell their tales.*
