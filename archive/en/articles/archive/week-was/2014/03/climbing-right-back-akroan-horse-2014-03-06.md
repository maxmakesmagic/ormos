The Pro Tour is a wild horse that does not want its riders to sit comfortably on its back. It can be a heartbreaking moment when players have spent their entire **Magic** playing careers just trying to earn that chance to ride the horse. For most players, it will end in a dusty fall onto the hard-packed dirt as it bucks and thrashes and bares its teeth, trying with every fiber of its being to buck them from the saddle. We talk to players all the time who have dug in their spurs and broken the beast (or the format) and are able to string together appearance after appearance with solid finishes and all the rewards that come with it. But even for that elite class of players, it's rare for them to have lasted very long out of the gate in their first attempt to ride at that level. 

 I get to look back at the careers of the very best players year after year, by virtue of my involvement with the **Magic: The Gathering** Pro Tour Hall of Fame, with their Pro Tour appearances and finishes laid out in column after column of an Excel spreadsheet. Time and time again there will be multiple-PT gaps between appearances at the onset of their careers as players have to dust themselves off and get right back on that horse via another PTQ or Grand Prix finish. 

 One player who found himself a little dusty after [Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptbng14/welcome) was soon-to-be twenty-four-year-old Brennan DeCandio. DeCandio was playing in just his second Pro Tour—his first came in 2011 when he qualified for [Pro Tour Philadelphia](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptphi11/welcome)—and while he made Day Two this time out, he was back where he started with just 3 Pro Points to show for weeks of practice and years of playing the game—years that when they are added up sum up to half his lifespan.
