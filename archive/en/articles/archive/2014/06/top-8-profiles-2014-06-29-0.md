**Which cards were the most important in your Sealed and Draft decks this weekend, and why?**  
[Golden Hind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golden+Hind). It works all the time.

### Christian Calcano


**Hometown:** New York, NY  
**Occupation:** #TeamPanda


 

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:**   

Two Pro Tour Top 16s, 3 Grand Prix Top 8s including this one


**What were your Sealed and Draft records?**  

Sealed: 9-0, Draft 1: 2-1, Draft 2: 2-1


**What did you play in Sealed, and how did it go?**  

Blue-Green with eighteen lands, a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), and [Hydra Broodmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydra+Broodmaster)


**What did you play in your drafts, and how did they go?**  

Blue-Red in both drafts. Was fortunate to get a 2-1 in both.


**Which cards were the most important in your Sealed and Draft decks this weekend, and why?**  

Sealed - [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) for sure. The card advantage and life gain is too good in Sealed. Draft - [Fearsome Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fearsome+Temper) in the first deck led to explosive draws. [Bladetusk Boar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladetusk+Boar) in the second deck because he's overpowered.

Draft 1: R/G with [Revel of the Fallen God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revel+of+the+Fallen+God) that I can cast on turn 5 via [Satyr Hedonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Hedonist).

**Which cards were the most important in your Sealed and Draft decks this weekend, and why?**  

Obviously [Satyr Hedonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Hedonist)! It can power out a huge creature on turn 3. [Fear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fear) the Satyr!
