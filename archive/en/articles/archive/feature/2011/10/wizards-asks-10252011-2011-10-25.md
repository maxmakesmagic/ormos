*What's your favorite tribe in Innistrad, and why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** Werewolves, of course!

I mean, don't get me wrong. The Zombies of *Innistrad* are terrifyingly relentless, and the Vampires play in a way that appeals to me. Spirits in *Innistrad* have a ghostly, fly-right-through-your-blockers flavor that I appreciate, and I'll admit I've got kind of a soft spot for Humans, generally speaking. (I happen to be married to one.)

Werewolves just have so much going for them, though. Thematically, they speak to the inherent conflict between civilization and nature, and to the potential savagery that lies beneath even the most polished veneer of civility. Flavorfully, each one tells a story, from the [lowly shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatstaf+Shepherd) who wakes to find [his flock slaughtered](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatstaf+Howler) to the [gang of toughs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Instigator+Gang) who embrace [their feral nature](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildblood+Pack).

Mechanically, they're mostly pretty powerful, and they make your opponents play around them in a very careful, monster-stalked kind of way. And I'll admit I take no small joy in the physical action of transforming themâ€”usually while howling.
