It sounds like something out of the tabloids… *"Screaming Skull Appears in Wave of Lava!"*


But it's really just one of the hidden "Easter Eggs" that artists slip into their work. We already spent one Magic Arcana looking at the [surfer](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/115) in Donato's Giancola's [Flame Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Wave) painting, but at a show recently, he pointed out the real hidden gem in that piece: the screaming skull. "No one ever picks up on that one," he commented.


So here it is. It's highlighted in the red rectangle, and then shown isolated with the contrast turned up. If you noticed it before, kudos to you! We sure didn't.
