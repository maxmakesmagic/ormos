You're probably not even reading these words. It's okay. I understand. Who has time to read when there are awesome promo cards to look at! So why waste typing? Let's jump right in and look at some of the goodies *Hour of Devastation* has in store.


Planeswalker Decks
==================


Let's start with the Planeswalker Decks. We'll be revealing the unique cards found only in the Planeswalker Decks later in preview season, but we can show you the packaging for the two decks, including the face cards—one of which you've probably already seen in the *Hour of Devastation* trailer. But if not, here's the trailer again!

And here are the two packages:

And here are those two cards on their own!

Promos
======


Now on to the juicy stuff. Before you check these cards out, I would recommend reading the [Mechanics of *Hour of Devastation*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/hour-devastation-mechanics-2017-06-16) so you know what some of these words mean!


First up, if you participate in Draft Weekend July 15–16, you can pick up this Ramunap Excavator, who does a pretty good [Crucible of Worlds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+Worlds) impression.

If you pick up a box of *Hour of Devastation* (while supplies last at participating stores—check with your local store for availability), you could get this devastatingly tricky Wildfire Eternal. To block or not to block? That is the question this Zombie Jackal Cleric begs you to answer.

Next up is Game Day, taking place August 5. Just for participating, you can pick up this full-art Abrade, maybe the most flexible [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) I've ever seen.

If you make it to the Top 8 of your Game Day, you could receive this, um, adorable? Sure, adorable Cat ready to pounce.

And if you somehow win the whole darn thing? Boom—here's a playmat only for your troubles.

That's all for today! Be sure to check with your [local game store](http://locator.wizards.com/) to check on availability for these promos and times the events are scheduled!
