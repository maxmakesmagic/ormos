Mariah Boehm's brownies were the talk of the rehab wing last week. She made them during her allotted occupational therapy time, and that night she meticulously circled the ward, offering one to each of the other kids in the rehab wing of the hospital. Even the nurses grabbed a few.



 Through her own pain and difficult recovery, Mariah is making sure she gives something back to those around her. And the *Magic* community she's always been a part of is doing the same.




 It's called Team Panda, something you've likely seen mentioned over the last few weeks. It formed after Mariah, the 17-year-old daughter of longtime and well-respected east-coast *Magic* regular Tony Pagliocco, was struck by a car in a hit-and-run accident while walking home from school last month. She suffered breaks in her legs and vertebrae and sustained traumatic damage to her spinal cord. She's unable to walk and her family is facing a long and uphill road as they adjust to medical bills and the costs of finding wheelchair-accessible housing.




 As the news broke across the *Magic* community, it didn't take long for Team Panda — named after Tony's nickname for his daughter, "my little panda," — to form. *Magic* players from across the country wanted to find a way to help in any way they could, and that's exactly what they've done. The community has rallied behind a fund to help cover the family's medical costs, but they haven't stopped there.



Several prominent members of the community have campaigned to raise awareness for the cause, from small things like creating the #TeamPanda tag for use in social media to wearing panda-themed gear at tournaments to donating winnings to the cause. 





*Well-known pros Craig Wescoe and Christian Calcano were spotted wearing #TeamPanda gear at Grand Prix Chicago last week to help raise awareness for the cause.*
