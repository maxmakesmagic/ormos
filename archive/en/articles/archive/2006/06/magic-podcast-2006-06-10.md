It's 2006…if you're not subscribed to at least one podcast, get your lazy butt out of the 20th Century and into the future!

**WHAT IS PODCASTING?**


Podcasting is delivering audio and video content on demand so that it can be enjoyed at the user's convenience. The main benefit of podcasting is that listeners can sync content to their media player and take it with them to listen whenever they want to. But they're not just for iPods…the files are ready to watch or listen to on just about any computer.


1. Go to <http://www.apple.com/podcasting/>
2. Download iTunes version 6
3. Launch iTunes.
4. From the dropdown menus, select Advanced -- Subscribe to Podcast
5. When prompted for a URL, enter **<http://www.wizards.com/magic/rsspodcast.xml>** and click OK.

Once you subscribe to the podcast, iTunes will automatically check for new files and download them to your computer. To ensure that you get timely updates, set your Podcast Settings to check for new episodes every hour (the Settings button is in the lower-right corner of the iTunes window, or you can find it under Edit -- Preferences -- Podcast).
