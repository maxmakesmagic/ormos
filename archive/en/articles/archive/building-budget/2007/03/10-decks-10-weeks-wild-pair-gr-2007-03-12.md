Welcome back to 10 Decks in 10 Weeks! For those who are just joining us, we're in week 2 of a 10-week experiment. Each week, I build a Standard-legal two-color deck based around a certain card or concept. At the start of the next article, I keep all of the cards from one of the colors and build a new deck incorporating the cards from the previous week and adding cards of another color. [Last week's deck](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/10-decks-10-weeks-two-ladies-gw-2007-03-05) was a white-green Enchantress deck featuring [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), and this week's deck is a green-red [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) deck! Before we get started, let me throw out a little bit of news.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/bb_10decks_logo.jpg)First off, here's the nifty new logo for the 10 Decks in 10 Weeks project! You'll also notice that I've redone the sidebar for the column. There's a full chart of the progress of the 10 decks. As you'll notice, all ten color combinations are now mapped out. Last week, I asked for input about which decks you'd like to see after week three's [Aeon Chronicler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler) blue-red deck. Did I get any good suggestions? Did I ever! Based on the most popular suggestions for each color combination, I've locked in weeks four through six.


Week 4: Blue-black [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim)/Discard. My first [Building on a Budget column](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/bb53) was a U/B [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim) deck. This was the most suggested blue-black deck that people wanted to see me do, and to be honest there have been a *lot* of advances in blue and black discard in the past year - [Magus of the Jar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Jar), [Wistful Thinking](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wistful+Thinking), [Piracy Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy+Charm) and [Funeral Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Funeral+Charm), [Stupor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stupor), [Blizzard Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blizzard+Specter), [Delirium Skeins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delirium+Skeins), [Dismal Failure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismal+Failure), [Mindstab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindstab), [Riptide Pilferer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Pilferer), [Venarian Glimmer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venarian+Glimmer), and [Wit's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wit%27s+End), to name a few. I envision this being an entirely different deck then the one from last year.


![Whitemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Whitemane+Lion)
Week 5: White-black "Rescue" deck. The most popular suggestion was a white-black deck based around creatures with comes-into-play effects ([Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal), [Ravenous Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Rats), [Shrieking Grotesque](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrieking+Grotesque)) and the new rescue creatures from *Planar Chaos* ([Whitemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitemane+Lion), [Stonecloaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonecloaker), and friends). This leads into:


Week 6: White-blue [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) deck. This will be really interesting, because a lot of the cards that are strong in the white-black rescue deck are equally strong in a white--blue Blink deck - both seek to abuse comes-into-play effect creatures. 


The remaining four weeks will be white-red, red-black, black-green, and green-blue. As we get closer to those columns, I'll be coming to you guys again for suggestions about the themes and cards *you'd* like to see on a budget!


The most consistent build of The Two Ladies last week was the third build - a straight green-white iteration of the deck. For this week, we're taking out the white and adding in red to build a deck around [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair). Here's what's left from the deck after we take out the white cards and the lands that produce white mana.

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Forest)

















  
Out: 4 [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), 4 [Faith's Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters), 4 [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress), 9 [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), 3 [Retether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retether), 4 [Selesnya Sanctuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Sanctuary), 3 [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop), 4 [Temporal Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation)


The first addition to the deck is four [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair). Since we're building a deck around the card, it's a slam-dunk, no-brainer to include in the deck.


In: 4 [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair)


Now, we can't just build a deck around a card without examining what it does. [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) is actually a fairly complex card to build around. On the surface it looks straightforward:



> 
> "Whenever a creature comes into play, if you played it from your hand, you may search your library for a creature card with the same total power and toughness and put it into play. If you do, shuffle your library."
> 
> 
> 


In its simplest form, [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) allows you a play a 1/1 creature, and then grab another 1/1 creature. For instance, if you play [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), you could grab [Royal Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin), [Boreal Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid), or even another [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves)! Because [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) cares about total power and toughness, you can also grab a 0/2 creature ([Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter)) or a 2/0 creature by playing a 1/1 creature.


A 2/0 creature? Well, here's where the next layer of complexity comes in with [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair)! When you play a creature with [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), it calculates that creature's power and toughness when the effect resolves. This means that if you make your creature larger in response to the trigger, or your creature comes into play with +1/+1 counters, [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) will look for its final power and toughness, not its initial power/toughness. Let me explain this with an example:


![Wild Pair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wild+Pair)
I have a [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) in play, and I play [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder). [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) is a 0/0 creature that comes into play with two +1/+1 counters and has the ability to remove a +1/+1 counter to gain 2 life. When [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) comes into play, [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair)'s triggered ability goes on the stack. I then have the opportunity to play spells or effects. 


Scenario One: I do nothing, and let [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair)'s ability resolve. [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) is a 2/2 creature, so I can get any creature from my deck with a combined power/toughness of four - a 0/4, a 1/3, a 2/2, a 3/1 or a 4/0. These must be the numbers printed on the card itself, meaning I cannot get another [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) out of my deck - it is a 0/0 as printed!


Scenario Two: I remove one counter from [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) to gain 2 life, and then let [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair)'s ability resolve. This makes [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) a 1/1, allowing me to grab any 0/2, 1/1, or 2/0 creature from my deck. These include [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus) and [Phantom Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm) - again, [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) only cares about the numbers printed on the card it's fetching while the card is in your deck. Once [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) puts [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus) and [Phantom Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm) into play, they will have their full complement of +1/+1 tokens - so [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus) will be a 4/4, and [Phantom Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm) a 6/4!


Scenario Three: I remove both counters from [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) to gain 4 life. [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) goes to the graveyard since it has zero toughness, and [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) remembers the last-known information of [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) when searching for a creature - meaning I can get a 0/0 creature! This includes another [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder), or any creatures with a power/toughness of \*/\* - The \*s equal zero when in your deck.


Scenario Four: I remove one counter from [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder), gain 2 life, and then activate [Pendelhaven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven) to make [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) a 2/3. [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair)'s ability resolves, allowing me to get a 0/5, 1/4, 2/3, 3/2, 4/1 or 5/0 creature.   
 While trying to build a viable budget [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) deck, I found there were several deckbuilding pitfalls that one could fall into. Let me walk you through the three versions of the deck that didn't work well, and one version that flowed smooth as silk.


### Version #1: Variable Power/Toughness


![Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kird+Ape)
For the first build of the deck, I wanted to take maximum advantage of the ability to have variable power/toughnesses when resolving [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair). The base for the deck were 1/1 creatures (and/or 0/2 creatures). I added in [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) for mana acceleration, and [Scryb Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger) as an instant-speed way to bring creatures into play with [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair). I also wanted to run [Kird Ape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape), since it is an efficient creature in a red-green deck, can be tutored for with Elves and Rangers from the deck, or can tutor out combined power/toughness five creatures from the deck. I also included [Pendelhaven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven) to maximize the ability to go from 1/1 to 2/3, and put in [Sulfur Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Elemental), [Loaming Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loaming+Shaman), and [Golgari Brownscale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Brownscale) as 2/3 and 3/2 tutor targets. [Sulfur Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Elemental) and [Loaming Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loaming+Shaman) were conditionally useful as one-ofs against certain deck types, and [Golgari Brownscale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Brownscale) would give me a creature to recur for use with [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair).


To round out the deck, I added a [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus), because it's the "largest" 1/1 creature I could fetch with my 1/1 creatures. I also wanted to experiment with [Magus of the Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Library) - it combines really well with [Scryb Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger). [Scryb Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger) can return [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s to my hand to get my hand size back up to seven cards for [Magus of the Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Library) and can untap the Magus to allow me to produce two mana a turn or draw two cards a turn with the Magus.

 Out: 2 [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)


Game 1: Darknight1113 (B/W Control)  
 He gets stuck at two mana and gets run over. I get shenanigans with [Magus of the Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Library) and [Scryb Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger), draw several extra cards, and eventually drop [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) to the board. It doesn't affect the game much, because I am also able to drop several other creatures to the table and run him over before he gets to three mana.  
 Record: 1-0


### [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) Problem #1: It Can Be a Win-More Card!


This game illustrated the first problem with [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) - it's a classic "win-more" card. This means that by the time that you cast [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), you are already going to win the game - it only helps you win fancier, not better. In Game 1, I was already in control of the game. [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), in-and-of itself, does not do anything - you need other cards (namely, creatures) to get it working. Half the time, those creatures will already be winning you the game. [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus) only costs one more mana than [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) - why run [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) to fetch it with a 1/1 Elf when you could just add in three more copies of [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus) and be assured of having that 4/4 creature immediately?


![Angel of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Angel+of+Despair)
Game 2: JeffTaft (W/G/B Control)  
 This is a stock W/G/B control deck - [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), [Persecute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute), [Harmonize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harmonize), 12x *Ravnica* dual lands, Urborg, [Faith's Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters), [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) - the type of deck that wins Regionals, State Championships, and Pro Tours. For my part, I get an early [Scryb Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger) and throw [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) on it. I get him down to 6 before he starts coming back with [Faith's Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters) and [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch). I concede when he's back up to 16, with no cards in my hand to speak of thanks to being hit by [Persecute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute), and him on a full grip thanks to multiple [Harmonize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harmonize)s. I did get a fancy turn where I killed [Faith's Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters) with [Seal of Primordium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium), swung into an [Angel of Despair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair) with the Cloaked [Scryb Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger), and then played [Sulfur Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Elemental) to kill his Angel after damage. That's about the only highlight of this game.  
 Record: 1-1


Game 3: Dekzter (W/G/B Teneb/Reanimator)  
 Dekzter comes out to a fast start, getting an early [Zombify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify) on his Teneb, using [Greenseeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greenseeker) to discard his fatties and fetchlands to fix his mana. I get [Scryb Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger), [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), and [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair). He hits with Teneb and gets Jedit into play. I grab double [Scryb Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger) with [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), throw [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) on one of them, and then return all my [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s to my hand with my Rangers to allow me to kill Jedit. Unfortunately, Dekzter gets a draw with triple [Havenwood Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Havenwood+Wurm), and I can't deal with that much trample damage on the board.  
 Record: 1-2


To fix this, I retooled this first build to include a lot of fancy guys - 2/2 creatures, 0/0s that could have variable power/toughnesses, and [Phantom Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm). I had hopes that [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress) would still work well with [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), since [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) was an Enchantment itself. Unfortunately, I found that Enchantress just wasn't very compatible with [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) - you need a ton of creatures to make [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) worthwhile, and you need a ton of enchantments to make [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress) worthwhile. The two builds need an intense concentration of one type of card to get working, and since this is a [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) deck, creatures get the nod.

Game 4: Devilmon (Gauntlet of Might/[Wurmcalling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcalling) Mono-Green)  
 He gets a turn-five Gauntlet of Might set to green and then starts pumping out 12/12+ Wurms with [Wurmcalling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcalling). I play two [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair)s and start using [Scryb Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger) to grab other 2/2 creatures (remember, it gets +1/+1 from Devilmon's Gauntlet of Might!). I'm at 17 life, and I'm able to get a flyer to the board, plus two chump blockers a turn. I decide to let one Wurm go by to set up a two-turn clock on my end with flyers, but he has [Stonewood Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonewood+Invocation), and kills me in a single swing.  
 Record: 1-3


Game 5: Paparizzo (R/W Pro Tour Worlds deck)  
 This is an exact copy of one of the red-white decks that went undefeated at Worlds this past year. He gets a draw of double [Savannah Lions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions), [Icatian Javelineers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icatian+Javelineers), and [Soltari Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Priest). I get stuck at three mana, I have a bunch of four- and five-drop creatures in my hand (including [Shard Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix)), and I'm left wishing I had [Sulfur Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Elemental) anywhere in my deck, so I could shut down his entire board with one 3/2 creature.  
 Record: 1-4

![Keldon Marauders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Keldon+Marauders)
Game 6: Stephen451 (R/W [Keldon Marauders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders)/[Whitemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitemane+Lion) deck)  
 Stephen451 had a really neat deck that abused [Keldon Marauders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders) multiple times with [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink), [Whitemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitemane+Lion), and other bounce effects. The "deal 1 damage" effect of [Keldon Marauders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders) dealt a good 12 damage to me this game, but I got a sixth-turn [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), and then used [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) to fetch [Phantom Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm), which was promptly enchanted by [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak). Once enchanted by the Cloak, [Phantom Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm) was unkillable - damage is prevented whether a counter is actually removed or not, so with zero counters and a Cloak, [Phantom Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm) is a 5/3 creature that can't be killed by damage. It eventually goes the distance.  
 Record: 2-4


### [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) Lesson #1: KISS!


Over the course of game six, I had multiple instances of wanting to fetch either [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) or Mindless Automation with another 2/2 creature via [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), but never had the opportunity to do so thanks to the way that [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) works (as detailed above). I found that [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) definitely *didn't* work well if you had too many variable power/toughness creatures in your deck. That's what I mean by Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) - I tried to fit in as many power/toughness altering tricks as I could fit into one deck, and several times ended up in situations where I had painted myself into a corner and couldn't fetch what I really wanted. This lead me to retool the deck to a completely different second build. 


### Version #2: 1/1 Creatures

I rewound the deck back to where it first started, and decided to build around 1/1 (and 2/0) creatures - this way, I would be able to grab virtually any creature with any other creature. I also wanted to go with a toolbox build - a variety of creatures that I could grab situationally to help out with a specific board position.

You'll notice that in this build, I have two creatures that I can't get into play outside of either drawing [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl) or using [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair). [Draining Whelk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draining+Whelk) is specifically for use with [Scryb Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger) to act as a surprise [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), and [Harmonic Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harmonic+Sliver) as an answer for enchantments/artifacts. Because there is only one copy of each of these creatures in the deck, I shouldn't draw them very often, making them a safe inclusion in the deck.


### [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) Problem #2: You Need Creatures, Duh!


![Cloudstone Curio](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cloudstone+Curio)
[Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) is useless if you don't have creatures to play. This means that you need to stock up your deck with guys to fetch other guys. Unfortunately, as you remove creatures from your deck, you have less of a chance of drawing a creature to use with [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair)! The way I found to combat this was with [Cloudstone Curio](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudstone+Curio). Half the guys I get with [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) have a repeatable "comes-into-play" effect, and the Curio lets me cast a creature, stack the Curio effect, then the [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) effect, grab a guy with [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), stack the NEW Curio trigger, bounce my first guy with the second guy, and then bounce my second guy with the first guy! 


Game 1: Bozilla (5-Color [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair))  
 He gets [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) and [Farseek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) to [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), and then plays [Shivan Wumpus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Wumpus). I have three [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s, a hand full of green cards, and a bad mana base. I concede before I even see what his second creature would be.  
 Record: 0-1


Well, that's a little egg in my face - I took the needs of the previous deck (G/W Enchantress, which was equal parts green and white), and translated the mana base directly to the R/G [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) deck, without taking into account that this version of the deck had a grand total of ONE red card! I take out a bunch of [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s in favor of [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s.

Game 2: LordSanada (U/R Izzet)  
 I get [Magus of the Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Library), and I draw two cards with it before it bites an [Electrolyze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze). I try to play [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), and it gets counterspelled. LordSanada plays [Gelectrode](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gelectrode), and I drop [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus) and immediately remove a counter from it to kill his pinger. He drops [Wee Dragonauts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wee+Dragonauts), and I swing past it for 3. He plays five card-drawing spells to make his guy a 9/2, and then swings. I remove a counter from [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus), block his flyer, put damage on the stack, shoot it with the token that blocked it, remove the last counter from [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus), and then finish off his 1/3 creature. On my turn, I drop [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), pass the turn, and then play [Phantom Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm) on my following turn, fetching nothing (10 total power/toughness!). He drops [Gelectrode](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gelectrode)s in back-to-back turns, but I have [Silhana Ledgewalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silhana+Ledgewalker) to grab [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus) #2 to kill them both. [Phantom Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm) finishes this game off.  
 Record: 1-1


Game 3: Treetop (Mono-Green Beatdown)  
 He has turn one Birds, turn two [Yavimaya Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Dryad), and turn three [Blanchwood Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blanchwood+Armor). I have 2 [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse), a [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak), a [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl), a [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), and no creatures to be seen. His Dryad kills me in very, very short order.  
 Record: 1-2


I want a little more action in my deck, so I add in a few more red guys - [Sparkmage Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparkmage+Apprentice)s #2 and #3 to kill those pesky X/1 creatures I keep running up against, a [Scorched Rusalka](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scorched+Rusalka) to push through those last few points of damage, and [Mogg War Marshal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+War+Marshal) to have multiple blockers in one turn. I also up my [Magus of the Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Library) count to four, because so far it's drawn me a lot of extra cards between the two builds. I also put in a single Jedit as a fetch target for [Phantom Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm) (and because he's cool, duh!), and I up the Red mana count to account for the increased Red presence.

### [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) Lesson #2: 1/1 Creatures are 1/1 Creatures


One of the problems I had with this build is that 1/1 creatures are 1/1 creatures. For every [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus) that I could grab, that meant I had to play with a [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Scryb Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger), or [Magus of the Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Library). These guys might be great utility creatures, but they aren't particularly efficient for killing an opponent. [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) helps them some, but in order to reliably fetch other 1/1 creatures with [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), I need to be playing a lot of 1/1 creatures. 


### Version #3: 2/2 Creatures


The concept between the 2/2 creature build was the same as the 1/1 build, except with larger guys. 2/2 creatures are a lot sturdier than 1/1 creatures, and the ones currently available in Standard are a lot more exciting than the 1/1 creatures. [Thornscape Battlemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Battlemage) and [Shard Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix) both can kill opposing creatures, Sting*Scourge*r can bounce large threats, [Blood Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight) is good against white, [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) can help ramp up to six mana, [Gruul Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Guildmage) can make everyone bigger, and [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear) is the surprise guy. I also included one [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake) to interact with [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear), and one [Glint-Eye Nephilim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint-Eye+Nephilim) to act as a stylin' finisher. The other major inclusion in this deck are two [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling). While [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) won't trigger [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), it will let me tutor a situational creature directly into play.

![Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Viridian+Shaman)
Game 2: Noctourne81 (B/W/R Control)  
 He drops [Urborg Syphon-Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg+Syphon-Mage), and then starts hitting me with [Soul Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Feast) and [Lava Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Axe), while dropping multiple [Souls of the Faultless](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Souls+of+the+Faultless) to the board to stymie my attack. In this game, I learn just how ridiculous [Cloudstone Curio](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudstone+Curio) plus [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) can be. I use [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) to ramp up to six mana to play [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair). I then play [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders) to grab a second [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders), kill two of his lands, and bounce the first [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders) and my [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder). During my upkeep, I stack echo, play [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear) to bounce [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders), fetch another [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders), kill another land, use the [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders) to bounce [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear), play [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders) during my main phase to kill another land, fetch [Shard Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix), bounce both of my [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders). 


On my next turn, I sacrifice [Shard Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix), play [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear)s, grab another [Shard Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix), bounce [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear)s, use [Shard Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix) to kill his [Souls of the Faultless](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Souls+of+the+Faultless). On my upkeep, I return [Shard Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix) to my hand, cast it, fetch [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders), and hit him for two. By the next turn, he's facing down a horde of 2/2 creatures with no lands on the board, and no permanents other than two signets. I win the game handily at this point.  
 Record: 2-0


I had planned on having [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) in the deck, but somehow I forgot to include it! To fix this, out comes the [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake), and in goes [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman).

 In: 1 [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman)


Game 3: Skyhawk (R/W Slivers)  
 I play a third-turn [Cloudstone Curio](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudstone+Curio), and then play Sting*Scourge*r to bounce one of his Slivers. I'm all set to get a loop of [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear)/Sting*Scourge*r set up, when he plays [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain) out of nowhere (Who runs [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain) in a Sliver deck?), taking out my only [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), putting me under echo payment range and leaving me with only [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s for the rest of the very short game. I lose with double Avalanche Rider, double [Shard Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix), and [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) in my hand.  
 Record: 2-1


Game 4: Devlindice (U/B [Reality Acid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Acid))  
 I get [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) and double [Cloudstone Curio](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudstone+Curio). I then knock the beejeesus out of him with [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders), [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear), and [Shard Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix), recurring each of these guys a million times. This plays out similarly to Game 2, above.  
 Record: 3-1


Game 5: Maddprof (W/G Beatdown)  
 He leads with [Mire Boa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Boa), [Hedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedge+Troll), and [Watchwolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watchwolf). I have an [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear) and a [Cloudstone Curio](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudstone+Curio), but I misplay a [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl) as red instead of green. In a turn where I would have blocked with the Bear, used [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) to fetch Sting*Scourge*r, bounced my Bear, and bounced one of his guys, instead I block with [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear), look stupid with only one [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and one green creature on the board, and lose my guy and the game.  


![Null Profusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Null+Profusion) Record: 3-2
 Game 6: BrainBloodVolume (White Weenie)  
 He quickly knocks me down to six, while I get set up with [Cloudstone Curio](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudstone+Curio) and [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair). I throw in a couple of chump blocks with a pair of [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear)s early - I can drop a Bear, block one of his 2/2 flankers, and then bounce a bear with another bear thanks to the Curio. When I drop [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), I am able to get multiple [Shard Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix)es, ending his game plan of attacking with creatures. [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders) join the party over the next couple of turns, and in short order I complete the comeback.  
 Record: 4-2


Game 7: Gurgi ([Null Profusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Null+Profusion))  
 Gurgi is playing a [Null Profusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Null+Profusion) combo deck. I begin setting up my combo, but he gets a quicker draw with [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl), [Summer Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom), and [Null Profusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Null+Profusion). Once his enchantment is on the board, he is able to [Reclaim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclaim) and [Recollect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recollect)[Summer Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom) multiple times, allowing him to always be able to play lands for his Profusion. [Early Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) keeps his mana fresh, and I eventually die to back-to-back [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot)s for 12 and 13.

### [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) Lesson #3: Success Never Tasted So Sweet!


I have to admit - after several days trying to work out this deck on paper, and trying to work on the first two versions of this deck, I was very frustrated. There was nothing more satisfying then Game 2 of the 2-2 reboot. The deck finally came together in the fashion intended - [Cloudstone Curio](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudstone+Curio) allowing me to recur creatures for [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) working as a come-from-behind card rather than a win-more card, and the ability to play the deck both as beatdown and as control. If you're looking to play around with a [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) build, this third version (with the 2/2 creatures) is what I'd recommend!


Not that I didn't try one other deck…


### Version #4: Slivers!

I'll let this one speak for itself.


Game 1: LegendsDM (U/B Control)  
 He kills my first two [Spinneret Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spinneret+Sliver)s, and then I get, in order, [Firewake Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firewake+Sliver), [Gemhide Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemhide+Sliver), [Bonesplitter Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter+Sliver), and double [Might Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+Sliver), and run him over.  
 Record: 1-0


Game 2: Fink\_The\_Gobbo (R/W Control)  
 I get double [Might Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+Sliver) , [Gemhide Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemhide+Sliver), [Bonesplitter Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter+Sliver), and [Fury Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+Sliver). He dies horribly to 32 points of double strike damage.  
 Record: 2-0


Game 3: Zigawrath (B/G [Dredge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge))  
 I get run over with three [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) in hand, and 5 lands on the board. Frown!  
 Record: 2-1


Game 4: Greatwhite13 (Slivers)  
 We get the mirror match, and he comes through with a lethal [Fury Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+Sliver) backed by [Firewake Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firewake+Sliver) and 18 points of double-strike damage in one turn.

The problem with Slivers are that the ones that are good ([Bonesplitter Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter+Sliver), [Might Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+Sliver)) change the power/toughness of all Slivers. For instance, once you drop a [Might Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+Sliver) to the board, there are only two Slivers you can tutor for (Fury with a 1/1, and Battering with a 2/2). Without a power/toughness altering Sliver, the 1/1 Slivers can only grab other 1/1 Slivers, and it's the 2/2 Slivers (Might/[Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter)) that you really want to grab. Furthermore, Slivers are a curve deck - you want to drop Slivers on turn two, three, four, and five. If all goes well, you'd rather drop another Sliver (in hand) on turn six, not a six-drop enchantment. Moreoever, Slivers thrive off of Slivers. In my 2/2 build, I'd often hold back an [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear) for later use with [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) or [Cloudstone Curio](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudstone+Curio). In this deck, the more Slivers you get to the board, the more powerful all your Slivers get. In short, friends don't let friends drive Slivers with a [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) in hand!


As always, feedback and suggestions in the forums is appreciated! See you all next week, as we take the 2/2 build of [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), strip out the green, and start building a red-blue [Aeon Chronicler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler) deck. See you in seven!
