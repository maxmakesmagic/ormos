All of the *Coldsnap* Martyrs were concepted as spellcasters blowing dust from their palms into magical energy. The transforming dust represents the card’s activated ability going off, giving a visual cue to the similarities of the mechanical cycle. Each Martyr was illustrated by a different artist: [Martyr of Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Martyr%2Bof%2BSands), [Martyr of Frost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Martyr%2Bof%2BFrost), [Martyr of Ashes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Martyr%2Bof%2BAshes), [Martyr of Bones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Martyr%2Bof%2BBones), and [Martyr of Spores](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Martyr%2Bof%2BSpores).

Dan Scott chose to hide a little Easter egg in his finished art of [Martyr of Spores](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martyr+of+Spores). It’s a subtle reference to *Coldsnap’s* inclusion in Ice Age block. Can you find it?

The shaman in the picture is wearing a [Malachite Talisman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malachite+Talisman), an *Ice Age* artifact that triggers on green spells, around her neck.
