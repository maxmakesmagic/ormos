It is always unfortunate when we are obliged to pass on bad news, but two players have been disqualified without prize here at Japan Nationals 2011. During the final round of draft, the two players - Kazuya Mitamura and Yuuta Takahashi - were observed discussing the possibility of a concession. Following that discussion, an apparent concession occurred, which later one of the players attempted to rescind. Both players then agreed to restart the game. After a lengthy investigation, it was deemed necessary to disqualify both players for Cheating, with Takahashi additionally cited for Unsportsmanlike Conduct.


This statement was prepared by Level 3 Head Judge Naoaki Umesaki:


"*Magic* exists for everyone to have fun in a competitive but fair environment. It is never a pleasant duty when the DCI has to step in to ensure those standards are upheld, but there are times when that duty becomes necessary to protect the integrity of both the tournament and the game as a whole. The investigation into this matter was extensive, with all judges in full agreement that this was the only course of action available to us. The DCI will investigate further, and take any appropriate action in due course."
