Yesterday, we asked some of the more notable players in attendance here at Grand Prix Lille for their own tech, for what's special about their own deck or sideboard. Now we asked them whether they'd seen anything interesting in other people's decks …

**No. 21 Petr Sochůrek:** I've seen a lot of [Collective Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality), which seemed just like a generally sweet card. And my Ad Nauseam opponent played [Nephalia Academy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Academy) against me, so that my discard wouldn't cause any lasting damage!

**2015 World Magic Cup champion Simon Nielsen:** I heard that there was a mono-red [Skred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred) deck at 7-1!

**Gold-Level pro Grzegorz Kowalski:** I was playing next to a mono-blue mill deck. I looked over and I didn't recognize any of the cards except for the basic Islands!

**Gold-level pro Thomas Hendriks:** There's a Dutch guy who's playing a green-white Humans deck which was pretty interesting. It's aggressive but also has [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) and [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary)/[Retreat to Coralhelm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retreat+to+Coralhelm).

**Three-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor Jasper Grimmer:** I played against an [Eldritch Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldritch+Evolution) deck with [Coiling Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coiling+Oracle), [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence), and [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) for fodder, and tutor targets like [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) and [Glen Elendra Archmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glen+Elendra+Archmage), plus the combo of [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel) and [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker).
