The *Born of the Gods* Banned amp; Restricted update will be announced on February 3, 2014, which is the Monday after the *Born of the Gods* Prerelease. The changes, if there are any, will go into effect with the release of *Born of the Gods* on February 7, 2014.

This is the scheduling which [we announced](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/09202012a) on September 20, 2012 when we tied the updates to set releases. Due to internal scheduling needs we had moved that announcement a week forward for the past few sets. Those conflicts have been resolved and this scheduling will continue for the foreseeable future.
