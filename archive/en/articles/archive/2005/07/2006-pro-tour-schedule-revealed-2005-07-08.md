For almost 10 years, the Pro Tour has been the crowning jewel of the **Magic** tournament system. This upcoming birthday has led a number of us inside Wizards of the Coast to ask ourselves how we might be able to make it even better. Rather than rest on our laurels, we'd much prefer to make sure that the Pro Tour (and **Magic** in general) will be even more successful in its second decade than it was in its first. Some of those ideas have already been implemented -- the [Players Lounge](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/live-coverage-2005-pro-tour-nagoya-2005-01-28-2), the [Hall of Fame](/en/node/574031), and the [Pro Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/263), for example. Now in this article I have the privilege of revealing more of our improvements, starting off with making it easier for you to get to the Pro Tour.


Beginning with this fall's qualifier round (feeding the first Pro Tour stop of the 2006 season), all PTQs in North America, Latin America, the United Kingdom and the APAC region will be switching over to the system already in place in most of Europe -- winners will receive plane tickets to the event instead of travel awards. We found that $250 or $500 just wasn't enough to get many players to most events, so instead we're taking care of your flight arrangements for you. In addition, with four PTs on the schedule now, each PTQ season will be extended by a few weeks so that the overall number of qualifiers each year can be kept constant. Between free airplane tickets and more ways to qualify for each event, hopefully many more players will be able to enjoy our new and improved Pro Tour.


Now that we're setting up your travel, you probably want to know where you're going. How does Hawaii sound, for starters?


### 2006 Pro Tour and PTQ Schedule




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Date** | **Location** | **Format** |
| March 3-5 | Pro Tour-Honolulu
 Qualifiers: Extended, October - December | Standard Constructed |
| April/May | Pro Tour TBD (tentatively Europe)
 Qualifiers: Sealed/Booster Draft, January - March | Ravnica-Guildpact Booster Draft |
| June/July | Pro Tour TBD (Japan or US)
 Qualifiers: Team Standard Constructed, March - May | Team Ravnica-Block Constructed |
| October | Pro Tour TBD (US or Japan)
 Qualifiers: Sealed/Booster Draft, June - August | [Snap] Booster Draft |
| Nov 29-Dec 3 | Worlds - Paris | Standard, Extended, [Snap] Draft |

There's a lot of new stuff to talk about there, but I'll start with the most obvious change – yes, there are only four Pro Tours (plus Worlds). First things first, we are redistributing all the prize money from the “missing” Pro Tour onto the other five events so there will be no dip in prizes. Here's a sneak peek at the new payouts:

| **6** | $11,000 | **21** | $2,600 | **36** | $1,150 | **51** | $645 | **66** | $490 |

| **8** | $10,000 | **23** | $2,200 | **38** | $1,050 | **53** | $620 | **68** | $470 |
| **9** | $7,000 | **24** | $2,000 | **39** | $1,000 | **54** | $610 | **69** | $460 |
| **10** | $6,500 | **25** | $1,900 | **40** | $950 | **55** | $600 | **70** | $450 |
| **11** | $6,000 | **26** | $1,800 | **41** | $900 | **56** | $590 | **71** | $440 |
| **12** | $5,500 | **27** | $1,700 | **42** | $850 | **57** | $580 | **72** | $430 |
| **13** | $5,000 | **28** | $1,600 | **43** | $800 | **58** | $570 | **73** | $420 |
| **14** | $4,500 | **29** | $1,500 | **44** | $775 | **59** | $560 | **74** | $410 |
| **15** | $4,000 | **30** | $1,450 | **45** | $750 | **60** | $550 | **75** | $400 |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **Total**: | $255,245 |

In addition, we are also redistributing all the production costs of the missing Pro Tour onto the other five events. This isn't any kind of a cost-saving move, it's just that we honestly think everyone will be better off if there's one fewer event. We're going to take the money that we would normally spend on the fifth Pro Tour stop and use it to make everything else more special.




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Players Club Thresholds**
 With one fewer Pro Tour each year, we're lowering many of the Pro Point thresholds necessary to “level up” in the Pro Players Club:
 

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | **2005 Pro Points** | **2006 Pro Points** |
| **Level 1** | 1 | 1 |
| **Level 2** | 10 | 10 |
| **Level 3** | 20 | 20 |
| **Level 4** | 35 | 30 |
| **Level 5** | 50 | 40 |
| **Level 6** | 65 | 50 |

 |

One way to make each Pro Tour special is to have fewer of them. This eases the travel burden on players and also allows us to make each one unique. Another way to make each Pro Tour special is to have them at more interesting sites and in more exotic locations. Pro Tours at places such as Hawaii are a sign of things to come -- we plan to single out one Pro Tour each season to hold in a similarly exotic location. On top of that, we will seek out more vacation-friendly locations for our other events. Worlds, for example, is not just in Paris, but it's actually going to be held at the Louvre. We also have a lot of other ideas about how to make the events themselves more unique, which we'll be unveiling event by event as the year progresses.


Another big change on display in the 2006 schedule is that we've decide to “hand roll” the formats for each year. We used to have the same formats every year (Extended, Block Constructed, Booster Draft, Rochester Draft, and Team Rochester Draft), but moving forward we're going to mix things up. Some years (like 2006) we'll throw in a Standard Pro Tour and/or qualifying round. Other years we won't. Note that 2006 also has a Team Constructed Pro Tour, which is something that has never happened on Tour before. Team Constructed will use three-person teams plus the constraint that your decks still must be legal if stacked on top of each other (that is to say, no more than 4 total copies of Tooth and Nail across all three decks). We plan to cook up new challenges like this for our players each and every season from now on.


  
*Let us pay your way to Hawaii.*
The first stop in the 2006 season really sums up a lot of what the year will be like – we're having a Standard Pro Tour (for the first time since 1999) and we're doing it in Hawaii and we're giving away airline tickets to get you there. It should be an awesome year.
