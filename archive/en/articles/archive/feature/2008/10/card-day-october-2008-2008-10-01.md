![All Hallow's Eve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=All+Hallow%27s+Eve)**[All Hallow's Eve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Hallow%27s+Eve)** – *Legends* rare. Happy Halloween! Here's a scaaaary tidbit that's been resurrected from the dead (by which we mean "March 2002", when it was already used as Card of the Day): "[All Hallow's Eve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Hallow%27s+Eve) is one of a very few cards to be printed with the wrong card type. It says "Sorcery," but has been officially errataed to "Enchantment" since it remains in play for two turns." It's since been made back into a Sorcery, thanks to the technology behind the Suspend mechanic!
 ![Buried Alive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=buried+alive)**[Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive)** – *Weatherlight* uncommon. In 1997, decks featuring [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) and [Ashen Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen+Ghoul) were extremely powerful. Even Jon Finkel, piloting a Counterpost deck specifically designed to beat that strategy, lost at the United States Nationals to Brian Kibler's Buried Alive deck, thanks to Kibler's secret sideboard tech: [Armageddon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon), which devastated Finkel's [Thawing Glaciers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thawing+Glaciers)-enhanced mana base.
 ![Fallen Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fallen+Angel)**[Fallen Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Angel)** – *Legends* uncommon. After appearing in *Legends* and *Chronicles*, [Fallen Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Angel) was in every core set from *Fifth* to *Eighth Edition*. It had a shot at being in *Tenth Edition*, but the Selecting *Tenth Edition* vote went for [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) instead.
 ![Treachery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Treachery)**[Treachery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery)** – *Urza's Destiny* rare. At ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif), [Treachery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery) costs one more mana than [Control Magic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic). For this extra cost, the reward is that you get to untap up to five lands, making the card free. Or better than free, if you have lands that tap for more than one mana. This turned out to be too good.
 ![Battlegrace Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Battlegrace+Angel)**[Battlegrace Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlegrace+Angel)** – *Shards of Alara* rare. The small leaflike things surrounding the [Battlegrace Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlegrace+Angel) are the sigils of Bant. They're also visible on [Rhox War Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+War+Monk).
 ![Scourge Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scourge+Devil)**[Scourge Devil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+Devil)** – *Shards of Alara* uncommon. Devils on Grixis are small, not that smart, and exceedingly sadistic. In order for the demons to rely on the devils' loyalty, a fresh supply of helpless victims is always necessary.
 ![Blightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blightning)**[Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning)** – *Shards of Alara* common. According to the flavor text of [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning), the smell of smoldering brain matter is a rare treat. This, of course, makes perfect sense given the number of zombies on Grixis. Everyone knows that there's nothing zombies like better than some nice juicy brains!
 ![Corpse Connoisseur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Corpse+Connoisseur)**[Corpse Connoisseur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Connoisseur)** – *Shards of Alara* uncommon. The [Corpse Connoisseur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Connoisseur) is not just a corpse who is a connoisseur; he's also a connoisseur of corpses. Compare this to [Fleshbag Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshbag+Marauder), who, as far as we know, does not maraud fleshbags.
 ![Sedris, the Traitor King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sedris%2C+the+Traitor+King)**[Sedris the Traitor King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedris+the+Traitor+King)** – *Shards of Alara* mythic rare. Sedris was the last living ruler of Vithia, but sold his kingdom and his soul to the first demon lords. Now, he rules as a powerful lich over the land known as "Grixis"—Vithian for "Traitor".
 ![Archdemon of Unx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Archdemon+of+Unx)**[Archdemon of Unx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archdemon+of+Unx)** – *Shards of Alara* rare. "Unx" is the site of a deep hole in the crust of Grixis. It was once a grand stadium but now spawns only pain. And archdemons. And also skittering skeleton-things.
 ![Yoked Plowbeast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Yoked+Plowbeast)**[Yoked Plowbeast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yoked+Plowbeast)** – *Shards of Alara* common. While the elves look on the gargantuans of Naya with awe, the humans are more down-to-earth. The [Yoked Plowbeast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yoked+Plowbeast) exemplifies the humans' approach to these massive creatures.
 ![Godtoucher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Godtoucher)**[Godtoucher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godtoucher)** – *Shards of Alara* common. [Godtoucher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godtoucher)s are the most honored among the elves of Naya, because they are the ones who are actually in contact with the gargantuans the elves worship. The godtouchers convey the gargantuans' wishes to the other elves, who live according to these guidelines.
 ![Tortoise Formation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tortoise+Formation)**[Tortoise Formation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tortoise+Formation)** – *Shards of Alara* common. [Tortoise Formation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tortoise+Formation) is another of those cards with a literal twist in its name. It's not only the classical *Testudo*—a favorite of the ancient Roman army—it's also made *out of tortoises*!
 ![Viashino Skeleton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Viashino+Skeleton)**[Viashino Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Skeleton)** – *Shards of Alara* common. Although the Viashino are no longer native to Grixis, their skeletons still remain from before the Sundering. This probably applies to the other shards too, but they're less likely to be digging around looking for skeletons to animate. It doesn't seem quite fair that a skeleton can get [Skeletonize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletonize)d, does it?
 ![Sharuum the Hegemon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sharuum+the+Hegemon)**[Sharuum the Hegemon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sharuum+the+Hegemon)** – *Shards of Alara* mythic rare. For [Sharuum the Hegemon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sharuum+the+Hegemon), being Legendary is not a drawback. Not only can two Sharuums create an infinite loop (when the second one comes into play, both are sent to the graveyard, then one can come back into play, potentially bringing back the other one), they can even be played if one's already in play on the other side of the table (again, since the "return an artifact to play" trigger" will still be there after both die).
 ![Freyalise Supplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Freyalise+Supplicant)**[Freyalise Supplicant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Freyalise+Supplicant)** – *Ice Age* uncommon. Freyalise was a planeswalker back in the *Ice Age* storyline, where she appeared in four card titles and twelve pieces of flavor text (11 in *Ice Age* and one in *Alliances*). Since then, she's also showed up in [*Coldsnap*](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=Freyalise&Field_Flavor=on&setfilter=Coldsnap&output=Spoiler), [*Time Spiral* Block](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=Freyalise&Field_Flavor=on&setfilter=Time%20Spiral%20Block&output=Spoiler), and even a few times in [*Invasion* block](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=Freyalise&Field_Flavor=on&setfilter=Invasion%20Block&output=Spoiler).
 ![Loxodon Warhammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Loxodon+Warhammer)**[Loxodon Warhammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer)** – *Ninth Edition* rare. When it was originally printed in *Mirrodin*, [Loxodon Warhammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer) was an uncommon. But when it was put into *Ninth Edition*, it was bumped to rare, largely because of its effect on drafts.
 ![Raven Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Raven+Familiar)**[Raven Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raven+Familiar)** – *Urza's Legacy* uncommon. The raven in the art of [Raven Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raven+Familiar) is using magic granted to it by its master, a professor at [Tolarian Academy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Academy). As the professor's eye glows with magic, that same glint appears in the raven's tiny eye.
 ![Tyrranax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tyrranax)**[Tyrranax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tyrranax)** – *Fifth Dawn* common. The [Tyrranax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tyrranax) is a large (10 feet tall and 25 feet high, according to the art description) beast that lives in the Tangle, the twisted forest from which the green sun burst forth at the end of *Darksteel* and launching the *Fifth Dawn*.
 ![Moonhold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Moonhold)**[Moonhold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonhold)** – *Eventide* uncommon. The art for [Moonhold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonhold) shows time completely stopping. As the area inside the circle has magically frozen, a rip in reality has been created. Luckily for these goblins, things return to normal shortly. But what does "shortly" mean to the one inside the frozen time?
 ![Iname as One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Iname+as+One)**[Iname as One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iname+as+One)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* rare. The two versions of Iname in *Champions of Kamigawa* are the incarnations of [Iname, Life Aspect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Iname%252C%2BLife%2BAspect) and [Iname, Death Aspect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Iname%252C%2BDeath%2BAspect). And what happens when That Which Brings Life and That Which Takes Life are combined? Well, pretty much both cards at once. Instead of paying ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) and ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) for two 4/4s that provide spirits from your library and graveyard, you pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220908064341im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless8.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) for an 8/8 that does it!
 ![Rhys the Redeemed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rhys+the+Redeemed)**[Rhys the Redeemed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhys+the+Redeemed)** – *Shadowmoor* rare. Rhys wasn't "redeemed" in the normal sense, because this version of him never knew about [Rhys the Exiled](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhys+the+Exiled). Instead, we, the audience, got to see what he would have been like in a society built around mutual support.
 ![Ertai the Corrupted](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ertai+the+Corrupted)**[Ertai the Corrupted](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ertai+the+Corrupted)** – *Planeshift* rare. Ertai changed from his original [Ertai, Wizard Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ertai%252C%2BWizard%2BAdept) form when he sacrificed himself to hold open an [Erratic Portal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Portal) to save the *Weatherlight* and its crew from Rath. The twisted, evil version of Ertai was eventually destroyed by [Squee, Goblin Nabob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Squee%252C%2BGoblin%2BNabob) by accident.
