Jacob Wilson is First in the Second City!
=========================================




November 10-11, 2012












Grand Prix Chicago 2012
-----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpchi12/gpchi12-trophy.jpg)Jacob Wilson is the champion of Grand Prix Chicago 2012! After three consecutive finishes just shy of Top 8, Wilson managed to pilot his updated Jund list to a breakthrough, making it through the Top 8 and into a 74-card mirror match against Josh Utter-Leyton. After a close, tense match, the top of Wilson's deck proved very merciful, providing exactly what he needed to tear the final game away from Utter-Leyton.


While it's hard to ignore the fact that two Jund decks made the finals, or that Jund won yet another Modern event, the fact remains that there were seven different decks in the Top 8 and eleven in the Top 16. Modern is a wide open format, where you can play anything. From innovations in existing archetypes to new players on the scene, Grand Prix Chicago was incredibly entertaining from start to finish, and a testament to deckbuilders everywhere.
