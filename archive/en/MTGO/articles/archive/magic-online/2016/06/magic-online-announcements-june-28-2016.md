**Legacy Festival "Assemble" Phase: *Eternal Masters* Events**


*Magic Online* has festivals to celebrate a format and its players, as well as to encourage others to join in on the fun. Interested in playing Legacy but haven't given it a try? Already play and want to get your friends to join you? This festival is the time! The Legacy Festival will walk players through the essential steps to discovering a format:

* **ASSEMBLE (JUNE 16–JULY 6):** Play the new *Eternal Masters* set for an an opportunity to acquire cards you'll need for your deck.
* CONQUER (JULY 6–JULY 24): Once you've gotten your deck together, a way to play for some sweet prizes when you jump in and take on the competition. From July 6–24, the Competitive Legacy League can qualify players for the Legacy Festival Championship! Double your chances for qualification by shooting for the Top 16 in the Legacy Challenge on July 9!
