Both Emmanuel Vernay and Patrick Mello can afford to breathe fairly easily. At 7-0 they are both almost certs to make day two. Now it's a question of just how well they can set themselves up for Sunday. 

Like a lot of the French Vernay had chosen to run Suicide Black. Unfortunately for him Mello was running Piledriver Sligh, a matchup firmly in favor of the German.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a949.jpg)Compounded on top of this Vernay chose to play a one swamp hand and his deck stubbornly refused to cough up another. He was still able summon two [Carnophage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnophage) and attempt a [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), which missed.

Unfortunately Mello had two [Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver)s and a [Reckless Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge). Two swings for nine and the Frenchman was shuffling up for game 2.

Mello 1-0 Vernay

Vernay didn't have a turn 1 play in game 2 but was able to Edict away Mello's Lackey. Mello followed with [Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire) and [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic). Then the Frenchman found one of his sideboard cards as [Engineered Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) on Goblins made things difficult. The German didn't play a spell on turns three and four and a [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) revealed a hand of two [Lava Dart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Dart), [Reckless Abandon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Abandon) and a useless [Raging Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Goblin). Unsurprisingly the Fiend didn't trouble the board for too long leaving both players with a bunch of land and, crucially, the [Engineered Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague).

Vernay dropped a [Skittering Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skittering+Skirge). Mello disposed of it with Abandon on a Piledriver. A [Barbarian Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Ring) took care of a [Sarcomancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomancy) token and perhaps gave the German a win mechanism as the residual enchantment started leeching Vernay's life. A second [Sarcomancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomancy) doubled the pain as Mello drew a scroll and bashed the Zombie off the board.

A Negator rolled up and turned the game round again, putting Mello in an awkward situation. Any damage to the Negator would give him an outlet to sacrifice the damaging [Sarcomancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomancy) enchantments. But could he just take 5 damage a turn?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a950.jpg)Vernay made another [Sarcomancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomancy) and Mello pondered the situation in his end step. He decided to play it safe and went after the Negator. The Frenchman sacrificed two residual [Sarcomancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomancy)'s. Mello scrolled it again in his main phase leaving Vernay a lot to consider.

The Negator took itself and the remaining [Sarcomancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomancy) off the table, leaving Mello in control with a [Cursed Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll).

Another Negator appeared and got whacked about a bit by the [Cursed Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll). Vernay wanted to keep it and chose to lose two land. He was hoping to end the game in a few quick hits before Mello de-permanented him completely.

Unfortunately the Frenchman had forgotten about the two [Lava Dart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Dart)s in Mello's graveyard. Mello realizing this had delayed flashing them back until Vernay had dropped himself to just one swamp. From there it was too far back for the Frenchman.

**Final Result:** Patrick Mello beat Emmanuel Vernay 2-0
