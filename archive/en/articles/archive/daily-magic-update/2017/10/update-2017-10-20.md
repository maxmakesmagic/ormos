The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 20, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by the weekend. Just like every other Friday ever.


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [StarCityGames.com Cincinnati Open](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/211017_cincinnati_fact_sheet.html) | [twitch.tv/scgtour](https://go.twitch.tv/scgtour) | Saturday and Sunday at 7:30 a.m. PT/10:30 a.m. ET/2:30 p.m. UTC

More Modern spotlighting as the SCG Open winds its way to Cincinnati. Cedric Phillips and Patrick Sullivan have control of the microphones, so expect plenty of references to Kithkin and burn decks. Plus some solid commentary.


1. Eternal Weekend | [twitch.tv/cardtitan](https://go.twitch.tv/cardtitan) | Today through Sunday, starting "around 11 a.m. to noon" ET/8–9 a.m. PT/3–4 p.m. UTC

Details are a bit fuzzy on what and when exactly streaming will happen each day for Eternal Weekend, but [it will happen](https://twitter.com/Card_Titan/status/921191134029844480) and it is currently happening! Right now! Watch people casually flip *Limited Edition (Beta)* [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) and *Limited Edition (Alpha)* [Mox Sapphire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Sapphire)s onto the table as the oldest of the old gets its time to shine.


Top 25
======


1. The Nationals Bump

The big movers this week were also two of the big winners over Nationals weekend, where Carlos Romão and Gerry Thompson each made their respective national teams and, as a result, got a sizeable bump in the Top 25.

After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [How to Approach Sunbird's Invocation](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/sunbirds-invocation/) | Top Level Podcast | Mike Flores and Patrick Chapin

Did you have any doubt these two would note the new deck with the weird enchantment and an "I win" combo? I didn't. Sure, they cover other decks, but they certainly focus on the newest way to approach some suns. And rightfully so.


1. [Vintage 101: Everybody's Working for the (Eternal) Weekend](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/vintage-101-everybody-s-working-for-the-eternal-weekend?src=wizards) | MTGGoldFish | IslandSwamp

If you do end up watching some Vintage this weekend, maybe a guide would help, perhaps? IslandSwamp has you covered, with a look back at last year's champs and a run-through of what archetypes could show up this year.


1. [Modern: The Worst It's Ever Been?](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36037_Modern-The-Worst-Its-Ever-Been.html) | StarCityGames.com | Brennan DeCandio

In what is sure to be a controversial-ish article, DeCandio posits that Modern is great—unless you want to play it competitively. He claims that wide-open does not equal "good competitive format," and talks about why. Sharpen those pitchforks, Modern lovers!


1. [Point Changes Effective Oct. 23, 2017](https://canadianhighlander.wordpress.com/) | Canadian Highlander

Canadian Highlander recently dropped a bunch of point values for cards. That means my [Oath of Druids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) deck has a free point to work with! And Lim-Dul's Vault doesn't have to be that card! It could be [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) or [Mind Twist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Twist) or, ooh, [Tainted Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Pact)! The options are, well, not endless. They're actually pretty discrete.


No idea what I'm talking about? Check out this [Introduction to Canadian Highlander](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ways-play/introduction-canadian-highlander-2016-05-17) (with soon to be outdated point totals), or [this explanation](https://canadianhighlander.wordpress.com/intro-to-format/) from the folks who run the format.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [#FridayMTG](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FridayMTG?src=hash)

We've highlighted this before, but it's Friday and I'm thrilled about that, so let's celebrate. This is a hashtag where you can find a lot of community members celebrating smaller content creators. Check them out if you have the time.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Dagger Burned](https://clips.twitch.tv/ArtsyStylishWebPupper)

SaffronOlive is knocking some decks out of the park this week, and [this clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/ArtsyStylishWebPupper) is a good example of why. You can watch [the full stream replay here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/183513448).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Vintage Dredge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLxg8UAfS2YJYbwb58J-EgAVYodXM9JdRH&v=4LBPeVBjtro) | TCGplayer | Steve Rubin

Those are some dirty words strung together—and it's an experience that only kind of resembles the *Magic* you're most likely used to playing. I mean, any deck that makes [Hollow One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hollow+One) and [Dragonlord Kolaghan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Kolaghan) all-stars at the same time has got to be doing some weird stuff.


But, hey, it's Eternal Weekend, so let's break out a little bit of weird and take a look at a deck that's going to lead to confusing board states on stream all weekend long.
