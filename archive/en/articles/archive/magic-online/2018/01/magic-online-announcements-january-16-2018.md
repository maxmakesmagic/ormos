We Fixed Ninjutsu!
------------------


A bug that was preventing the ninjutsu ability from functioning on cards like [Ninja of the Deep Hours](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours) has been fixed. Now all your Ninjas can poof in and out of combat like they were always meant to!
