**Downtime for October 21, 2015**


Over the past several weeks, we have been working to address the lag that players have experienced as *Magic Online* returns from downtime. To safeguard against further issues, we will be returning from the October 21 downtime with some functionality disables—players will not be able to enter into events gated by an entry option or trade with other players. Once we've ensured that any possible lag issues have passed, we will return events and trades to their full functionality and notify players via the *Magic Online* Home Scene and the [*Magic Online* Twitter account](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline).


* All tournaments will close Wednesday, October 21, at 5:00 a.m. Pacific (12:00 UTC)
* Store and trade activity will be suspended at approximately 7:45 a.m. Pacific (14:45 UTC)
* The system will be down from 8:00 a.m. Pacific (15:00 UTC) until 12:00 p.m. Pacific (19:00 UTC)

***Magic Online* Store Inventory Changes**


Keeping the *Magic Online* Store fresh and up to date is important. Preventing players from having to browse through long lists of older products to find the items they want helps reduce frustration and ensure that store offerings are kept relevant. With this in mind, the *Magic Online* Store will be updated during the Wednesda, October 28 downtime, removing a number of the earlier Commander decks from sale. All five *Commander (2014 Edition)* decks will remain on sale (Forged In Stone, Peer Through Time, Sworn To Darkness, Built From Scratch, and Guided By Nature), but the ten decks from *Commander (2011 Edition)* and *Commander (2013 Edition)* will be removed when the downtime ends.

***Battle for Zendikar* Known Issues**


 


* [Kiora, Master of the Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+Master+of+the+Depths)’s second loyalty ability does not properly put all cards into the player’s Revealed Cards area.
* When a card with the devoid ability is given a color (perhaps by a [Painter's Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant)), it appears with distorted art.
* Converge cards do not indicate how many colors of mana were spent to cast the spell.
* Cards put into the graveyard with [Kiora, Master of the Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+Master+of+the+Depths)’s second loyalty ability do not properly trigger the second ability of [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant).
* The prompt box displays the incorrect color during the “scry-like” step in the new mulligan process.
* Several *Battle for Zendikar* promo cards appear with the incorrect set symbol.
* [Oblivion Sower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Sower)’s triggered ability incorrectly allows a player to select an face down exiled land card.
* When [Chasm Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chasm+Guide)’s triggered ability is triggered by [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar), it will appear with incorrect art on the stack.
* Cards that are exiled by [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) incorrectly show association arrows while in the Exiled Zone.
* In the Collection scene, the filter for the *From the Vault: Angels* set appears out of place (above *Battle for Zendikar* instead of with the other *From the Vault* sets).
* When [Entreat the Angels](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) is on the stack with 0 chosen for X, the blue text that typically indicates the value of X does not appear.
* The Ingest keyword ability displays extraneous text in the game log when resolving.
* The landfall ability of [Emeria Shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Shepherd) is not optional.
* Mana generated by [Shrine of the Forsaken Gods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+the+Forsaken+Gods)’s second ability can’t be spent on face-down creature spells.
