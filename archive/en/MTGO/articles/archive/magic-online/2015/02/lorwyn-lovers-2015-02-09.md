You know what a good Valentine's Day destination is? Lorwyn. A plane of intense beauty, Lorwyn is a place where the sun never even dips below the horizon—stalling before it does in a perfect sunset, then rising back into the sky. I think we can all agree that would be a great place for a Valentine's Day picnic or something. Of course, the elves on Lorwyn kill anything that they deem unattractive, which is everything that's not an elf. They'll even kill an elf if they decide it's too ugly. Seriously. They call ugly elves/non-elves eyeblight and they hunt down eyeblight in packs. Check out this flavor text.

Yikes.


So maybe don't go to Lorwyn.


But we can dream, can't we? And what better way to experience the beautiful plane of Lorwyn than with Phantom *Lorwyn* Sealed? Heck, bring that special someone along! Or, play some Sealed solo. Historically speaking, not having a girlfriend has never stopped me from eating heart-shaped cookies, that's for darn sure, and this is no different. So stop on by beginning Friday, February 13, 10:00 a.m. Pacific (UTC-8) to play Sealed in the summery splendor of Lorwyn. Events come to a close on Monday, February 16, so make sure you try this event out while you have the chance.


Happy Valentine's Day, *Magic Online*!
