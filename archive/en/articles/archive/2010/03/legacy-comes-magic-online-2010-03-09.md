If you haven't heard, Legacy has become one of **Magic**'s most popular formats. Aaron Forsythe let you know it was coming in his [From the Director's Chair](/en/articles/archive/directors-chair-2010-2010-01-04-0) article. And if you have been paying any attention to what has been happening in the [Legacy scene](/en/events/coverage/m%C3%BCller-magical-madrid), then this announcement really isn't a surprise at all.


We are pleased to announce the Legacy Format will debut on **Magic Online** as a new Core Format following the scheduled downtime on Wednesday, March 31. At that time, Legacy 2-player queues, 8-player queues, Daily Events, and Premier Events will all be scheduled.


At the same time, Classic will become a Specialty Format. Classic will permanently replace the Player's Choice format in the 2-player queues and Weekend Challenge rotation. To honor Classic's contribution to **Magic Online**, however, we will hold a weeklong celebration from 3/17 to 3/24 with a full [schedule](/en/articles/archive/2009-07-14) of reduced ticket events leading up to Classic's first Weekend Challenge on March 27.


Classic Celebration events begin after the downtime Wednesday, March 17 through March 23 and will consist of four parts:


* Reduced Event Ticket entry fee on the 8-player Classic queue, from 6 to 4 tickets.
* Reduced Event Ticket entry fee on Classic Daily Events, from 6 to 4 tickets.
* Reduced Event Ticket entry fee on Classic Premier Events, from 10 to 8 tickets.
* *Masters Edition III* Prizes. Starting after the downtime on March 17, all Classic event prize payouts (Classic 2-player, Classic 8-player, Classic Daily Event and Classic Premier Event) will switch from Tempest block to Masters Edition III booster packs. In addition, some events will award a textless alternate art Psionic Blast promo card.
