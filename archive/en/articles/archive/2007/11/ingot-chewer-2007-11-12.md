*Lorwyn*'s[Ingot Chewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ingot+Chewer) is a "greater elemental," an ethereal manifestation of an idea or daydream of Lorwyn in the form of a surreal combination of animal elements. [Ingot Chewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ingot+Chewer) has some characteristics of an enormous mole rat, including blunt claws that is uses to dig through Lorwyn's crust in search of metal morsels (ingots) to devour.


Originally [Ingot Chewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ingot+Chewer) was going to be named "Ingot Smasher." But there was a problem with that name.


To date, **Magic** has only had one other "Ingot" card. It is an artifact, which is relevant to [Ingot Chewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ingot+Chewer)'s artifact-smashing ability—but it's indestructible.

[Ingot Chewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ingot+Chewer) isn't capable of destroying [Darksteel Ingot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) – it can only gnaw on it a little. That's how [Ingot Chewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ingot+Chewer) got its name.
