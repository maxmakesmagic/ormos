Welcome to the fifth week of [Selecting *Ninth Edition*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/selecting9e/home)! This week we'll be adding in the art votes in addition to the card vs. card votes. But before we get to that, let's find out what happened with last week's [duel of the demons](/en/articles/archive/selecting-ninth-edition-week-4-2004-07-05).

### Card Vote #5


This week we're throwing a new twist at you. Rather than voting for one card or the other, this time you'll have to make a more difficult decision.


For this week's first vote, you've got the choice to lock in either [Confiscate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscate) and [Rewind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rewind), or just [Persuasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion). In the *Urza's Saga* corner we've got [Rewind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rewind) and [Confiscate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscate), two cards that both made it into *Eighth Edition*. As a "hard counter" [Rewind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rewind) has been seeing tournament play, and [Confiscate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscate) has the ability to steal permanents rather than just creatures for just one mana more than the contender. Pitted against the two veterans is lone card [Persuasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion). [Control Magic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic) was one of the most feared anti-creature measures in the game's history, and at just one mana more [Persuasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion) is still very powerful and is sure to be a popular option for tournament and casual players alike. Though [Persuasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion) saw plenty of tournament play in its day it's never had the chance to come back in a core set.


Which group will it be? The choice is yours.

### Sketch Vote #1


For Selecting *Ninth Edition* we're offering a whole new way to have your say. This time we'll be taking one card at a time from the next core set, pitting artist against artist, sketch against sketch, for your voting pleasure. The winning sketch for each card gets fleshed out into the final artwork for that card, and it's the readers of **magicthegathering.com** that get to make the choice!


This week's vote features [Dancing Scimitar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dancing+Scimitar) and sketches by Ron Spears and Jim Nelson.

Thanks for making your voice heard. We’ll see you next Monday (and every Monday through September 6th) with even more important changes to your next Core Set. Don’t miss it!
