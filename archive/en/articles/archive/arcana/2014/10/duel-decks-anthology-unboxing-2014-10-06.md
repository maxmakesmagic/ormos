We've still got a bit of time until *Duel Decks: Anthology* releases on December 5, but we also know 'tis the season of planning ahead on presents. And while we've [long-since announced the product](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/announcing-duel-decks-anthology-2014-08-07), and it's far from a secret what cards are in each of the included Duel Decks, the entire package is just soâ€¦*cool*.


So cool, in fact, that we couldn't wait to show it off to you. So if you're looking to get a sense of the contents within *Duel Decks: Anthology*, look no further.
