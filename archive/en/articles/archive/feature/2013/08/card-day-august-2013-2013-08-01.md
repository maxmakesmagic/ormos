![Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster)
  
**[Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster)** – ***Magic** 2014*. Before we jump in *Theros* previews this weekend, we wanted to shine a spotlight on ***Magic** 2014*'s focus Planeswalker, Chandra Nalaar. Back in July, Gavin Verhey [reconstructed a deck](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/257) that featured not just [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster), but most of the cards from this week as well. Check it out! 
 


![Chandra's Outrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chandra%27s+Outrage)
  
**[Chandra's Outrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage)** – ***Magic** 2014*. Before we jump in *Theros* previews this weekend, we wanted to shine a spotlight on ***Magic** 2014*'s focus Planeswalker, Chandra Nalaar. Including the Outrage, there are [ten red common instants with a converted mana cost of 4 that deal damage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&color=+%5BR%5D&cmc=+%3d%5B4%5D&rarity=+%5BC%5D&text=+%5Bdamage%5D+%5Bdeals%5D&format=+!%5B%22Un-Sets%22%5D&type=+%5B%22Instant%22%5D). Of those, only [Chandra's Outrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage) and [Magma Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Burst) (if you pay the kicker) are "guaranteed" (as much as can be in **Magic**) to deal 6 points of damage, and both spread that damage over two targets. 
 


![Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix)
  
**[Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix)** – ***Magic** 2014*. Before we jump in *Theros* previews this weekend, we wanted to shine a spotlight on ***Magic** 2014*'s focus Planeswalker, Chandra Nalaar. There are [nine Phoenixes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&name=+%5BPhoenix%5D&subtype=+%5B%22Phoenix%22%5D) in **Magic**, all of them in red, and all of them with some form of recursion (as you'd expect!), with [Firestorm Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firestorm+Phoenix), from *Legends*, being the first. 
 


![Pyromancer's Gauntlet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pyromancer%27s+Gauntlet)
  
**[Pyromancer's Gauntlet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Gauntlet)** – ***Magic** 2014*. Before we jump in *Theros* previews this weekend, we wanted to shine a spotlight on ***Magic** 2014*'s focus Planeswalker, Chandra Nalaar. The [M14 FAQ](/en/node/634626) states, "If damage is being dealt to multiple players and/or permanents at the same time, the damage being dealt to each one is increased by 2."



![Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Young+Pyromancer)
  
**[Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer)** – ***Magic** 2014*. Before we jump in *Theros* previews this weekend, we wanted to shine a spotlight on ***Magic** 2014*'s focus Planeswalker, Chandra Nalaar. What better way than with one of her biggest fans? A few weeks ago, Hall of Fame Elect [Luis Scott-Vargas](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Luis%20Scott-Vargas) 
[wrote about a deck](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/deck/1297) wherein [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) was a central element. What kinds of decks have you built with this Human Shaman? 
 


![Starke of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Starke+of+Rath)
  
**[Starke of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starke+of+Rath)** – *Tempest*. In his article "[Rosewater Rumble](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/rosewater-rumble-2013-03-11)," Mark Rosewater says, "*Tempest* shifted how we made [blocks]. It was the first set to really interconnect story with mechanics. It was the first set to start to tie together the different mechanical components synergistically. It was a big leap forward." [Read even more about this influential set](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/14)! 
 


![Sigil of the Empty Throne](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne)
  
**[Sigil of the Empty Throne](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne)** – *Planechase* (2012 Edition). Before Alara cracked apart into shards it was watched over by an archangel known as Asha, who ruled over the world's angels. And then came the Sundering, during which Asha sacrificed herself for the good of the plane. And although her throne remained empty after her departure, the angels who once obeyed her continued to protect the shard of Bant, even as Alara itself was reborn. 
 


![Dragon Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dragon+Egg)
  
**[Dragon Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Egg)** – ***Magic** 2014* . Hatching a creature from an egg has been a part of **Magic** since its first year, with the release of [Rukh Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=966) in *Arabian Nights*. Half of  [these six *egg*celent cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&name=+%5BEgg%5D&text=+!%5Bmana%5D+!%5BImprint%5D+!%5BDingus%5D&subtype=+!%5B%22Snake%22%5D)  are red, half have appeared in core sets, and half are uncommon, but only [Dragon Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Egg) meets all three of those criteria. *Egg*citing trivia for you! 
 


![Huntmaster of the Fells](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells)
  
**[Huntmaster of the Fells](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells)** – *Dark Ascension*. "Fells" is a fun word because it means a mountain or wild high place. Our Huntmaster here is standing on a slope, but "fell" *also* means the fleece or hide of an animal… including that of humans. Considering the Huntmaster can take down most Humans ([1083](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Human%22%5D&tough=+%3C%3d%5B2%5D&name=+!%5BTajic%5D)/[1488](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Human%22%5D) as of right now) when he transforms… well… it's probably a good guess he doesn't limit his hunting to canids. 
 


![Winter's Chill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Winter%27s+Chill)
  
**[Winter's Chill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter%27s+Chill)** – *Ice Age*. If you haven't been playing since *Coldsnap* you might not be aware of what a "snow land" is. It's, well, a land, with the snow type. There are [thirteen snow lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5B%22Snow%22%5D+%5B%22Land%22%5D) available: [Snow-Covered versions of the basic lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=+%5B%22Ice+Age%22%5D&type=+%5B%22Land%22%5D+%5B%22Snow%22%5D) introduced in *Ice Age* and [eight others](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=+%5B%22Coldsnap%22%5D&type=+%5B%22Land%22%5D+%5B%22Snow%22%5D+!%5B%22Basic%22%5D) introduced in *Coldsnap*, including the frighteningly fun [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths). 
 


![Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cruel+Ultimatum)
  
**[Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum)** – *Shards of Alara*. It would not do to present this card and not mention its most famous moment: the "called shot" from Hall of Famer Gabriel Nassif, [done on camera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju_LZGBN5qU&safe=active). It is also of note that [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum) is in *From the Vault: Twenty*, [along with nineteen other famous cards](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/259) from **Magic**'s history. 
 


![Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Supreme+Verdict)
  
**[Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict)** – *Return to Ravnica*. Leonos, aka Obez Murzeddi, aka previous guildmaster and last grand arbiter of the Azorius, is a human male of approximately seventy years. Fearing the corrupting influence of power that led to Augustin IV's crimes, he sought to put in power a longer-lived being as guildmaster. His efforts paid off when Isperia agreed to lead the guild as its supreme judge. 
 


![Stolen Identity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stolen+Identity)
  
**[Stolen Identity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stolen+Identity)** – *Gatecrash*. This great art is a little hard to see and fully appreciate at card size, so let's talk about what's going on! The art description includes, "Show a Boros knight kneeling within a magical symbol on the slick stone floor. The symbol is done in the Dimir style." The "Dimir style" includes a visual cue of "three sharp elements in a row," which you can see throughout the image, hinting at this clone's true allegiance. 
 


![Fade from Memory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fade+from+Memory)
  
**[Fade from Memory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fade+from+Memory)** – *Onslaught*. [Otaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otaria) (as mentioned in the flavor text) is a continent on the plane of Dominaria and the setting for both the *Odyssey* and *Onslaught* blocks. The memories of magic and power exist in the very land itself, and, as Doug Beyer [once wrote](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/54), "Some Planeswalkers report that it feels as if [Otaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otaria) itself yearns for its own past, aching to revisit times gone by." 
 


![79](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=79)
  
**[Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=79)** – *Limited Edition* Alpha. There are [thirty-four Assassins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Assassin%22%5D) in **Magic** and [twenty-two cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Bassassin%5D) (including three instants or sorceries) with "Assassin" in their name. Their effects vary a bit, but [Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin) was the first and set the flavor precedent of assassinating only tapped creatures, [which is seen on five cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&name=%7C%5Bassassin%5D&text=+%5Bdestroy%5D+%5Btapped%5D+%5Bcreature%5D). 
 


![3](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=3)
  
**[Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3)** – *Limited Edition* Alpha. For 20th Anniversary Week, we asked R&D for the most important cards in **Magic**'s history. What better way to end the week than with some [Power](/en/articles/archive/power-nine-2003-10-15-0)? James Sooy picked [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3), calling it "the icon of legendary cards among all card games." 
 


![23106](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=23106)
  
**[Kavu Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Titan)** – *Invasion*. For 20th Anniversary Week, we asked R&D for the most important cards in **Magic**'s history. Ken Nagle chose [Kavu Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Titan) and explained by saying, "[it] began a crusade to make green creatures stronger." It climaxed in *Odyssey* with [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla), [Call of the Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd), [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm), and [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) showcasing that, yes, it's possible for green to have the best creatures. 
 


![2478](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2478)
  
**[Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2478)** – *Ice Age*. For 20th Anniversary Week, we asked R&D for the most important cards in **Magic**'s history. James Sooy and Worth Wollpert both picked [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2478). James explained his choice by calling it "the original boogeyman of Constructed tournaments." 
 


![3644](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=3644)
  
**[Man-o'-War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3644)** – *Visions*. For 20th Anniversary Week, we asked R&D for the most important cards in **Magic**'s history. Ken Nagle and Shawn Main picked [Man-o'-War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3644). Ken said, "[Uktabi Orangutan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Orangutan), [Man-o'-War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3644), and friends showcased the 'enter the battlefield'-with-a-spell effect, creating powerful creatures for tournament play thanks to their warm bodies being relevant all the time, even if the [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) effect was not. **Magic** sets nowadays are full of 'enters the battlefield' abilities." 
 


![140233](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=140233)
  
**[Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=140233)** – *Lorwyn*. For 20th Anniversary Week, we asked R&D for the most important cards in **Magic**'s history. Worth Wollpert and Shawn Main picked the first Planeswalkers. Shawn explains, "[Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=140233) and the rest of the [*Lorwyn* 5](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=+%5B%22Lorwyn%22%5D&type=+%5B%22Planeswalker%22%5D)  represented a huge boon to the game. Planeswalkers had been central to the game's story from very early, but finally they had the opportunity to become part of the game." 
 


![Tenacious Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tenacious+Dead)
  
**[Tenacious Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tenacious+Dead)** – ***Magic** 2014*  Core Set. There are [37 Skeletons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Skeleton%22%5D) and [386 Warriors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Warrior%22%5D) in **Magic**. The first ([of five](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Warrior%22%5D+%5B%22Skeleton%22%5D)) Skeleton Warrior appeared in ***Magic** 2011* . After Warrior, the next-most-common Skeleton subtype is... [Bird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Skeleton%22%5D+%5B%22Bird%22%5D)! But there are just as many [legendary Skeletons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Skeleton%22%5D&type=+%5B%22Legendary%22%5D), which might be of interest to you if you play Commander! 
 


![50](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=50)
  
**[Black Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight)** – *Limited Edition* Alpha. Although the most famous modern black knight comes to us thanks to [Monty Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhRUe-gz690), the black knight as an [Arthurian trope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Knight_%28Arthurian_legend%29) has existed at least since the Middle Ages. There were also several historical figures who bore the moniker: [James Stewart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart,_the_Black_Knight_of_Lorn), [Zawisza Czarny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zawisza_Czarny), and the [Knight of Glin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_of_Glin). History is a little unclear on who had first strike or pro white, though.
