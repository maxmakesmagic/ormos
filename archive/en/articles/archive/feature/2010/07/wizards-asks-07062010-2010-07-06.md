*What's your favorite returning card in the [**Magic** 2011 Visual Spoiler](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/magic2011/spoiler) so far? What about your favorite new card?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** I've got to give props to [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) for its freaky art, [Goblin Balloon Brigade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Balloon+Brigade) for being hilarious, [Relentless Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relentless+Rats) for relentlessly coming back yet again, and [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) for being [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel), but ultimately, my favorite returning card has got to be [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling). I couldn't tell you how many times I've Flung some gigantic creature at somebody's face for the win, but it is not a small number.

As for new cards, that's tougher, partly because M11 is full of really exciting new cards and partly because I really love new cards. All of the Titans are awesome, particularly Primeval Titan (and Grave Titan for a Zombie deck). Augury Owl is a tempting choice given my vendetta against [Sage Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Owl). Leyline of Anticipation gives you an effect you want (flash for all your spells) exactly when you want it (before you cast any spells). Chandra's Outrage reads to me like a [Char](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Char) that puts the 2 damage where I want it. Then there's Garruk's Packleader, Ancient Hellkite, Temple Bell, Hoarding Dragon, Angelic [Grand Arbiter Augustin IV](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Grand%2BArbiter%2BAugustin%2BIV), Demon of Death's Gate ... Is it the Prerelease yet?

For reasons I can't quite explain, though, the card that has hit me hardest is Phylactery Lich, [masterfully previewed](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/97) last week by Doug Beyer.

I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the top-line fantasy concept. Maybe it's the idea of a *Phyrexia vs. the Coalition* style mono-black artifact deck. Maybe—okay, *probably*—it's the indestructible 5/5 for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif). Or maybe it's that tantalizing drawback that has me digging through my collection for [Darksteel Pendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Pendant)s.
