 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






With the excitement of *Khans of Tarkir* looming, and the swansong of *Magic 2015* Limited playing out this weekend, it'd be easy to forget another change happening on the horizon: *Return to Ravnica* and the other friends in its Block taking their leave from Standard.


With months to time to test, battle, and prove themselves, every player has a few favorite cards they'll miss as Standard takes its annual turn in a few weeks. This is what some of the game's best had to say.


**What are you going to miss most in Standard from Return to Ravnica block?**




**(9) Tom Martell, Pro Tour *Gatecrash* champion**

"[Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation). The card is extremely powerful. It's oppressive, but it oppresses decks I don't really enjoy playing. I like living in a world where [Pro Tour Hall of Fame player] Brian Kibler's decks don't work."


(17) Eric Froehlich, two-time Pro Tour Top 8 player

"I like the control cards. At the same time I'm happy to see them go but I was happy to play with four Azorius cards: [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere), [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm)."


**(21) Ben Friedman, rising Pro Tour star**

"The shock lands, like [Blood Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Crypt). Everything else had gotten reasonably stale, but the shock lands allowed a lot of flexibility. I think it would be fun to have a shock lands plus fetch lands manabase in Standard: Everybody could cast all these spells!"


**Nathan Holiday, winner Grand Prix San Diego 2013**

"[Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation). I like it as a pillar of the format. In Block, everything got so midrangey and Revelation goes over the top of everything. It's not just haymaker after haymaker; Revelation is the best."


**(23) Josh McClain, winner Grand Prix Detroit 2013**

"I am going to miss [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation). I never seem to do well with it but I always just keep coming back. It's always fun for me to play. It's probably better that it's gone so I'll stop playing with it."


**(12) Sam Black, two-time Pro Tour Top 8 player and winner national team Worlds 2008**

"[Cartel Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartel+Aristocrat). It's a card that lets you do cool things that nobody hates. Nobody is like 'Augh! [Cartel Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartel+Aristocrat)! No!'"
