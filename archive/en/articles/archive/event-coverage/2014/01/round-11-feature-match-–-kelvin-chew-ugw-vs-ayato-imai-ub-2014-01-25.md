Both players have clocked up two losses and are now battling to remain in contention for top 8.


The first game ended quickly as Ayato's crucial [Lash of the Whip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+of+the+Whip) Hopes were Stymied by Kelvin. This allowed [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) to gain indestructible and hexproof, and the Lion bestowed with [Nylea's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary) ended the game in short order. Ayato also took quite a bit of early damage as his only creature for the first five turns was [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin).

Ayato took the early lead in the second game with an air force that included [Insatiable Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insatiable+Harpy), [Blood-Toll Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Toll+Harpy) and [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin). At 12 life, [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) again came to Kelvin's rescue with the favour of [Nimbus Naiad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad).


After Kelvin summoned [Vulpine Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulpine+Goliath), Ayato made the lethal error of bestowing [Cavern Lampad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+Lampad) on [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin). Ayato was holding Lash of Whip in hand, but chose not to first deal with [Vulpine Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulpine+Goliath). Neither did he bestow the Lampad on lifelinking [Insatiable Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insatiable+Harpy) for fear of Kelvin having a removal spell.


This mistake cost Ayato dearly, for Kelvin was then able to bestow [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) on the Lion for his own 7/7 flying, lifelink, hexproof and indestructible creature and attack with Lion and Fox to turn the race in his favour with life totals at 15-6.

Ayato attempted to remedy his error by bestowing [Thassa's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Emissary) on [Insatiable Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insatiable+Harpy), but it was too little too late as Kelvin simply bestowed [Nylea's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary) on [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) to seal the game.


**Kelvin Chew wins 2-0 and remains in contention for top 8.**
