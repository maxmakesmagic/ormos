You know that the five [mana myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=_myr&fields=%7Cname&format=Mirrodin&color=All&output=summary&sort=power&first=4) from *Mirrodin* all have a distinctive artifact-race look.


You may not know that they were recently immortalized in three dimensions by 3-D artist [Henry Higgenbotham](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=Henry_G._Higgenbotham&fields=%7Cartist&format=Allsets&color=All&output=summary&sort=name&first=1) (visit his site at [www.henryh.com](http://www.henryh.com)). Here are some photos of the statues he created and showed off at [2004's World Championships](/en/events/coverage/nuijten-nassif-dominate-worlds) in San Francisco.

Maybe that's [plains4](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=plains4)! |
