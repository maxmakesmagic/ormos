Graveyard interactions! Discard! Madness! We must be talking about the *Odyssey* block, right? Wrong!


Below are some red and black cards from *Mirage* playtesting. Besides looking like they could have been in *Torment*, they're all quite wordy. Can you figure out what they ended up as in *Mirage*? Click each one to find out.


[Tombstone Stairwell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Tombstone%2BStairwell)  
[Hammer of Bogardan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Hammer%2Bof%2BBogardan)


 

[Delirium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Delirium)  
[Tainted Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Tainted%2BSpecter)


 

Notice that the Hammer had "If this is countered, remove it from the game." It's a good thing that line was removed from the game!
