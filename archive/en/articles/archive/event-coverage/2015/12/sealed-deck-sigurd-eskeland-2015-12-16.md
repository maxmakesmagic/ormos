"I had hoped to be able to play blue, black and red, those are the three best colours of Invasion. And I had hoped to avoid to play green," Sigurd Eskeland says. That was his strategy before coming to Grand Prix Helsinki. However, Sigurd got to experience that Sealed Decks can be really hard to make.



The gentle giant and 2000 Pro Tour New York Champion opened a very varied card pool. He had a few good cards in every colour, but no one really strong colour. One of the most powerful cards was the white, blue and green dragon, Treva, the Renewer. However, all his removal cards were in red and black, he had two Plague Spores, a Tribal Flames, a Zap and an Exotic Curse. So Sigurd had to figure out how to best make his deck.



These are the cards Sigurd opened:

1 Dream Thrush  

1 Faerie Squadron

"So my deck has five colours," Sigurd sighs. "It was impossible to make a three coloured deck that was good enough - I wouldn't have had a chance at all. The good cards were divided among all the colours, and even making a five coloured deck was really hard."



This is the deck Sigurd registered:



7 Forest  

3 Island  

2 Mountain  

2 Plains  

2 Swamp  

1 Ancient Spring  

1 Llanowar Knight  

1 Ordered Migration  

2 Plague Spores  

1 Recoil  

1 Samite Archer  

1 Treva, the Renewer  

1 Benalish Emissary  

1 Glimmering Angel  

1 Faerie Squadron  

2 Probe  

1 Exotic Curse  

1 Halam Djinn  

1 Tribal Flames  

1 Zap  

1 Fertile Ground  

1 Harrow  

1 Kavu Climber  

1 Pincer Spider  

1 Quirion Trailblazer  

1 Rooting Kavu  

1 Serpentine Kavu  


"I didn't have enough depth in any of the colours to go three coloured. So I just lay all the good cards on the table and picked cards until I reached 23. Then I made the mana base," Sigurd explains. A Harrow, a Fertile Ground and a Quirion Trailblazer would help him to get to the correct lands, and with a couple of green fatties he got a reasonable green base colour.



"I made a small mistake, I am playing too many white cards," Sigurd admits. With seven cards with white mana in its casting cost, two plains only may be a bit too few to get to them consistently. But Sigurd chose to play seven forests as they are really important to get his deck going at all. "I need to draw green mana, and if I don't have a forest in my opening hand, I will mulligan. So I should have taken out more of the white. But I can fix that after sideboarding."



Sigurd knows his deck is far from optimal, but he hopes to go 2-2 and make the second day. "I'm hoping to get lucky. At least it will be fun to play. The deck is good if I can get the mana, but I won't get that in every game, it's as simple as that."
