R*ise of the Eldrazi* Game Day is on May 22 and 23. Worldwide! And why should you go? Because playing **Magic** is fun, that's why!


Game Days are Standard Constructed format. The use of deck lists is recommended. The tournament will be Swiss-style, with the number of rounds determined by attendance. And they're the first opportunity to play Standard format on a global scale with the cards from *Rise of the Eldrazi*!


But in the unlikely event that a fun Standard tournament isn't enough to entice you out to your local **Magic** store, we've also got promo cards. While supplies last, all participants will get this handsome [Staggershock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock)!

The Top 8 players each receive an exclusive [Deathless Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathless+Angel) full-art promo card. The cards are awarded to the top eight players even if the tournament cuts only to the Top 4. Two [Deathless Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathless+Angel) promo cards will also be awarded as door prizes at each location.
