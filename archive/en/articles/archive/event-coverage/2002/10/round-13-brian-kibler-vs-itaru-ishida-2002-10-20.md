Two famed players from different continents crossed swords in the new Standard environment this round. Brian Kibler, noted deckbuilder, Dragon-lover and shameless self-promoter had managed to pull himself from 3-3 to a three-way tie for fifth at 7-5. Considering the Top 4 all have 8-4, he's in good shape to make a run at the title. He's doing it in style, too, bringing an updated [Mirari's Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake) deck that's set to crush the competition.

*(click to open full-size in a new window)*He's a real contrast to the reserved Ishida, but even he has come alive in the spirit of the Invitational. Ishida's working against type today, running a straight-up red-green beatdown, instead of one of the crazier concoctions for which the Japanese are famous. It stands a poor matchup against Kibler's Wake.


Ishida started out right, with [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd), but Kibler still had all of twelve life by the time he was able to Speculate for three [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace)s.


A [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)bolt used twice put him to eight. He tapped all but two lands for [Mirari's Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake). The mana burn from his next fog put him to seven. Ishida was holding a pair of [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption)s. Kibler hadn't a care in the world. [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) got him [Time Stretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Stretch), and he got ready to take two more turns.


They were good ones. The first saw him develop his mana with a second Wake and a pair of cycled [Krosan Tusker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker)s. The last of it he spent [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish)ing for his kill Card, [Firecat Blitz](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firecat+Blitz), and playing out [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). As if it mattered.


Sure enough, he untapped, dropped an unnecessary fourth Wake, and Blitzed Ishida with twenty-seven, count 'em, twenty-seven 4/4 cat tokens. Meow, indeed!


Kibler 1 - Ishida 0


Ishida got a really busty start in the second game, leading with [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), then [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) and [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). Kibler Speculated for [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace), but without green mana he would have to wait a turn for his Verge to come online. Those two turns let Ishida take him from twenty to six, courtesy a madnessed Rootwalla.


Kibler skipped the [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) plan and went straight to [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). Ishida forgot to activate his [Wooded Foothills](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Foothills), giving Kibler two life he sorely needed. [Volcanic Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer) brought Kibler to three, and now things were really dicey.

*(click to open full-size in a new window)*Kibler waited on [Memory Lapse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse) and [Krosan Tusker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker), eager to dig to some action. Ishida played a fourth land and passed it back. Kibler thought hard. He decided that if Ishida had [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption), [Memory Lapse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse) wouldn't be enough, so he cycled both Tuskers, tapping out. Ishida had nothing.


He started work. [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) and [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) got him cards ahead. Ishida [Reclaim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclaim)ed all of Kibler's [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)s at end of turn, then when Kibler tapped out to [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion), he [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize)d [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). Of course, he wasn't drawing burn, just more [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize)s. Kibler hit himself with [Time Stretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Stretch). Another [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) was waiting for him. Finally, Tusker got him [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) to serve up [Gerrard's Wisdom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard%27s+Wisdom), putting him safely out of the danger zone. [Mirari's Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake) powered up [Crush of Wurms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crush+of+Wurms), and then things were really over. A second [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) for [Time Stretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Stretch) finished things off.


**Final Result:** Brian Kibler defeats Itaru Ishida 2-0
