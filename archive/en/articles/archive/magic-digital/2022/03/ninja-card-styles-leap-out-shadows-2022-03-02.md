The streets of Towashi are glowing and vibrant, but bright lights can cast long shadows. Be on your guard, because a swift strike could come from around any corner. And even if you see one coming, there's no telling how many more are waiting behind them, ready to emerge out of the shadows. But they've made one mistake: assuming that*they*are the hunters and *you* are the prey. Now it's your turn to turn the tables and show them who's really in control.
