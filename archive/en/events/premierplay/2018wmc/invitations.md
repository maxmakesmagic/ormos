2018 World Magic Cup Invitation List
------------------------------------


Each national team invited to the 2018 World *Magic* Cup will consist of the following players:


* The finalists\* of the 2018 Nationals run in that country.
* The top ranked player at the conclusion of the 2017-2018 Professional Points Season from that country that is not already invited based on the above criteria. If two or more players are tied, ties will be broken as follows:


	+ The tied player with the greatest number of Pro Tour Top 8\* finishes during the 2017-18 Professional Points Season, or
	+ The tied player with the greatest number of Grand Prix Top 8 finishes during the 2017-18 Professional Points Season, or

	+ The tied player with the highest Planeswalker Point total at the conclusion of the 2018 Seasonal Yearly Award Season.

\*In the event a finalist in the 2018 Nationals run in a country is also the team captain for that country, the invitation will pass down to the person who placed third at that country's Nationals.
