**Upcoming Standard PTQ on Sunday, May 1**


Attention all Pro Tour hopefuls, a Pro Tour Qualifier (PTQ) is approaching! The Standard Pro Tour Qualifier Preliminaries begin Thursday, April 28, and run through Sunday, May 1. We hope to see you in the PTQ Finals on Sunday, May 1!


Remember, you are no longer required to enter into the PTQ Finals immediately following the Preliminary that you qualified through thanks to the redesigned PTQ system that Lee Sharpe announced [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-qualifier-changes-2015-11-16).

**Reminder: Place Redemption Orders Before May 4**


In an effort to make sure *Magic Online* is available when you want to play *Magic*, we’re working on ways to reduce the number of times we have to bring the system offline for maintenance. As a first step we’re simply going to eliminate at least one downtime each month.


Here are the dates of the exact downtimes we’ll be skipping in the first half of 2016:


* May 11
* June 8
* June 22

During these weeks without a downtime *Magic Online* will NOT be processing set redemptions. This means that if you're thinking about redemption, please submit your order before the May 4 downtime if you want your order processed before May 11. If your order isn't made prior to May 4, it won't be processed until May 18.
