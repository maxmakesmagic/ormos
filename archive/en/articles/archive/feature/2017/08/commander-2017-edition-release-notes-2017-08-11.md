The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://www.wizards.com/CustomerService).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

GENERAL NOTES
=============


**Release Information**


The *Magic: The Gathering—Commander (2017 Edition)* release consists of four different game packs. Each game pack contains a deck with 100 cards plus an oversized foil commander card. The four decks are "Arcane Wizardry," "Draconic Domination," "Feline Ferocity," and "Vampiric Bloodlust."


Release date: August 25, 2017


Go to [Wizards.com/Locator](http://www.wizards.com/locator) to find an event or store near you.




---

**New Cards and Format Legality**


There are 56 cards within the *Magic: The Gathering—Commander (2017 Edition)* decks that are completely new to the *Magic* game. These cards are legal for play in the Commander, Vintage, and Legacy formats. They aren't legal for play in the Standard or Modern formats.


The other cards in this release are legal for play in any format that already allows those cards. That is, appearing in this release doesn't change a card's legality in any format.


For more information about *Magic* formats, please visit [Magic.Wizards.com/Rules](http://magic.wizards.com/rules). For information about the format legality of a specific card, please visit [Gatherer.Wizards.com](http://gatherer.wizards.com/), search for the card, and check the "Sets & Legality" tab.




---

**What Is Commander?**


Created and popularized by fans, Commander is a casual format in which each player's deck is led by the legendary creature of his or her choice—the player's *commander*. It's usually played in casual free-for-all multiplayer games, although two-player games are also popular. Each player starts at 40 life. Each deck contains exactly 100 cards, including its commander*.* Commander is also a "singleton" format: other than basic lands, each card must have a different English name.


A recommended banned list for the Commander format is maintained by the rules committee at [MTGCommander.net](http://mtgcommander.net/), not by Wizards of the Coast.




---

**Using Your Commander**


The legendary creature card chosen as your deck's commander plays a prominent role in games, often appearing on the battlefield multiple times.


* Your commander begins the game in a separate game area called the *command zone*. The other 99 cards are shuffled and become your library.
* While in the command zone, your commander's abilities won't affect the game unless those abilities specifically say they do.
* You may cast your commander from the command zone. Each time you do, it costs 2 more to cast for each time you've previously cast it from the command zone during the game.
* If your commander would be exiled or put into your hand, graveyard, or library from anywhere, you may choose to put it into the command zone instead.

Your commander's *color identity* determines the other cards that can be in your deck. A card's color identity includes its color, as defined by its mana cost or color indicator, and the colors of any colored mana symbols in the rules text.


* Color identity is established before the game begins and doesn't change during the game, even if your commander becomes a different color.
* A land with a basic land type can't be included in your deck if that basic land type's intrinsic mana ability generates a color of mana outside of your color identity.

In addition to the normal rules regarding winning and losing the game, the Commander format has one other rule: a player who has been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over the course of the game loses the game.


* Players should keep track of combat damage dealt to them by each commander over the course of the game.
* This rule includes a player's own commander, which can deal combat damage to its owner if the commander is controlled by another player or if its combat damage gets redirected to that player.



---

**Leaving the Game**


Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after a player loses and leaves the game.


* When a player leaves the game, all permanents, spells, and other cards owned by that player also leave the game.
* If that player controlled any abilities or copies of spells that were waiting to resolve, they cease to exist.
* If that player controlled any permanents owned by another player, the effects that gave control of them to the player who left end. If this doesn't give control of them to a different player (perhaps because they entered the battlefield under the control of the player who left), they're exiled.



---

**Oversized Commanders**


Each *Magic: The Gathering—Commander (2017 Edition)* deck comes with an oversized foil card that corresponds to one possible commander of that deck. This card is for fun only and isn't required for Commander gameplay.


* You must have the traditional *Magic* card version of your commander, even if you use the oversized card.
* As long as your commander is in a public zone, such as the command zone or the battlefield, you may substitute the oversized card for the traditional *Magic* card.
* If your commander is in a hidden zone, such as your library or your hand, use the traditional *Magic* card.



---

**New Ability Word: Eminence**


Some legends are sufficiently adept at managing your forces that they can do it with aplomb even while relaxing in the command zone. These creatures each have one ability with the eminence ability word. An ability word appears in italics and has no rules meaning.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_41iZZBXhco.png)


Edgar Markov  

3RWB  

Legendary Creature — Vampire Knight  

4/4  
*Eminence* — Whenever you cast another Vampire spell, if Edgar Markov is in the command zone or on the battlefield, create a 1/1 black Vampire creature token.  

First strike, haste  

Whenever Edgar Markov attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on each Vampire you control.


* Three eminence abilities are triggered abilities. That creature must be on the battlefield or in the command zone as the trigger event occurs and also as the triggered ability resolves. If the creature is in an appropriate zone as the trigger event occurs but leaves that zone, the ability won't do anything as it resolves.
* Notably, if your commander is on the battlefield and its eminence ability triggers, but it's put into the command zone before that ability resolves, that ability won't do anything as it resolves. This is because an object that changes zones is considered a new object.



---

**Cycle: Cursed to Be Attacked**


It's great when you can convince the other players to gang up on one player you want to take down. If you're having trouble convincing players to do your work with words alone, we've got a cycle of Curses to help encourage them.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_KSenKoRxe0.png)


Curse of Verbosity  

2U  

Enchantment — Aura Curse  

Enchant player  

Whenever enchanted player is attacked, you draw a card. Each opponent attacking that player does the same.


* Each Curse's ability triggers only once, no matter how many creatures are attacking the enchanted player.
* A player is attacking another player if he or she controls a creature that's attacking that player. If no creatures are attacking the enchanted player as a Curse's ability resolves (most likely because they've left the battlefield), only the Curse's controller performs its actions.
* The triggered ability of these Curses won't trigger if only a planeswalker controlled by the enchanted player is attacked.
* If you enchant yourself with one of these Curses, you'll get its effects whenever another player attacks you.



---

**Theme: Choose a Creature Type**


Many players enjoy building decks that focus on a single "tribe." Seven cards in this set reward you for giving your creatures lots of friends, affecting every creature you control with a type of your choice—or harming every other creature.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_ARyIIypGqj.png)


Kindred Dominance  

5BB  

Sorcery  

Choose a creature type. Destroy all creatures that aren't of the chosen type.


* You must choose an existing creature type, such as Vampire or Cat. Card types such as "artifact" can't be chosen.
* You can't choose multiple creature types, such as "Cat Warrior." A Cat Warrior is both a Cat and a Warrior. It's affected by anything that affects either type and unaffected by things that affect non-Cat or non-Warrior creatures.



---

**CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_IKDxkLb9OG.png)


Alms Collector  

3W  

Creature — Cat Cleric  

3/4  

Flash  

If an opponent would draw two or more cards, instead you and that player each draw a card.


* Alms Collector's replacement effect applies to an instruction to draw more than one card before any replacement effects apply to individual cards drawn. For example, if you have a card with dredge in your graveyard, you can't dredge it before the effect of Divination is modified by Alms Collector's replacement effect.
* Once a replacement effect has been applied to an event, it can't be applied again to the resulting events. For example, once Alms Collector's replacement effect has modified the effect of a player's Divination, Thought Reflection can double that player's resulting card draw without Alms Collector's replacement effect applying again.
* To determine whether a player is instructed to draw multiple once or instructed multiple times to draw one card, count how many times the word "draw" is used. Alms Collector's replacement effect watches for one "draw" that instructs a player to draw multiple cards (including instructions to "draw a card for each. . .").
* If an effect puts cards into a player's hand without using the word "draw" at all, Alms Collector's replacement effect doesn't apply.
* If two players each control an Alms Collector and an effect instructs them to each draw two or more cards, the replacement effect of each Alms Collector is applied and both players end up drawing two cards.
* If two players each control an Alms Collector and a third player would draw two or more cards, the third player chooses which Alms Collector's replacement effect will apply, and therefore which of the first two players draws a card.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_kqVPwMnL5C.png)


Arahbo, Roar of the World  

3GW  

Legendary Creature — Cat Avatar  

5/5  
*Eminence* — At the beginning of combat on your turn, if Arahbo, Roar of the World is in the command zone or on the battlefield, another target Cat you control gets +3/+3 until end of turn.  

Whenever another Cat you control attacks, you may pay 1GW. If you do, it gains trample and gets +X/+X until end of turn, where X is its power.


* Once either of Arahbo's triggered abilities has resolved, the affected Cat keeps its bonus even if Arahbo changes zones later in the turn.
* The value of X is determined only as Arahbo's last ability resolves. If the attacking Cat's power is negative at that time, X is 0.
* If multiple Cats attack, Arahbo's last ability triggers that many times. You may pay 1GW each time one resolves.
* While resolving Arahbo's last ability, you can't pay 1GW multiple times to multiply the effect for one Cat.
* If a Cat you control enters the battlefield attacking, it won't cause Arahbo's last ability to trigger.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_YajfVeBAlv.png)


Balan, Wandering Knight  

2WW  

Legendary Creature — Cat Knight  

3/3  

First strike  

Balan, Wandering Knight has double strike as long as two or more Equipment are attached to it.  

1W: Attach all Equipment you control to Balan.


* Balan's activated ability has no timing restriction. You can activate it any time you have priority.
* If Balan deals first-strike damage and then gains double strike (most likely because it picked up some Equipment with its activated ability after first-strike damage was dealt), it will also deal regular combat damage.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_YL4XrTUTIH.png)


Bloodforged Battle-Axe  

1  

Artifact — Equipment  

Equipped creature gets +2/+0.  

Whenever equipped creature deals combat damage to a player, create a token that's a copy of Bloodforged Battle-Axe.  

Equip 2


* The token enters the battlefield unattached.
* The token has all three of Bloodforged Battle-Axe's abilities, including the one that creates more tokens.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_ZAA9C3LVIy.png)


Boneyard Scourge  

2BB  

Creature — Zombie Dragon  

4/3  

Flying  

Whenever a Dragon you control dies while Boneyard Scourge is in your graveyard, you may pay 1B. If you do, return Boneyard Scourge from your graveyard to the battlefield.


* If Boneyard Scourge dies at the same time as another Dragon you control, its ability won't trigger.
* If Boneyard Scourge leaves your graveyard before its triggered ability resolves, it won't be returned to the battlefield.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_T8yzxPjmKz.png)


Crimson Honor Guard  

3RR  

Creature — Vampire Knight  

4/5  

Trample  

At the beginning of each player's end step, Crimson Honor Guard deals 4 damage to that player unless he or she controls a commander.


* Crimson Honor Guard's last ability triggers at the beginning of each player's end step whether that player controls a commander or not. Whether that player controls a commander is checked only as the ability resolves.
* Crimson Honor Guard will deal 4 damage to you, too, if you don't control a commander.
* The player could control any player's commander to satisfy Crimson Honor Guard's ability. If a player gains control of another player's commander "until end of turn," the player who gained control of it will still control that commander during the end step.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_dHoqKl8Nuw.png)


Curse of Bounty  

1G  

Enchantment — Aura Curse  

Enchant player  

Whenever enchanted player is attacked, untap all nonland permanents you control. Each opponent attacking that player untaps all nonland permanents he or she controls.


* Untapping an attacking creature doesn't remove it from combat.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_lkPgKvZSim.png)


Curse of Opulence  

R  

Enchantment — Aura Curse  

Enchant player  

Whenever enchanted player is attacked, create a colorless artifact token named Gold. It has "Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool." Each opponent attacking that player does the same.


* Curse of Opulence's triggered ability resolves after attackers have been declared. Any costs to attack must have already been paid before the attacking player creates the Gold.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_n003gdpuEs.png)


Disrupt Decorum  

2RR  

Sorcery  

Goad all creatures you don't control. *(Until your next turn, those creatures attack each combat if able and attack a player other than you if able.)*


* Creatures that enter the battlefield after Disrupt Decorum resolves won't be goaded.
* During a player's declare attackers step, if a creature that player controls that's been goaded is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under that player's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack.
* If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
* If the creature doesn't meet any of the above exceptions and can attack, it must attack a player other than the controller of the spell or ability that goaded it if able. It the creature can't attack any of those players but could otherwise attack, it must attack an opposing planeswalker (controlled by any opponent) or the player who goaded it.
* Attacking with a goaded creature doesn't cause it to stop being goaded. If there is an additional combat phase that turn, or if another player gains control of that creature before it stops being goaded, it must attack again if able.
* If a creature you control has been goaded by multiple opponents, it must attack one of your opponents who hasn't goaded it, as that fulfills the maximum number of goad requirements. If a creature you control has been goaded by each of your opponents, you choose which opponent it attacks.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_41iZZBXhco.png)


Edgar Markov  

3RWB  

Legendary Creature — Vampire Knight  

4/4  
*Eminence* — Whenever you cast another Vampire spell, if Edgar Markov is in the command zone or on the battlefield, create a 1/1 black Vampire creature token.  

First strike, haste  

Whenever Edgar Markov attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on each Vampire you control.


* Edgar Markov's last ability puts a +1/+1 counter on each Vampire you control, including itself and Vampires you control that aren't attacking.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_7JMF4EeSr7.png)


Fortunate Few  

3WW  

Sorcery  

Choose a nonland permanent you don't control, then each other player chooses a nonland permanent he or she doesn't control that hasn't been chosen this way. Destroy all other nonland permanents.


* After you choose a nonland permanent, each other player does so in turn order starting from the player whose turn it is. Each player will know the choice made by previous players.
* Once Fortunate Few begins resolving, no player may take any actions other than those specified by Fortunate Few until it's done resolving. Notably, players must act to protect their permanents (such as by activating Kindred Boon) before knowing which permanents will be chosen.
* A permanent with indestructible can be chosen this way even though it wouldn't be destroyed otherwise.
* Lands can't be chosen and won't be destroyed, even if they have other types (such as an artifact land).



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_r01zzwKbZZ.png)


Fractured Identity  

3WU  

Sorcery  

Exile target nonland permanent. Each player other than its controller creates a token that's a copy of it.


* The tokens copy exactly what was printed on the permanent and nothing else (unless that permanent was copying something else or was a token; see below). They don't copy whether that permanent was tapped or untapped, whether it had any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If the copied permanent had X in its mana cost, X is 0.
* If the copied permanent was copying something else, the tokens enter the battlefield as whatever that permanent was copying.
* If the copied permanent is a token, the tokens created by Fractured Identity copy the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when the tokens enter the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied permanent will also work.
* If the exiled permanent was a commander, the tokens won't be commanders.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_Ic058vbSh1.png)


Galecaster Colossus  

5UU  

Creature — Giant Wizard  

5/6  

Tap an untapped Wizard you control: Return target nonland permanent you don't control to its owner's hand.


* To activate Galecaster Colossus's ability, you may tap any untapped Wizard you control, including one you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn, such as itself. (Note that tapping the creature doesn't use T [the tap symbol].)



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_WHUVa6kNF8.png)


Hammer of Nazahn  

4  

Legendary Artifact — Equipment  

Whenever Hammer of Nazahn or another Equipment enters the battlefield under your control, you may attach that Equipment to target creature you control.  

Equipped creature gets +2/+0 and has indestructible.  

Equip 4


* If Hammer of Nazahn enters the battlefield at the same time as other Equipment you control, its ability will trigger for each of those Equipment.
* If a creature has been dealt damage, that damage remains marked on it until the cleanup step. If the equipped creature has been dealt lethal damage, and later in the turn Hammer of Nazahn becomes unattached from that creature, that creature will be destroyed.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_qswjWjxbPq.png)


Heirloom Blade  

3  

Artifact — Equipment  

Equipped creature gets +3/+1.  

Whenever equipped creature dies, you may reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a creature card that shares a creature type with it. Put that card into your hand and the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.  

Equip 1


* If you don't reveal a creature card that shares a type with the creature that died, you'll just reveal and randomize your library.
* If the equipped creature has no creature type, no card can share a creature type with it.  

 You'll reveal cards until you find one that shares at least one creature type with the creature that died. For example, if a Cat Wizard dies, you'll stop if you reveal a Human Wizard or Cat Soldier.
* Compare the revealed cards to the creature as it last existed before it died, not to the creature card as it exists in its owner's graveyard, to determine which one you put into your hand.
* "Artifact" isn't a creature type.
* If Heirloom Blade leaves the battlefield at the same time that the equipped creature dies, its triggered ability triggers.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_T4OQvG1nhA.png)


Herald's Horn  

3  

Artifact  

As Herald's Horn enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.  

Creature spells you cast of the chosen type cost 1 less to cast.  

At the beginning of your upkeep, look at the top card of your library. If it's a creature card of the chosen type, you may reveal it and put it into your hand.


* The effect of Herald's Horn reduces only generic mana in a spell's cost. If that cost has no generic mana, the cost isn't reduced.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* If you don't put the top card of your library into your hand, you put it back on top of your library without revealing it. You'll draw it in that turn's draw step.
* If you somehow control a Herald's Horn with no chosen creature type, no spells will cost less to cast, not even creature spells with no creature type. You'll be able to look at the top card of your library at the beginning of each upkeep, but you can never put it into your hand this way, even if it's a creature card with no creature type.

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/c17/en_aiW6ELJi4z.png)


Hungry Lynx  

1G  

Creature — Cat  

2/2  

Cats you control have protection from Rats. *(They can't be blocked, targeted, or dealt damage by Rats.)*  

At the beginning of your end step, target opponent creates a 1/1 black Rat creature token with deathtouch.  

Whenever a Rat dies, put a +1/+1 counter on each Cat you control.


* If a permanent has protection from Rats, it means four things:
	1. Damage from a source that's a Rat that would be dealt to that permanent is prevented.
	2. Auras and Equipment that are somehow Rats can't be attached to that permanent.
	3. Rats can't block that permanent.
	4. That permanent can't be the target of abilities of Rats or spells that are somehow Rats.
* Nothing other than the specified events is prevented or illegal. Hungry Lynx can't block a Rat with the ability "This creature can't be blocked," for example.
* The opponent who creates the Rat token is the owner of that token.
* Tokens that are sacrificed or destroyed are put into their owner's graveyard before ceasing to exist. If the token was a Rat, Hungry Lynx's last ability will trigger.
* Hungry Lynx's last ability puts a +1/+1 counter on each Cat you control, including itself.
* If Hungry Lynx dies at the same time as a Rat, its ability triggers, but Hungry Lynx won't be on the battlefield as that ability resolves. It can't be saved by the +1/+1 counter that would have been put on it. The same is true of any other Cats you control that die at the same time. Your remaining Cats will each get a +1/+1 counter.

Inalla, Archmage Ritualist  

2UBR  

Legendary Creature — Human Wizard  

4/5  
*Eminence* — Whenever another nontoken Wizard enters the battlefield under your control, if Inalla, Archmage Ritualist is in the command zone or on the battlefield, you may pay 1. If you do, create a token that's a copy of that Wizard. The token gains haste. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step.  

Tap five untapped Wizards you control: Target player loses 7 life.


* You can pay 1 only once each time Inalla's first ability resolves. You can't pay more to get more than one token.
* If Inalla enters the battlefield at the same time as other Wizards you control, its ability will trigger for each of those other Wizards.
* The token copies exactly what was printed on the creature and nothing else (unless that creature was copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature was tapped or untapped, whether it had any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If the copied creature had X in its mana cost, X is 0.
* If the copied creature was copying something else, the token enters the battlefield as whatever that permanent was copying.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
* If the creature that caused Inalla's ability to trigger has already left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, you can still pay 1. If you do, you'll create a token with the copiable values of the characteristics of that creature as it last existed on the battlefield.
* If a copied creature is legendary, any triggered abilities it has will trigger if appropriate before the "legend rule" causes one of those legendary creatures to be put into its owner's graveyard. Those abilities will be put on the stack after the "legend rule" is applied.
* To activate Inalla's last ability, you may tap any untapped Wizards you control, including ones you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn, such as Inalla itself. (Note that tapping the creature doesn't use T [the tap symbol].)

Izzet Chemister  

2R  

Creature — Goblin Wizard  

1/3  

Haste  

R, T: Exile target instant or sorcery card from your graveyard.  

1R, T, Sacrifice Izzet Chemister: Cast any number of cards exiled with Izzet Chemister without paying their mana costs.


* The last ability of Izzet Chemister only lets you cast cards exiled by that card. If Izzet Chemister leaves the battlefield before you activate that ability, the exiled cards are lost forever.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, those must be paid to cast the card.
* If the card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
* You must cast any of the exiled cards you wish to cast while Izzet Chemister's last ability is resolving. You can't cast them later in the turn. You can cast a sorcery this way at a time you normally wouldn't be able to.
* You cast the exiled cards one at a time in any order. Later spells can target ones you cast earlier. None of the spells resolve until after you're done casting them all.
* Any of the cards you don't cast will remain in exile.

Kess, Dissident Mage  

1UBR  

Legendary Creature — Human Wizard  

3/4  

Flying  

During each of your turns, you may cast an instant or sorcery card from your graveyard. If a card cast this way would be put into your graveyard this turn, exile it instead.


* You must follow the normal timing permissions and restrictions of the card you cast from your graveyard.
* You must pay the costs to cast that card. If it has an alternative cost, you may cast it for that cost instead.
* Once you begin to cast the card, losing control of Kess won't affect the spell. You can finish casting it as normal and it will be exiled if it would be put into your graveyard this turn.
* If you cast a card from your graveyard using another effect, such as that of flashback, Kess's effect doesn't apply. You can cast another instant or sorcery card from your graveyard.
* If you cast one instant or sorcery card from your graveyard and then have a new Kess come under your control in the same turn, you may cast another instant or sorcery card from your graveyard that turn.
* If a sorcery card is put into your graveyard during your main phase and the stack is empty, you have a chance to cast it before any player may attempt to remove that card from your graveyard.
* If a spell cast this way is put into another zone after it resolves (perhaps because it had buyback), it's considered a new object. If that card later moves to your graveyard, it won't be exiled.

Whenever Kheru Mind-Eater deals combat damage to a player, that player exiles a card from his or her hand face down.  

You may look at and play cards exiled with Kheru Mind-Eater.


* If another player gains control of Kheru Mind-Eater, that player can see all of the exiled cards and may play them. Once a player looks at a face-down exiled card, that player may look at that card any time later in the game.
* The last ability of Kheru Mind-Eater only lets you cast cards exiled by that card. If Kheru Mind-Eater leaves the battlefield, the exiled cards are lost forever.
* You may play land cards exiled with Kheru Mind-Eater only if you have an available land play this turn.
* You must pay the costs to cast the exiled cards. If one has an alternative cost, you may cast it for that cost instead.
* Once you begin to cast an exiled card, losing control of Kheru Mind-Eater won't affect the spell.

As Kindred Boon enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.  

1W: Put a divinity counter on target creature you control of the chosen type.  

Each creature you control with a divinity counter on it has indestructible.


* If a creature that isn't of the chosen type somehow gets a divinity counter on it, that creature will have indestructible.
* If a creature has been dealt damage, that damage remains marked on it until the cleanup step. If a creature with a divinity counter on it has been dealt lethal damage, and later in the turn Kindred Boon leaves the battlefield or the counters are removed from that creature, that creature will be destroyed.
* If you somehow control a Kindred Boon with no chosen creature type, its activated ability can't be activated.

Kindred Charge  

4RR  

Sorcery  

Choose a creature type. For each creature you control of the chosen type, create a token that's a copy of that creature. Those tokens gain haste. Exile them at the beginning of the next end step.


* The tokens copy exactly what was printed on the creatures and nothing else (unless one of those creatures was copying something else or was a token; see below). They don't copy whether that creature was tapped or untapped, whether it had any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If a copied creature had X in its mana cost, X is 0.
* If a copied creature was copying something else, the tokens enter the battlefield as whatever that creature was copying.
* If a copied creature is a token, the token created by Kindred Charge copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creatures will trigger when the tokens enter the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
* All of the tokens enter the battlefield at the same time. Any triggered abilities they have will see each other entering the battlefield.
* If a copied creature is legendary, any triggered abilities it has will trigger if appropriate before the "legend rule" causes one of those legendary creatures to be put into its owner's graveyard. Those abilities will be put on the stack after the "legend rule" is applied.

Licia, Sanguine Tribune  

5RWB  

Legendary Creature — Vampire Soldier  

4/4  

Licia, Sanguine Tribune costs 1 less to cast for each 1 life you gained this turn.  

First strike, lifelink  

Pay 5 life: Put three +1/+1 counters on Licia. Activate this ability only during your turn and only once each turn.


* Licia's first ability reduces only generic mana in its cost. It can't reduce the cost below RWB.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases (such as the "commander tax"), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* Licia's first ability checks how much life you've gained during the turn, not what your life total is compared to what it was when the turn began. For example, if you start the turn at 30 life, gain 6 life during the turn, then lose 10 life later that turn, Licia still costs 6 less to cast.
* If Licia's last ability is countered, it can't be activated again in the same turn.

* You may play a land exiled this way only if you have an available land play this turn.
* You must follow the normal timing permissions and restrictions for cards you cast this way.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, those must be paid to cast the card.
* If the card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
* Any of the cards you don't play will remain in exile.

Mairsil, the Pretender  

1UBR  

Legendary Creature — Human Wizard  

4/4  

When Mairsil, the Pretender enters the battlefield, you may exile an artifact or creature card from your hand or graveyard and put a cage counter on it.  

Mairsil, the Pretender has all activated abilities of all cards you own in exile with cage counters on them. You may activate each of those abilities only once each turn.


* The exiled cards remain exiled with cage counters when Mairsil leaves the battlefield. If Mairsil returns to the battlefield, it will see all of those exiled cards with cage counters on them.
* If another player gains control of Mairsil, it will have the abilities of only cards that player owns in exile with cage counters on them.
* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as equip) are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. Mairsil won't gain triggered abilities (which start with "when," "whenever," or "at").
* If an activated ability of a card in exile with a cage counter on it references the card it's printed on by name, treat Mairsil's instance of that ability as though it referenced Mairsil by name instead. For instance, if Mairsil exiles Magus of the Mind, the cost to activate the ability includes sacrificing Mairsil, not sacrificing Magus of the Mind.
* If one of Mairsil's abilities is countered, most likely because its target became illegal before it resolved, it can't be activated again in the same turn.
* If multiple cards exiled with cage counters on them have the same ability, Mairsil will have multiple instances of that ability. Each may be activated once each turn.
* If you have a creature enter the battlefield as a copy of Mairsil, its first ability triggers. You won't be able to activate any abilities before the "legend rule" applies, but the triggered ability will still let you exile another card with a cage counter regardless of which Mairsil you keep.
* If Mairsil gains an activated ability that's normally linked to a non-activated ability of the card it came from, the ability Mairsil has isn't linked to any ability. For example, if Mairsil exiles Prototype Portal, the activated ability creates no tokens at all; it doesn't create Prototype Portal tokens.
* If Mairsil gains an activated ability that's normally linked to another activated ability of the card it came from, those two abilities Mairsil gains are linked for as long as Mairsil remains on the battlefield. For example, if Mairsil exiles Izzet Chemister, cards exiled with the first ability Mairsil gained from Izzet Chemister can be cast if you activate the second ability it gained that way. Izzet Chemister itself can't be cast this way, and if Mairsil leaves the battlefield before activating that second ability, the cards exiled with that first ability are lost forever.
* If Mairsil has a crew ability, creatures can crew Mairsil. It'll become an artifact creature, but its power and toughness remain unchanged.
* If Mairsil has an equip ability, activating it won't cause anything to happen. Mairsil doesn't become attached to a creature. They may remain friends.

Mathas, Fiend Seeker  

RWB  

Legendary Creature — Vampire  

3/3  

Menace  

At the beginning of your end step, put a bounty counter on target creature an opponent controls. For as long as that creature has a bounty counter on it, it has "When this creature dies, each opponent draws a card and gains 2 life."


* The target creature that gets a bounty counter still has the triggered ability it gains even if Mathas leaves the battlefield.
* Creatures that receive a bounty counter other than from Mathas's ability resolving won't gain the triggered ability. Creatures that receive more than one bounty counter as Mathas's ability resolves (most likely due to Doubling Season) won't have the ability multiple times.
* If Mathas's ability resolves two separate times targeting the same creature, that creature will have two instances of the triggered ability. Each triggers separately when that creature dies.
* The opponents who each draw a card and gain 2 life are the opponents of the player who controlled the creature as it died. This may not be the player who controlled the creature when it received a bounty counter.

As long as Mirri, Weatherlight Duelist is tapped, no more than one creature can attack you each combat.

Mirror of the Forebears  

2  

Artifact  

As Mirror of the Forebears enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.  

1: Until end of turn, Mirror of the Forebears becomes a copy of target creature you control of the chosen type, except it's an artifact in addition to its other types.


* Once the second ability of Mirror of the Forebears resolves, it no longer has that ability.
* Mirror of the Forebears copies the printed values of the target creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on that creature or effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Notably, it won't copy effects that made the target creature become a creature.
* Mirror of the Forebears becomes an artifact in addition to its other types. This is a copiable value that other effects may copy.
* If Mirror of the Forebears copies a creature that's copying something else, it will become whatever the target is copying.
* If you activate the second ability of Mirror of the Forebears multiple times in a turn in response to itself, then each time one of those abilities resolves, it will overwrite whatever Mirror of the Forebears is copying. Mirror of the Forebears will wind up as a copy of the permanent targeted by the last ability to resolve. When the turn ends, all instances of the ability will wear off at the same time.
* If an effect begins to apply to Mirror of the Forebears before it becomes a copy of another permanent, that effect will continue to apply. For example, if Mirror of the Forebears is activated twice in response to itself targeting first Spirit of the Hearth then Temur Sabertooth, the ability it has while it's a copy of Temur Sabertooth can be activated and its effect will continue to apply while Mirror of the Forebears is a copy of Spirit of the Hearth.
* If Mirror of the Forebears becomes a creature the same turn it enters the battlefield, you can't attack with it or use any of its T abilities (if it gains any) unless it has haste.
* If Mirror of the Forebears becomes a copy of a legendary creature you control, you'll put one of them into your graveyard. The same is true if it becomes a copy of a planeswalker creature you control (such as a Gideon of the Trials that's become a creature).
* If you somehow control a Mirror of the Forebears with no chosen creature type, its activated ability can't be activated.
* If Mirror of the Forebears becomes a copy of a creature that itself has an ability that asks you to choose a creature type as it enters the battlefield and another ability that references "the chosen creature type," that ability won't have a choice made for it. You won't use the type chosen for Mirror of the Forebears.

Legendary Creature — Cat Artificer

When Nazahn, Revered Bladesmith enters the battlefield, search your library for an Equipment card and reveal it. If you reveal a card named Hammer of Nazahn this way, put it onto the battlefield. Otherwise, put that card into your hand. Then shuffle your library.  

Whenever an equipped creature you control attacks, you may tap target creature defending player controls.


* If more than one equipped creature you control attacks, Nazahn's last ability triggers once for each of those creatures. It doesn't trigger additional times for additional Equipment attached to an attacking creature.
* Nazahn's last ability can target a creature controlled only by the defending player who is being attacked by the attacking creature that caused the ability to trigger. For example, if an unequipped Nazahn is attacking player A and an equipped creature is attacking player B, Nazahn's ability can target only a creature player B controls.
* If a creature is attacking a planeswalker, its controller is that creature's defending player.

New Blood  

2BB  

Sorcery  

As an additional cost to cast New Blood, tap an untapped Vampire you control.  

Gain control of target creature. Change the text of that creature by replacing all instances of one creature type with Vampire.


* To pay the additional cost of New Blood, you may tap any untapped Vampire you control, including one you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn. (Note that tapping the creature doesn't use T [the tap symbol].)
* New Blood changes the creature type each time it appears in the creature's type line and/or rules text. It doesn't change the name of the card or any instances of the word being used as part of a card's name.
* You choose what word you're changing as New Blood resolves. You don't have to choose a word that appears in the creature's text.
* The creature you gain control of won't be a Vampire if you don't choose a creature type in that creature's type line as one to replace.
* New Blood's effect changes only the text printed on the creature. It can't change words found in abilities it's been granted. For example, if you change Rat to Vampire on Hungry Lynx, your Cats will have protection from Vampires; but if instead you change Rat to Vampire on Phantom Nishoba while you control a Hungry Lynx, Phantom Nishoba will have protection from Rats.
* The type-changing effect can change part of a word (such as "non-Human") if the part of the word is being used to refer to a creature type.

Flying, trample  

Whenever O-Kagachi, Vengeful Kami deals combat damage to a player, if that player attacked you during his or her last turn, exile target nonland permanent that player controls.


* A player attacked you if that player declared a creature as an attacking creature and that creature is attacking you. If that player attacked only planeswalkers you control, that player didn't attack you. If that player's creatures were attacking you only because they were put onto the battlefield attacking or only because you were reselected as the player they were attacking, that player didn't attack you.
* O-Kagachi's last ability exiles only one nonland permanent, no matter how many creatures attacked you or how many times that player attacked you during his or her last turn.
* If O-Kagachi deals lethal damage to a blocking creature and also deals damage to its controller, that blocking creature is destroyed before a target is selected for O-Kagachi's last ability. It can't be exiled.

Path of Ancestry  

Land  

Path of Ancestry enters the battlefield tapped.  

T: Add to your mana pool one mana of any color in your commander's color identity. When that mana is spent to cast a creature spell that shares a creature type with your commander, scry 1.


* The color identity of your commander is set before the game begins and doesn't change during the game, even if your commander is in a hidden zone (like the hand or library) or an effect changes your commander's color.
* Your commander's creature types are checked immediately after you cast a creature spell spending mana from Path of Ancestry's last ability. They aren't set before the game begins, and they may not be the same types your commander had when you activated that ability.
* If you cast your commander with mana from Path of Ancestry, and your commander hasn't somehow lost all of its creature types while on the stack, you'll scry 1.
* If mana from Path of Ancestry is spent to cast a creature spell that shares a type with your commander, you'll scry 1 before that spell resolves.
* If your commander is in a hidden zone (like the hand or library) or is phased out, it's considered to have no creature types.
* If your commander has no creature types, it can't share a creature type with any spell that you cast.
* If Path of Ancestry's last ability produces two mana (most likely due to Mana Reflection), you'll scry 1 twice if you spend those two mana to cast one creature spell that shares a type with your commander. You won't scry 2. You'll also scry 1 twice if you spend this mana to cast two creature spells that each share a type with your commander.
* On the other hand, if an ability triggers when you tap Path of Ancestry for mana and produces more mana (such as that of Zendikar Resurgent or Mirari's Wake), you'll scry 1 only once when you spend those two mana.
* If your commander is a card like Kozilek, Butcher of Truth that has no colors in its color identity, Path of Ancestry's last ability produces no mana.
* In formats other than Commander, Path of Ancestry's last ability produces no mana.

4/4  

Flying  

When Patron of the Vein enters the battlefield, destroy target creature an opponent controls.  

Whenever a creature an opponent controls dies, exile it and put a +1/+1 counter on each Vampire you control.


* Destroying a creature with Patron of the Vein's first ability causes its last ability to trigger if Patron of the Vein is still on the battlefield.
* Patron of the Vein's last ability puts a +1/+1 counter on each Vampire you control, including itself, even if the creature that died can't be exiled (most likely because it was a token).
* If Patron of the Vein and a creature an opponent controls die simultaneously (perhaps because they fought or were in combat together), Patron of the Vein's last ability triggers, but Patron of the Vein won't be on the battlefield as that ability resolves. It can't be saved by the +1/+1 counter that would have been put on it. The same is true of any other Vampires you control that die at the same time. Your remaining Vampires will each get a +1/+1 counter.

Flash  

When Portal Mage enters the battlefield during the declare attackers step, you may reselect which player or planeswalker target attacking creature is attacking. *(It can't attack its controller or its controller's planeswalkers.)*


* You may cast Portal Mage outside of a declare attackers step. If Portal Mage enters the battlefield outside of a declare attackers step, its ability simply doesn't trigger.
* Reselecting which player or planeswalker a creature is attacking ignores all requirements, restrictions, and costs associated with attacking.
* Reselecting which player or planeswalker a creature is attacking doesn't cause "when this creature attacks" abilities to trigger. Notably, the Curses in this set (such as Curse of Vitality) won't trigger while Portal Mage's ability is resolving.
* If you reselect which player or planeswalker an attacking creature is attacking, that creature is still considered to have attacked the player or planeswalker as declared, but it is now attacking the new player or planeswalker.
* If an ability targets something controlled by the "defending player" of an attacking creature and the defending player for that creature changes before that ability resolves, the ability will be countered because its target has become illegal.

Whenever you cast a spell, put a +1/+1 counter on Ramos, Dragon Engine for each of that spell's colors.  

Remove five +1/+1 counters from Ramos: Add WWUUBBRRGG to your mana pool. Activate this ability only once each turn.


* Ramos's triggered ability counts the number of colors a spell has (from zero to five), not how many colored mana symbols are there in its mana cost or how many colors of mana you spent.
* If you cast a colorless spell, Ramos's triggered ability triggers, but it won't get any +1/+1 counters.
* Ramos's triggered ability doesn't trigger until you've finished casting a spell, including paying all of its costs. If Ramos has fewer than five +1/+1 counters on it, there's no way to add counters with a spell and pay for that spell with the newly-added counters.
* Ramos's triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. The ability will resolve even if that spell is countered. If that spell is countered, use its last known information to determine what colors it was.

Put that card onto the battlefield and attach Shifting Shadow to it, then put all other cards revealed this way on the bottom of your library in a random order."


* If you don't reveal a creature card this way, you'll just reveal and randomize your library and Shifting Shadow becomes attached to nothing. It will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
* If Shifting Shadow can't become attached to the creature you put onto the battlefield, most likely because that creature has protection from red, it becomes attached to nothing. It will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
* If the Shifting Shadow leaves the battlefield after the triggered ability it grants has triggered but before it resolves, you'll destroy the creature it enchanted before it left the battlefield, then reveal cards and put a creature card onto the battlefield. Shifting Shadow won't become attached to it. The same is true if the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield rather than just Shifting Shadow, except that you won't destroy the creature it enchanted in that case.
* If the enchanted creature can't be destroyed, most likely because that creature has indestructible, you'll still get a new creature and attach Shifting Shadow to the new creature.

* There are several ways to secretly choose an opponent, including writing that player's name on a piece of paper that's kept with Stalking Leonin.
* If you have multiple Stalking Leonins, you may choose a different opponent for each one. Be careful to keep track of which opponent is chosen for each Stalking Leonin.
* If Stalking Leonin leaves the battlefield and returns, it's considered a new object. You may choose a new opponent and you may activate its last ability again.
* If you didn't choose an opponent when Stalking Leonin entered the battlefield, you can't pay the cost to activate its last ability. This will usually happen because you gained control of another player's Stalking Leonin or because a creature already on the battlefield became a copy of Stalking Leonin.
* If a creature is attacking a planeswalker you control, it's not attacking you. Stalking Leonin's last ability can't target it.

Legendary Creature — Human Monk  

3/4  

Instant, sorcery, and Dragon spells you control can't be countered by spells or abilities.  

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your hand, if Taigam, Ojutai Master attacked this turn, that spell gains rebound. *(Exile the spell as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast that card from exile without paying its mana cost.)*


* Spells that can't be countered by spells or abilities can still be countered by the game rules if all of their targets are illegal (because, for example, your creature gained hexproof in response to an opponent's spell).
* If Taigam leaves the battlefield after it attacks, its last ability won't trigger whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your hand this turn. If it leaves the battlefield after the spell has gained rebound, that spell will still have rebound. Once the card is exiled, rebound's delayed triggered ability will trigger at the beginning of your next upkeep even if you no longer control Taigam.
* If Taigam is killed in response to you casting a spell, the ability will still trigger and your spell will gain rebound if Taigam attacked.
* Casting the card again due to rebound's delayed triggered ability is optional. If you choose not to cast the card, or if you can't (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the card will stay exiled. You won't get another chance to cast it on a future turn.
* If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand is countered for any reason (either because of another spell or ability or because all its targets are illegal as it tries to resolve), that spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen, including rebound. The spell will be put into its owner's graveyard and you won't get to cast it again on your next turn.
* If a replacement effect (such as the one created by Rest in Peace) would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere other than into your graveyard as it resolves, you can choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
* If a spell moves itself into another zone as part of its resolution (as Teferi's Protection, All Suns' Dawn, and Beacon of Unrest do), rebound won't get a chance to apply.
* At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. A spell you cast this way resolves before you can cast the next one, so one rebounded spell can't target another. Timing permissions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," must be followed.
* If you cast a card from exile, it will go to its owner's graveyard when it resolves or is countered. It won't go back to exile.

Taigam, Sidisi's Hand  

3UB  

Legendary Creature — Human Wizard  

3/4  

Skip your draw step.  

At the beginning of your upkeep, look at the top three cards of your library. Put one of them into your hand and the rest into your graveyard.  

B, T, Exile X cards from your graveyard: Target creature gets -X/-X until end of turn.


* The "legend rule" cares about legendary permanents with the exact same English name. You can control Taigam, Sidisi's Hand and Taigam, Ojutai Master at the same time.

Teferi's Protection  

2W  

Instant  

Until your next turn, your life total can't change and you have protection from everything. All permanents you control phase out. *(While they're phased out, they're treated as though they don't exist. They phase in before you untap during your untap step.)*  

Exile Teferi's Protection.


The following notes focus on the "protection from" keyword:


* If a player has protection from everything, it means three things:
	+ All damage that would be dealt to that player is prevented.
	+ Auras can't be attached to that player.
	+ That player can't be the target of spells or abilities.
* Nothing other than the specified events are prevented or illegal. An effect that doesn't target you could still cause you to discard cards, for example. Creatures can still attack you while you have protection from everything, although combat damage that they would deal to you will be prevented.
* Gaining protection from everything causes a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target if it targets you. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability is countered and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.

The following notes focus on what it means if your life total can't change:


* Spells and abilities that would normally cause you to gain or lose life still resolve while your life total can't change, but the life-gain or life-loss part simply has no effect.
* Protection from everything will usually prevent damage if it would be dealt to you, but some damage can't be prevented. In this case, because your life total also can't change, that damage has any other effects that it may have aside from causing you to lose that much life (such as effects from lifelink or infect) and triggers and effects can see that damage was dealt even though your life total didn't change.
* You can't pay a cost that includes the payment of any amount of life other than 0 life.
* If a cost includes causing you to gain life (like the alternative cost of an opponent's Invigorate does), that cost can't be paid.
* Effects that would replace having you gain life with some other event won't be able to be applied because it's impossible for you to gain life. The same is true for effects that would replace having you lose life with some other event.
* Effects that replace an event with having you gain life (like Words of Worship's effect does) or having you lose life will apply and end up replacing the event with nothing.
* If an effect would set your life total to a certain number that's different than your current life total, that part of the effect won't do anything.
* If an effect would cause you to exchange life totals with another player, the exchange won't happen. Neither player's life total changes.

The following notes focus on the phasing keyword:


* While a permanent is phased out, it's treated as though it doesn't exist. It can't be the target of spells or abilities, its static abilities have no effect on the game, its triggered abilities can't trigger, it can't attack or block, and so on.
* Phasing out doesn't cause any "leaves the battlefield" abilities to trigger. Similarly, phasing in won't cause any "enters the battlefield" abilities to trigger.
* Any one-shot effects that are waiting "until [this] leaves the battlefield," such as that of Banishing Light, won't happen when a permanent phases out.
* Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration such as that of Mathas, Fiend Seeker ignore phased-out objects. Any such effects will expire if their conditions are no longer met after ignoring the phased-out objects.
* Each Aura and Equipment that phases out attached to a permanent that's phasing out phases in with that permanent and still attached to it.
* Each Aura and Equipment you control attached to a permanent that isn't phasing out phases in attached to that permanent if it can still be attached to that permanent. If not, it phases in unattached. An Aura that phases in unattached will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. The same is true with Auras attached to players.
* Permanents that phase out with counters phase in with those counters.
* Choices made for permanents as they entered the battlefield are remembered when they phase in.
* If a token is phased out, it will phase in as your next untap step begins. This is a change from previous rules.
* A permanent phasing out causes a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target if it targets that permanent. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability is countered and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.
* If your untap step is somehow skipped as your next turn begins, your phased-out permanents won't phase in until the next untap step you actually have, but you'll no longer have protection from everything and your life total can change again.
* Any creatures that phase in under your control as your next untap step begins will be able to attack and pay a cost of T during that turn.
* If you gain control of another player's permanent and it phases out, if the duration of the control-change effect expires before it phases in, that permanent phases in under that other player's control as your next untap step begins. If you leave the game before your next untap step, it phases in as the next untap step begins after your turn would have begun.

Territorial Hellkite  

2RR  

Creature — Dragon  

6/5  

Flying, haste  

At the beginning of combat on your turn, choose an opponent at random that Territorial Hellkite didn't attack during your last combat. Territorial Hellkite attacks that player this combat if able. If you can't choose an opponent this way, tap Territorial Hellkite.


* If Territorial Hellkite didn't attack during your last combat, most likely because it was tapped or you didn't control it at that time, then any opponent can be chosen at random.
* If a player can't be attacked, that player can still be chosen at random.
* Territorial Hellkite must attack the chosen player if able, not a planeswalker that player controls.
* Players may cast spells and activate abilities after a player is chosen at random for Territorial Hellkite but before it attacks that player.
* If Territorial Hellkite can't attack the chosen player, it's free to attack any other player or planeswalker or to not attack. If there's a cost associated with attacking the chosen player, it's free to attack any other player or planeswalker or to not attack. But if there's a cost associated with Territorial Hellkite attacking at all, Territorial Hellkite has to attack the chosen player or not attack.

The Ur-Dragon  

4WUBRG  

Legendary Creature — Dragon Avatar  

10/10  
*Eminence* — As long as The Ur-Dragon is in the command zone or on the battlefield, other Dragon spells you cast cost 1 less to cast.  

Flying  

Whenever one or more Dragons you control attack, draw that many cards, then you may put a permanent card from your hand onto the battlefield.


* You draw one card for each Dragon you controlled that attacked, even if some of them left the battlefield before The Ur-Dragon's triggered ability resolves.
* You may only put one permanent card from your hand onto the battlefield, no matter how many Dragons you attacked with or how many players they attacked.
* If a Dragon you control enters the battlefield attacking, it won't cause The Ur-Dragon's last ability to trigger.
* The Ur-Dragon's triggered ability resolves after all attackers have been chosen. You can't attack with some Dragons, put a creature card with haste onto the battlefield, and then attack with that creature. Similarly, any "whenever a creature attacks" abilities of the permanent card you put onto the battlefield won't trigger.

Vindictive Lich  

3B  

Creature — Zombie Wizard  

4/1  

When Vindictive Lich dies, choose one or more. Each mode must target a different player.  

• Target opponent sacrifices a creature.  

• Target opponent discards two cards.  

• Target opponent loses 5 life.


* You can't choose more modes for Vindictive Lich's triggered ability than you have opponents, but you need to choose at least one target if you can.
* You don't have to choose a mode for each opponent. For example, you could make one opponent lose 5 life and spare each other opponent. They might not repay your kindness.

Wasitora, Nekoru Queen  

2BRG  

Legendary Creature — Cat Dragon  

5/4  

Flying, trample  

Whenever Wasitora, Nekoru Queen deals combat damage to a player, that player sacrifices a creature. If the player can't, you create a 3/3 black, red, and green Cat Dragon creature token with flying.


* If a creature is dealt lethal combat damage at the same time that Wasitora deals combat damage to that creature's controller, that creature will be destroyed before that player chooses a creature to sacrifice.
