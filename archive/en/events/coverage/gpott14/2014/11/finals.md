One match for all the marbles. Both players have been here before and emerged victorious. Who will be the Champion? Neal Oliver, Team USA member and winner of the largest Grand Prix ever? Or will it be Seth Manfield, giving him a third GP title and the need to invest in a larger display case?



**The Games**




 Manfield passed on his first hand, but stuck with his six. Oliver didn't have his [Secret Plans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secret+Plans) on turn two, so the first action of the game was his morph the following turn. Manfield made [Bloodfire Expert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodfire+Expert). Olvier hit for two, then froze the Expert with [Crippling Chill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Chill) on Manfield's upkeep. Manfield played [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) and passed.
