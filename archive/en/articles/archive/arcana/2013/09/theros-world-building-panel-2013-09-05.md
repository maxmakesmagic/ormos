Last weekend PAX Prime happened here in Seattle, and it was awesome. Aside from thousands and thousands of gamers laying siege to Seattle, our epic **Magic** Party happened on Saturday, where we showed off a handful of *Theros* cards.

On Sunday, we brought a few hundred **Magic** fans into the Kraken Theatre and sat them down with some of R&D's creative team:

* Jeremy Jarvis
* Jenna Helland
* Doug Beyer
* Richard Whitters
* Jennifer "Tifa" Meyen (from brand)

We were able to livestream the panel thanks to the folks over at Twitch.tv, but in case you missed it here is our recording of the panel in its entirety. Enjoy!
