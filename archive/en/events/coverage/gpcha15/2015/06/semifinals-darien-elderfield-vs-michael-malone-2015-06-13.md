Darien Elderfield’s run was one of the major stories of the tournament, with his Ad Nauseam/[Phyrexian Unlife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Unlife)/Angel’s Grace combo deck storming through Day 1 undefeated and confounding opponents all along.


The deck aims to cast either [Phyrexian Unlife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Unlife) or Angel’s Grace to guarantee it won’t lose the game before following with Ad Nauseam, which allows the pilot to draw their deck and then win with [Lightning Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm) with protection from [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation).


As complex as Elderfield’s deck was, on the other side of the table sat one of *Magic’s* most basic concepts: casting small mana Elves and turning them sideways. And while it may not look like much, there’s a lot of hidden power in those forests. With cards like [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) and [Ezuri, Renegade Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%2C+Renegade+Leader) to dump all that mana into, Malone could end games in the blink of an eye.


**The Games**


Malone admitted to feeling like an underdog heading into the match, and a first-turn suspended [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) from Elderfield was enough to put the green player immediate on the back foot.


A [Phyrexian Unlife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Unlife) followed for Elderfield, and the combo player looked prime to go off, especially after he used two [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation) to counter first a [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) and then an [Elvish Archdruid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid) to buy more time.


But with his defenses down, Malone used the opportunity to resolve the trump card he’d been holding all along: [Reclamation Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclamation+Sage). It destroyed the [Phyrexian Unlife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Unlife) and Elderfield’s chances at the same time.

**Malone 1, Elderfield 0**


Malone’s deck aimed to be as streamlined as possible in the first game and as interactive as possible after sideboarding, something that was made clear when he played a [Burrenton Forge-Tender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Forge-Tender) on the second turn, putting a buffer between himself and death by [Lightning Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm).


Elderfield had a plan. With a [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) in his hand to eventually deal with the Forge-Tender, he cast [Phyrexian Unlife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Unlife) to prep his big turn and put the pressure on Malone.


Malone was ready for it. He attempted to destroy the Unlife with [Reclamation Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclamation+Sage), and in response Elderfield attempted to return it to his hand with [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal), confident he could handle the [Burrenton Forge-Tender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Forge-Tender) if only he were able to draw his entire deck.


But it wasn’t to be. Malone followed up with [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within) to destroy the [Phyrexian Unlife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Unlife) for good and sent Elderfield to the edge.


Still — hanging on at 4 life — the combo player had a plan. He cast [Spoils of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spoils+of+the+Vault) and named Angel’s Grace. It was a desperate play, but as Elderfield put it, if the named card wasn’t in the top four he wasn’t going to win anyway.


Four cards later, the players had their answer. Angel’s Grace didn’t turn up, Elderfield’s life dropped to 0 and he extended his hand to the Elves player.
