Hopefully, your Prerelease last weekend was a blast whether you went 4-0 or 0-4. Prereleases are meant to be fun experiences where a local store basically hosts a party for everyone to play *Magic*.


A number of stores take that concept to another level, and we'd like to highlight some of them today and ask you which one looks like the most fun. Pick any one that appeals to you. The winning store will be featured in a future DailyMTG article!


Click on the images below to scroll through the pictures. Once youâ€™ve scrolled through all of the photos, click on the store you liked the best!
