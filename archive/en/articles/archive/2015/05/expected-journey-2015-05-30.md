Call it enthusiasm, call it devotion, call it obsession. Regardless, over ten thousand players will be celebrating *Modern Masters* this weekend.


Perhaps what is most amazing about our passion for *Magic* is how it also keeps families closely knitted together. You might have already checked out our ["Around the Multiverse" Facebook Gallery](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10155551238040307.1073741881.201120755306&type=1) earlier, but just in case you haven't, here is a picture of Richmond Tan and his beautiful family.

Richmond is one of the most well-known and well-respected members of the Philippines *Magic* Community and has been playing *Magic* for a long, long time. Together with his wife and their two sons, they have made the trip to Chiba to indulge in a weekend of *Magic* festivities with thousands of other *Magic* fans.


**Richmond:** It's the biggest event of the year, as a hardcore *Magic* fan, I could not possibly miss out on this one. It was not a matter of whether I wanted to go, but which event I would bring my family to. I only have eight days, so I chose to come to Chiba. If I was given another week, I would seriously reconsider flying to Utrecht or Las Vegas.

Richmond has been a hobbyist for as long as he could remember. He once told me that, he used to collect basketball cards but he couldn't play with those.


**Richmond:** They sit in the albums, looking pretty. Then I found out about *Magic* and sold all my basketball cards and made the switch. I now collect *Magic* cards instead. Haha!”


The journey of a lifetime began when he started to date Rowena. They started to play *Magic* together when they met, while they were dating and it continued until even after they got married. To this day, *Magic* remains one of the strongest bonding agents that holds them together closer than ever.


**Richmond:** I made Top 8 of Grand Prix Manila while my wife was pregnant with our youngest son. My wife and oldest son play with me now. I'm a truly blessed man.


**Rowena:** Playing *Magic* is a great way to help expand your ability to learn. We intend to teach our two-year-old baby boy how to play *Magic* when he turns six or seven.


**Richmond:** Maybe that will be sometime around *Modern Masters* 2020, if that even exists? Haha! We'll see!


**Chapman:** How is your weekend so far?


**Rowena:** As far as I'm concerned, mine is going great! The tournament hall is large and spacious and everyone has been really friendly and polite. Also, I got a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) in my Sealed deck. That's bound to make anyone happy, right?


**Richmond:** My deck looks very good but I'm a little light on removal.


I glanced over at his deck and saw a bunch of bombs in Richmond's two-color deck, which included [Creakwood Liege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creakwood+Liege), [Endrek Sahr, Master Breeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endrek+Sahr%2C+Master+Breeder), [Precursor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precursor+Golem) and [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated). With two byes, it is Richmond's hope that he can make Day 2.

**Chapman:** So, who’s the best player in the family?


**Rowena:** Richmond is.


**Richmond's sons:** Daddy is!


All Richmond Tan could do was to smile and agree.
