After 17 rounds of competition, all that stood between Maximiliano Ramiro Sanchez and a Grand Prix title was one man. One very formidable man. Hall of Famer Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa was playing for much more than his second Grand Prix title though.



With Thiago Saporito and Willy Edel both picking up three Pro Points this weekend, this bumps them up to 42 and 40 respectively. A win here would put da Rosa at 43, enough to become the new point leader for Brazil. More importantly, he was also playing to lock up Platinum!




**Game One**



Playing first, Damo da Rosa used [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) to alleviate himself from Heir of the Wilds, and killed [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) with Bile Blight.

Ashiok, [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) Weaver “milled” [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) from the top of Sanchez’s deck, and da Rosa wasted no time putting it into play. This was amusing because Damo da Rosa had yet to find Ojutai or Silumgar, and had to rely on his opponent's dragon to “switch on” both of Silumgar’s Scorn in his hand.



Silumgar’s Scorn countered Surrak, the Hunt Caller, and Hero’s Downfall dealt with the pesky Boon Satyr. Damo da Rosa drew into one of his four copies of [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) two turns later, and dropped it without hesitation.



After the Ojutai's first attack, things started to spiral downwards for Sanchez. Still holding Silumgar’s Scorn, Damo da Rosa could smell victory and his sense of smell is usually quite good.

**Game Two**



Sanchez was back against the wall and needed to win the next two games or go home as the runner-up. He was not blessed with a fast start and could only offer [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) as the first sacrificial lamb against Esper Dragon's plethora of removal. It quickly met with Bile Blight.



[Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) jumped to its death via Foul-Tongue Invocation. [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) killed Thunderbreak Regent. Sanchez was having difficulty getting a threat to stick around long enough.

*Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa deftly neutralizes all opposing threats.*



[Surrak, the Hunt Caller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surrak%2C+the+Hunt+Caller) and a replacement [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) hit the board, matched by Damo da Rosa's Dragonlord Ojutai. However, it seemed like the game was over when Damo da Rosa untapped.

He was ready for those two threats with [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) and Foul-Tongue Invocation. Only four more attacks with [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) stood in the way of victory. Damo da Rosa made sure the champion trophy was his with a Dig Through Time, finding a second [Silumgar's Scorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Scorn) to cement his victory.
