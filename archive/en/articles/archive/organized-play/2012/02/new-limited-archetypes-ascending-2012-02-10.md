In every Limited format, there are going to be color combinations that work really well together. Sometimes color combinations will soar to the top thanks to cards like [Travel Preparations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Travel+Preparations) and [Stromkirk Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Captain), which give you an incentive for playing two (or more) colors. While other times, you will find decks like Blue-Green Mill Yourself and Blue-Red [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) which excel because of synergies between colors that go beyond merely having good multi-colored cards.


There's still a lot of time for players to discover new archetypes in *Dark Ascension* Booster Draft, but even with the format in its infancy, players have found consistent success with decks that were scarcely playable in *Innistrad*.


For example: werewolves have finally clawed their way into the spotlight.


 

### Werewolves!

After a rough start in Standard, four-time Pro Tour Top 8 competitor Patrick Chapin 3-0'd his pod with an aggressive Red-Green Werewolf deck.
