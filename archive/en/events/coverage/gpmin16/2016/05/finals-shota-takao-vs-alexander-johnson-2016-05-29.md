After fifteen rounds of Swiss and two elimination rounds the final round of Grand Prix Minneapolis was about to begin.


“Humans did really well this tournament. There were four Humans decks in Top 8,” Alex said as he looked through Shota's decklist. Shota remained relatively quiet as he looked through Alex's decklist but did have to ask the judge what [Angelic Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Purge) did.


Shota ran over both his quarterfinals and semifinals opponent in roughly fifteen minutes total with his hyper-aggressive Red-White humans list featuring double-digit one-drops and [Reckless Bushwhacker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Bushwhacker). Hometown hero Alex was piloting a white creature deck as well, but a more midrangey Green-White Tokens list.

Shota was the higher seed and elected to play first. Both players wished each other good luck and drew their opening hands. “I keep,” said Shota.


“Mulligan,” said Alex as he threw his hand back into his deck. He was happy with his hand of six cards and scryed a card to the top.


An [Expedition Envoy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Envoy) and a [Dragon Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Hunter) started things off for Shota while Alex summoned a [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) to stop the 2/1 beatdowns. Shota missed his second land drop and had no choice but to turn his guys sideways and continue to play one-drops. Alex happily traded his Walker for one of the 2/1s and created a thopter token. He was going to need all the blockers he could get.


Alex played a second [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) for one while Shota continued to play one-drops and not play lands. With Alex having two blockers on the battlefield, Shota had to pass the turn without attacking. [Town Gossipmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Town+Gossipmonger) transformed, forcing the attack, and Alex happily blocked with [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker). [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) caused the Walker to fight and trade with the transformed [Town Gossipmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Town+Gossipmonger) and three thopter tokens were created on Alex's side.


[Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) came down for Alex's and Shota was falling further and further behind. He drew a card for his turn but it was not the second land he was looking for and he scooped up his cards and shuffled up for Game 2.


**Alex Johnson - 1, Shota Takao - 0**


“You're going to play first correct?” asked Alex. “Yep.” Players took some time to sideboard and randomize their decks and after drawing opening hands Shota quickly took a mulligan while Alex kept his seven.


Shota found a six card hand he was happy with and after a scry to the top the players were on to Game 2.

*Shota Takao*


Shota began the game with a [Kytheon, Hero of Akros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kytheon%2C+Hero+of+Akros) into a [Thraben Inspector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Inspector) while Alex cast a [Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone) to remove the Legendary creature. Thalia's Lieutenant pumped the Inspector in an attempt to get in some early beatdown but Alex had a second Declaration to take care of it.


Abbot of Keral keep revealed an uncastable [Silkwrap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silkwrap) off the top of Shota's deck and the beats continued, threatening Alex's life total. However, Alex was able to turn the corner on turn four by playing a [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) and then a [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) to pump the Advocate and fight the Abbot. With a 3/4 blocker in play, the attacks came to a halt for Shota.


Alex's follow-up was a second [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) which gave him an incentive to start attacking. All Shota could do was play a fifth land and pass the turn. Alex had yet another [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) to fight Shota's last creature but Shota had [Stasis Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Snare) to take out the target of the fight spell. However Alex had [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) number *three*, this time to force Shota to sacrifice an enchantment with the [Stasis Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Snare) trigger on the stack. With the Snare gone, the target for the first [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) was never removed and the fight spell resolved, taking out Shota's final creature.


Alex's board state was two copies of [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate), one with a +1/+1 counter and another with two +1/+1 counters while Shota had a board of nothing but lands. Shota had gotten into a position where was forced to chump block with every creature he played. Eventually a sixth land came down for Alex, pumping the [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate)s and after a few more attacks Alex had won the game.
