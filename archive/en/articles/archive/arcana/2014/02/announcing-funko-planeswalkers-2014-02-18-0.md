 This past weekend, at Toy Fair, Funko announced that they are creating new vinyl figures of our Planeswalkers. From the [press release](http://company.wizards.com/content/funko-announces-licensing-agreement-wizards-coast-produce-magic-gathering-planeswalker): 

 The first series of Pop! Vinyl figures, set to release in April, will feature iconic **Magic: The Gathering** Planeswalkers Jace Beleren, Garruk Wildspeaker, Chandra Nalaar, Liliana Vess, Ajani Goldmane, and Nissa Revane. Funko Pop! Vinyl figures are 3.75 inch tall super stylized vinyl figures.

 Funko is also excited to announce that we have teamed up with talented sculptors at Gentle Giant to create Funko's new Legacy Collection line of 6 inch, deluxe action figures featuring 20+ points of articulation and removable accessories for ages 14+. Set to release in August, the **Magic: The Gathering** Planeswalkers will be among the first Legacy Collection figures released, and you can expect the same iconic Planeswalkers as those released in Pop! Vinyl.
