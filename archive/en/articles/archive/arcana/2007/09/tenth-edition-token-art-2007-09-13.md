Way back at the beginning of the summer we showed you that [token cards](/en/articles/archive/tenth-editions-tips-tricks-tokens-2007-06-18) would be in *Tenth Edition*. Today we take a look at the art created for of each of these tokens, and the *Tenth* cards that would generate them. If it turns out that there are token-generating cards in *Lorwyn* (and there just might be), you'll find all-new token cards in packs of *Lorwyn*.
