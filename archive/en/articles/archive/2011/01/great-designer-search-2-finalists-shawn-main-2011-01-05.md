### Comments:


For this challenge, at shdwcat's suggestion, I've embraced elements of Norse mythology to help define Wodotha's natives. Assault, now moved to its proper place in white, green, and red, represents Wodotha's warrior clans and a world in frenzy. Playtesting confirmed the sorts of cards that enable assaults (tokens, evasion, and haste in particular). Blight too is a useful tool for encouraging assault, as creatures marked for death can play a little looser and sacrifice themselves to aid their kinsmen.


I wanted this pack to show not only the primary colors blight will appear in, but some of the breadth of interactions it can set up. I found blighting is at its most interesting when it appears on creatures (like Doom Herald) or sorceries with secondary effects (like Blight Delirium). This allows blight spells to play well outside of a dedicated blight deck and prevents them from being collect all/collect none in drafts. Instant speed blight, however, needs to be a little more deliberate, as it can lead to surprise kills even on innocuous-looking cards like Wilt Away.


Many attempts were made to codify desperate searching mechanics, but scry did everything Wodotha needed, representing a world looking for answers. Though it will appear here in multiple colors, scry helps define blue's role as the color of oracles through cards, like Walking Prophecy, that care about the top of your library.
