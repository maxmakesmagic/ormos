[日本語の取材へ](http://mtg-jp.com/eventc/jpnats10/) 
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat10/winners2.jpg)The 2010 Japan National Championship has drawn to a close! The Top 8 was set with four seasoned veterans of the Pro Tour and four newcomers to the premier level stage. The vets? Former Player of the Year Shouta Yasooka, Pro Tour Top 8er Naoki Shimizu, the legendary Tsuyoshi Ikeda, and former world champion Katsuhiro Mori.


Across the bracket from those four were a host of names little was known about. For Ryouichi Tamada, Shou Tagomori, Shou Ishikawa, and Jinpei Hassaku it was their chance to make their mark on the Japanese scene. Tagomori and Tamada escaped the Quarterfinals but were felled in the Semifinals by the more seasoned of their compatriots. That set up a playoff between the two in order to determine which would join his teammates to represent Team Japan at the 2010 World Championships. The winner? Shou Tagomori.


All that set up a Finals between legends Katsuhiro Mori and Tsuyoshi Ikeda. Tsuyoshi had beaten one red deck already on the day but Mori was no average red mage. Throughout the Top 8 he had managed to open on a first turn [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), one of the most powerful plays in Standard, nearly every game. He continued that streak through the Finals allowing him to sweep his opponent to repeat and become a two-time Japanese National Champion.


Congratulations to Katsuhiro Mori, the 2010 Japanese National Champion!
