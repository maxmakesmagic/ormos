Greg Staples's art of [Judge Unworthy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge+Unworthy) was originally commissioned for a card in "Snap," the set that later became *Time Spiral*. Greg Staples's piece was commissioned for a Phyrexian shadow creature, but the needs of the cards changed and there was nowhere for the finished piece to go.

*All dressed up and nowhere to go!  

Art by Greg Staples*
The art ended up in the art "graveyard," that sad place inside Wizards' Multiverse database where homeless art winds up. There the art languished until some kind-hearted creative team member decided to place it on another card, in this case a white removal spell in "Pop," the set that would become *Future Sight*.


Instead of a Phyrexian monster stretched between planes, the art is now seen as a source of pure energy rescinding the existence of a marauding evil creature. In a classic story of art meets card, art loses card, art finds new cardâ€”the happy ending was finally achieved. The only sad character in this story might be the victim of the spell. Eat a blast of holy light, creature of darkness!
