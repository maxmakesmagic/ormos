Back in the day, I used to write multiple mailbag columns a year. While I still read every piece of mail sent to me (and respond to the few I can), I realized that I hadn't done a traditional mailbag column in quite some time. This week I'm going to rectify this situation by doing a good old-fashioned mailbag column. On with the letters:

Bob,

Let me just rip off the Band-Aid. This year there isn't going to be a **Magic** Invitational. As part of our Organized Play Department's refocusing on grass roots programs, the Invitational was cut from this year's schedule. What does this mean for the future of the Invitational? I honestly don't know. The Invitational has had many bumps along its way, and we have previously held Invitationals held over a year and a half apart. It has been repurposed numerous times and, as it is my baby, I hope we will be able to do so yet again. That said, as of today, there are no current plans for when and where the next Invitational will be held.

Kyle,

Antoine's card is in *Shards of Alara*. It was originally going to appear in *Shadowmoor* but, as you surmised, the setting had no humans, and Antoine needed to be pictured on the card. We were forced to move it off to the next large set. Along the way, it went through a few changes. You'll have to wait until the card becomes public to see what those changes are, but as a little teaser, let me show off the art from the card. For the first time ever, here is Ranger of Eos:

Will this ever be a sanctioned format? It seems like a really fun and interesting format, allowing people to play with awesome old cards but without needing to get expensive dual lands or power pieces. I haven't gotten the chance to play it for real, but it seems like a blast.

Jay,

As I explained last year when I introduced the format, it was created to fill a gap that I see coming down the road. As **Magic** gets older and older, I believe there is going to be need for a format that gives access to all of **Magic** (well, most of **Magic**) without allowing all of it at once. Choose Your Own Standard was my suggestion to fill that void. The format got very good feedback from the players. The problem is that while I believe the void in question is coming, I don't think it's quite here yet. As such, no one other than me inside Wizards is really looking to fill it. 

For fans of CYOS I think time is on our side. I believe when the void comes that this format will have some legs to be able to step up (see it has legs, thus it can step up) and try to fill the void. If you enjoy the format I strongly urge you to try and find people to run it locally. Like most homebrewed formats, I think this one's going to take some time to ferment. But don't worry, I haven't forgotten about it. I still bring it up from time to time.

![Stream Hopper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stream+Hopper)Travis,

One of the things we liked to do in *Time Spiral* was take two older cards and merge them together. [Stream Hopper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stream+Hopper) is an interesting hybrid design wherein each version was already done as its own card. The card was done in red in Alpha as [Goblin Balloon Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Balloon+Brigade) and then in blue in *Tempest* as [Manta Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manta+Riders). As neither card was all that powerful we decided in *Eventide* design that it was okay to repeat both cards in a hybrid version. The card led to us discussing what other hybrid cards we could design in which both halves had already been printed. Feel free to discuss this in this week's thread.

Ken,

The reason I, or for that matter Wizards, hasn't responded is that there isn't much for us to say. There are changes coming. We [told you what the changes are](/en/node/617866). We explained why we chose to make them. There was a public outcry, as there has been every time we've ever announced a major change (more on this in a moment). We are interested in hearing feedback about the changes, but that cannot happen until the public gets a chance to actually see what we've done. 

On a side note for those that enjoy historical context, this announcement was not the "loudest outcry from the **Magic** community, EVER." We received more mail for both the announcement of the *Sixth Edition* rules change and of the *Eighth Edition* card face change. Also, the announcement of the creation of Standard (back then called "Type II") created a greater amount of verbiage online (note that this was before I worked for Wizards and most of the discussion was on the Usenet boards).

I'm not trying in any way to demean this outcry. It was large and very vocal, and yes we do care what you all have to say. I just want to put it in context that big changes to the game always result in big responses from the public. I simply ask that you wait to see the changes so that any discussion comes from talking about what *has* been done rather than you having to speculate on what *might* have been done.

>  -alastair

Alastair,

One of the biggest expectations of the players is that new sets will have new mechanics. Because all our market research says our players value this highly, we make sure to do it every set. Conspire was dropped because there simply wasn't enough room to do everything that *Shadowmoor* did and add new mechanics in a smaller sized set. Why drop conspire? Because we felt there were fewer interesting things we could do with it in *Eventide* as contrasted against *Shadowmoor's* other mechanics. One of the hardest parts of design is taking out things that don't fit. Conspire was one such casualty. As to why we choose retrace over conspire when conspire fit better into the "color matters" theme, please remember that [the original version of retrace](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/eventide-pool-2008-07-07) did care about color.

Dylan,

I'm planning to phase out all **Magic** content by May of 2010. Kidding. I'm kidding.

One man's trash is another man's treasure. Every Making Magic column I've ever written has had something to do with either **Magic** or design, most often both. The problem is that sometimes I talk about a part of **Magic** / design that you don't care about. Thus to you, it's an empty column. Here's the problem. To other readers it's a part they do care about. 

For example, from time to time I do articles where I explore some flavor aspect of the game in a very colorful way. Examples of these would be articles like [I cc: Dead People](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr61), [Dear Diary](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr94) and [IM Legend](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/im-legend-2008-06-09). There is a segment of my readership that loves these columns. The three I mentioned above, for example, are in my top twenty of all time (and I've written almost 350 Making Magic articles) in responses they generated. How creature types are used, how a common evolves, and how the colors are represented are all meaty design issues. Maybe not meaty design issues you care about, but they are things that I as Head Designer very much have to care about and thus are fair game, as far as I'm concerned, for topics. 

In addition, while I like to use Making Magic to inform, I also have to use it to entertain. My solution to this problem is to keep rotating the type of columns I write. This way everyone gets to see the type of article they like some of the time. Hmm, kind of the way that I have to design different types of cards each set so every player finds something they enjoy in each expansion.

Maybe a Facebook parody wasn't your cup of tea. Luckily, it's done. You don't have to see it ever again. Will I do something else equally "silly" in the future? Of course. Because if I didn't I would get a letter like yours asking me why I'm always so dry and serious. What I can promise you is that I promise to write the kind of articles you like... some of the time.

> ![Shielding Plax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shielding+Plax)Dear Mister Rosewater,
>  Now that Eventide is out and the "Hybrid Block" is complete, making Hybrid a force to be reckoned with in the world of Magic, I was just wondering if we would see more it in other sets. Sets not designed to be 'a hybrid block' like Shadowmoor / Eventide or 'a multicolor block' like Ravnica. What I am asking is if we will see Hybrid cards showing up in sets like they did during Ravnica, alongside the more traditional 'gold cards'. I personally have loved the idea behind Hybrid Mana since it first came out and would love for it to become a standard part of the game. I can see a lot of potential for it even alongside 'gold cards', especially the 'if both' type of Hybrid card such as Firespout. I would really hate for such a great mechanic as Hybrid to fall by the wayside when I feel it adds so much to the game.

R.J.,

I see hybrid not as a mechanic but as a tool, much as I see traditional multicolor (a.k.a. "gold cards"). My plan is that hybrid will be treated very similarly. Yes, we will have the occasional block built around it, but it is a tool that will be available to other sets much like we use gold cards in sets not all about multicolor cards. I will even be so bold as to predict that you will see hybrid used again before the next hybrid block.

And while apparently most of your players aren't all that good at pattern recognition (and you probably do enough market research to know how smart your audience is), I still find it insulting.

Jeffrey,

I'll be blunt. When we have to decide between making sure players understand what cards do and insulting those who already get it, there isn't much of choice. Err to one side and we lose players who aren't able to get into the game and probably never will return. Err on the other and we get grumbly players who keep playing but occasionally send me letters like yours. I'll gladly take the grumbly letters if it means we get more people into the game. In short, I apologize if you feel insulted, but it's for what I feel is a greater cause.

Matt,

Believe or not, I haven't actually read many books on game design. Up until the last few years there really weren't many, and having three kids has significantly cut down on my available reading time. So I turned to an R&D member who I consider an expert in this area, Brian Tinsman, R&D's head designer of new games.

Brian recommended the following:

* *A Theory of Fun for Game Design* by Ralph Koster. Brian felt it was pretty theoretical but had a wonderful approach that's relevant to games in all categories.
* *Game Design Workshop* by Tracy Fullerton. This book is mostly focused on video games, but it had the best step-by-step "how to design a good game" approach that Brian had seen. The book draws on principles from many genres.
* *New Rules For Classic Games* by R. Wayne Schmittberger. This isn't a game design book per se, but Brian felt it had some wonderful examples of how to change games to meet different player needs, essentially what Wizards' development process is all about.

And I'll recommend the following:

* *The Game Inventor's Guidebook* by Brian Tinsman. This is one I have read, and since Brian was too humble to peddle his own book, I will. The book is mostly focused on how to get a game published once it's designed but it covers all the fundamentals of the game design process and interviews just about every name game designer (myself included) in the business. The book is currently out of print, but it's due to be reprinted November 1st.

Finally, I'm forced (by the same powers that keep making "Roseanne" references show up) to also mention that my favorite book, *A Whack on the Side of the Head* by Roger von Oech, is an excellent book on creative thinking, and also a must for any aspiring game designer.

Brad,

"Design space" is a term I've tossed around a lot. I searched through my archive, and I haven't specifically touched upon what exactly "design space" means. So, you are correct, it would be an excellent topic for a column. I will try to write it before the year is out. Thanks for the suggestion.

> "Power Creep" is always a fear with trading card games, and Magic has always been accused of it, on and off. Less informed players cite R+D slip-ups such as Targmogoyf while more knowledgeable but still concerned players may cite "experimental" cards like Isamaru. I have an alternate hypothesis about Magic that I was wondering if you could verify. I call it "fun creep." The basis is fairly simple:
>

> R+D is intentionally making more enjoyable aspects of the game more powerful.
> 
> 
> The easiest example of this is how much creatures have improved: Creatures are the most interactive and thus fun part of the game, so it makes sense R+D should encourage people to play with them. The power level of creatures has risen continuously over the years: Juzam Djinn was considered the best creature of all time when it was printed, but its recent re-print Plague Sliver never saw serious constructed play. The "broken" cards in Alpha consist of mana-producers (Moxen, dual lands) and overpowered 1-3 mana instants and sorceries (Time Walk, Ancestral Recall, Dark Ritual). The two best creatures in Alpha, Hypnotic Specter and Llanowar Elves, are still core-set staples.

> 
> Other examples of "fun creep" include increases in the power of auras (creature enchantments are fun, but the inherent card disadvantage kept them from seeing much tournament play with a few exceptions), life gain's continuous improvement, and the massive, exponential improvements in the quality of huge creatures.

> In short, my central question comes down to: Do you feel that "fun creep" is actually occurring, and if so, is it an intentional move on the part of R+D or a self-causing natural process?

Devon,

You caught us. We have been actively trying to make the game more fun. I think the idea of "fun creep" is a little inaccurate though. The danger behind "power creep" is that sets have to keep getting more powerful to compete with the sets that came before. Why? Because power is relative. In order for something to be powerful it has to be more powerful than the majority of other things. Fun doesn't quite work like this. 

Something can be just as fun as something else without having to trump the previous fun. Fun is a threshold. To make something fun, you just have to pass that threshold. As long as it crosses the line, it's fun. Fun doesn't have to compete with other fun. For example, how much my children loved ice cream yesterday has no relevance on whether they'll enjoy going to the playground tomorrow.

What this means is we can ratchet up the fun in the game without causing ourselves any long term design or development issues. Our master plan, which thanks to you is now out of the bag, is to make every set as fun as we can.

David,

My goal in naming the merfolk wasn't to be original but to make the reader get that she was a merfolk. So yes, I chose the best-known mermaid in pop culture. A common design trap is to look for the most original answer when the most functional one will better serve the task.

Reinout,

[Maro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maro) is my nickname. It comes from **Ma**rk **Ro**sewater. During *Mirage* development, I created a card to fill a hole. Bill Rose called it [Maro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maro) because that was what he typed into his computer when he wanted to write me an email (the system would fill in names if there was only one combination that fit) and the name somehow made it through the system and wound up on the printed card. Since then, it has been my nickname. I'm guessing that lacking that information made IM Legend a very different read for you. ("Why are the colors talking to a nature elemental?")

Andy,

Everyone always seem dumbfounded that I don't have an office. I think it stems from the fact that so many people seem to want to believe that I single-handedly run **Magic**. I don't, by the way. The real answer is that I'm just not high enough up the corporate food chain. My boss (Aaron Forsythe, director of **Magic** R&D) has an office and his boss (Bill Rose, vice president of R&D) has an office and his boss (Greg Leeds, CEO of Wizards of the Coast) has an office. So close.

I should stress that I don't really want an office as I enjoy being in the Pit. A great deal of the fun of being in R&D is being able to interact with everyone and sitting alone in an office would mean I'd miss many of the little moments that make working in R&D so enjoyable. (My money, by the way, is on Gandalf beating Yoda in one on one basketball.)

Myrlin,

And with that, I'll call this article a wrap. I hope you enjoyed today's trip through the mailbag. Let me end by reminding you all that I allow any **Magic** player to have my ear if he or she takes the time to write. I read every letter sent to me. (Although I am unable to respond to most of them.) You have an opinion and want it heard by the guy who singlehandedly runs **Magic**. Here's your chance. Part of my secret to doing what I do is listening to all of you, so please if you like or dislike something we're doing, let me know. It really does impact how I, and the rest of R&D, make the game.

Join me next week when I talk all about the little people.

Until then, may you be so blessed as to have people give you feedback on what you do for a living.
