Huey was sporting his all-foil U/R/b deck against Kibler's identical, although non-foil, deck. The two tested together for this tournament along with Ben Rubin and the rest of the Magic Colony. Kibler needs 7 Pro Points at this tournament to qualify for the Masters Series, and Huey is almost on the Masters himself. The problem is, both of them are sporting 1-2 records thus far; the loser will not be playing on Saturday.

### Game 1

They got right into the burn race, Huey casting [Fiery Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper) and [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption), Kibler casting a [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption) of his own. Huey got out a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), and got in some more damage. He discarded [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption) number two to his [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Brian got out a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) of his own, it took two Aether Bursts to get rid of, but Huey did it and Kibler said, "I die."

### Game 2

Kibler elected to be the primary gamer. He got out an early [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), dealt some early damage to Huey until Huey could draw Edict. Jensen got out a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) of his own, along with a [Cephalid Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter). Kibler cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and followed it up with a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Brian said "I win," then Huey scooped.

### Game 3

Kibler kept his hand after he muliganned down to five. However, he got a second turn [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) which helped him cycle through to some of the better cards in his deck. Huey cast [Haunting Echoes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes) to remove the one card, [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption), in Kibler's graveyard. The two got into a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) battle which ended up in a trade of the two [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)s. Kibler then cast another one and sent it into the red zone. He began cycling more to [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) to fuel his [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). A few turns later Kibler was doing [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)/[Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) math, and figured he had one or two turns left before he could kill Huey. Kibler cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval)/[Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) again and Huey scooped.
