As for promo cards this season, it's all Matt Cavotta, all the time. Just for showing up, you get a full-art [Blood Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight), while supplies last:It's all-out war this weekend, and you and your buddy's home turf is at stake. It's [Champs](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/champs) time (also known as [States](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/states) in the US), and it's Two-Headed Giant Limited. Find another head and [read up](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/states) on the details before some, um, shall we say, *lesser minds* from across town manage to claim bragging rights over *your* layer of matted earth.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana/1281_cbk.jpg)If you make Top 4, you'll get a premium foil full-art [Groundbreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundbreaker) -- but we're keeping that one a secret for now. If you want to see it, you'd better find that perfect second head to win the card.


In addition, Top 4 teams get playmats (one per head), and the winning team gets a pair of victory plaques (one per head).


Two-Headed Giant Limited [States](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/states) / [Champs](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/champs) 2007. Heads will roll.
