The 1464-player field was reduced to two players with the title at stake as the final table was set at last. One match would crown a champion and the stakes were almost as high as the heat wave temperature in the Czech Republic.


The Players
===========


Eliott Boussaud, the tutor from Toulouse proved his prowess in Standard at Grand Prix Utrecht in 2014 by making the finals. That time the title as champion escaped him, but he's been after it ever since.


Between him and his goal stood Belgian Peter Vieren, a calm and collected 29-year-old who's one Grand Prix Top 8 was in Lyon 2010. The format then? Rise of the Eldrazi limited. Perhaps fitting when we are headed back to Eldrazi-land with Battle for Zendikar in a few weeks.


The Decks
=========


A lot has been said about [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) this weekend. And in the finals it was two Hangarbacks for Boussaud against zero for Vieren. Their decks choices being Red-Black Dragons and Blue-Black Control respectively.


It would be a finals of [Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%27s+Fury) against [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death). France against neighboring Belgium in an all dragon derby.


“Can I read Kolaghan, just to make sure?” Peter Vieren asked as the players looked through each others deck before the match in a sportsmanlike matter.


“One [Pearl Lake Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pearl+Lake+Ancient) and one Silumgar. Are you going to win by milling me out?” was Boussad's reply when he saw Vieren's threat light deck.


“Challenge accepted,” he laughed and they shuffled up for the action.


The Games
=========


The first game proved to be a hard battle to fight for Boussad. Mostly because the removal half of his deck would be virtually irrelevant against Vieren's creature-less deck. Instead he would have to present his threats and hope that Vieren would run out of answers before refilling his hand with card drawing spells like [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity) and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time).


And the attempts started:


[Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent)? [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall).


[Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent)? [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall).


[Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)? [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate).


[Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent)? [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve).


[Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%27s+Fury)? [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve).


A series of event that could dishearten even the bravest Dragon-wielder. Boussad however, seemed unaffected by his failures and cast one of his four [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) to try to return one of his dragons.


Vieren's answer? Another [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve).


A second copy of [Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%27s+Fury)? [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall).


Boussad was now left with nothing but removal in his hand. Surely just waiting to be able to replace them with [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege), [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster) and [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) after sideboarding.


Peter Vieren, like he had been doing all weekend, refilled his hand with [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity) after [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity). Surely Boussad started to realize that he was out of the game, but still not able to concede because of Vieren's lack of win conditions.


In the end Boussad's hand ended up so full of removal that he had to discard to hand size. Peter Vieren went for one of his win conditions. [Cranial Archive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Archive), allowing him to shuffle back all his removal back into his deck and eventually killing every single creature from Boussad with his continuous card drawing. In other words – who needs win conditions when you can have endless removal and card drawing?


Boussad played out the game with patience and even got to resolve a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) or two, but it left Vieren with a handful of removal and card drawing spells that allowed him to eventually finishing the game with [Pearl Lake Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pearl+Lake+Ancient).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gppra15/gppra15_finals_vieren.jpg)  



“I drew a lot of removal after my first few threats, so I couldn't really get anywhere in the game,” Boussad explained before reaching for his sideboard.


“You can sideboard in your creatures now, I have no removal left in my deck,” he joked before the second game commenced.


“You can keep [Draconic Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draconic+Roar),” Vieren answered with a smile.


Boussad's plan for the second game would be to discard any counterspells from Vieren and try to resolve either a [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster) or an [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege) to get his own card drawing engine going. Or a quick Dragon to pressure Vieren's life total.


And things started out well for the Frenchman when [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) discarded [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity) and he could follow up with a [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker), seeing no removal in the Belgians hand. Mentally noting to play around the [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) he had seen in Vieren's hand.


Growing the [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) at the end of Vieren's next turn baited a [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), but left Boussad with two Thopter tokens, and the window to resolve [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster) if he could only find a fourth land on top of his deck.


He sadly didn't, and was forced to go for the plan of casting more discard spells, frowning when he saw [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang), [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity) and a [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve). He also added a second [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker), establishing quite the board presence against Vieren's removal light hand.


Vieren summoned [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang). But Boussad, even with just three lands in play, looked confidant when he attacked with his Thopters and cast a [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command), getting back his first [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) and discarding a card for Vieren.


The race was on, [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) against Thopters when Boussad resummoned his first [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker), but let out a sight of disbelief when Vieren cast [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity) at the end of his turn.


“That changes things,” he commented, knowing the game now was far from as over as it had looked the previous turn.


His [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker)-duo kept growing, but Vieren had [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) for a [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) and wrapped up Boussad's turn with a [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). Now pulling further and further back into the game, still at a healthy 14 life, being attacked only by Boussad's two Thopters for a few turns.


Boussad's next threat in [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster) was met by [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) and it looked like Vieren would be able to trade cards one for one before taking the game over with card drawing.


Between [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity), [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) and activating [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang), he did exactly that. [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death) also meant he didn't have to worry about neither a 3/3, a 4/4 [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) or any Thopter tokens on Boussad's side.


Boussad shook his head, and apologized for taking so long with his next decisions. Now trying desperately to find a line of plays to finish the game in his favor.


He summoned [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) and attacked along with his Thopters. Vieren blocked the Dragon and dropped to 12.


Vieren just drew and passed the turn. Surely Boussad's next turn would be the crucial one for the game, and the match if Vieren had enough answers for the Frenchman's board.


Boussad attacked with [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon), a 5/5 [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) and his two Thopter tokens. Vieren cast [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). Blocked Stormbreath with Silumgar and put his [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) in front of [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker).


A post combat [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) from Boussad was countered by [Psychic Rebuttal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Rebuttal), but with no Spell Mastery due to [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) emptying Vieren's graveyard.


Boussad was now faced with the dilemma of adding more to his board and being blown out by [Perilous Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Vault), or not having enough to win through two removal spells. He chose to just pass.


[Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) killed Boussad's entire team as even his 5/5 [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) fell to the ability of [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death). The Tokens however generated by the Hangarback blocked and killed Silumgar, and it looked like Boussad might be able to take the game after all.


[Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%27s+Fury) was countered by [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve), but Boussad's five tokens dropped Vieren to 5 life before a second [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) cleared the board.


[Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) was Boussad's next play. Met by another [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve), before a second Rabblemaster resolved. The token attacked Vieren down to 4. But he refueled with [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) at the end of turn.


[Silence the Believers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silence+the+Believers) handled [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) and the token, but [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) resolved and threatened lethal damage if it would get to attack. [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) ensured it wouldn't, but dropped Vieren to one life.


[Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) for Vieren's final [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) followed but [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) did the last point of damage, and Boussad was not yet out of his chance at the title.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gppra15/gppra15_finals_boussaud.jpg)  



“If you're hoping for a quick game, you might be disappointed,” Vieren told the spectators as the players shook hands before the beginning of the last and final game.


And the game was an instant reminder of the last. When first turn [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) discarded [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) and was followed by [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) for Eliott Boussad. Glad to only see [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) and [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) for removal in the Belgian's hand.


[Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) grew for a few turns, before it was joined by [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster), that fell to the [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price).


[Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) netted a [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) and [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) from Vieren, but Boussad also saw three copies of [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) in his hand and had to hope he could ride his [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) to victory before Vieren could start drawing insane amounts of cards.


Vieren Dug for answers and it looked like he would be in good shape if he could find any, as Boussad was stuck on three lands, and couldn't present a threat other than his aforementioned [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker).


[Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) got back [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) when Vieren tapped low for [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity) and Boussad's attack dropped the Belgian to 16.


[Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) again took out [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster), and [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) the [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker). Sensing that Vieren was holding a sweeper to handle the tokens, Boussad went for [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege) instead of more creatures. Surprising both spectators and coverage reporters alike by naming Dragons. With Vieren already at 11 from the tokens this might be the winning play, as Boussad felt unlikely to be able to keep up with multiple [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) with just one extra card per turn from the Khans mode on [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege).


A Belgian [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar) raised an eyebrow from Boussad, and stole a Thopter token before being taken out by a [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) from Boussad. Now dropping Vieran to six life.


[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) into [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) took out Boussad's army of Thopters, but left Vieren at a precarious two life and completely tapped out and dead if there was anything able to damage him in Boussad's hand.


Eliott Boussad drew for his turn. Thought for a while, and it was almost like he wanted to parade in the glory of the Grand Prix victory for a few seconds before wrapping the match up. With a million dollar-smile on his face he finally cast [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) and sent it through the air for the final points of damage, finally claiming the victory and his long sought after title as Grand Prix Champion.


**Eliott Boussad wins 2-1 against Peter Vieren**
