Hello from Berlin, Germany, and welcome to another edition of Building on a Budget. This week I am going to give you my take on Esper. I've always been a big fan of "Draw Go" strategies, and I was having trouble making an Esper deck that wasn't just another [Makeshift Mannequin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mannequin) deck. I decided to see if a traditional draw-go type of strategy could work in today's standard. I started working on the deck and remembered how much I enjoyed playing the archetype.

For those of you that aren't familiar with "Draw Go," it was initially a *Tempest*-era control deck that played a lot of counterspells, instant-speed card draw, and some type of inevitable win condition. The original draw go lists ran [Steel Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Golem), but [Steel Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Golem) isn't what it used to be. Nowadays [Steel Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Golem) would be getting [Flame Javelin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin)ed and [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God)ed off the board before it could ever go the distance. Draw Go upgraded to [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) a year or so later, a creature we don't have access to these days. For reference, here's Randy Buehler's Draw Go list from Worlds 1999 (6-0 in Standard).

60 Cards 




![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Faerie+Conclave)

















  
I wanted to use this list as a reference point when designing my new draw go deck. Cards like [Forbid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbid), [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), and [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) aren't really available anymore, but I can learn from this deck's curve. I want to make sure my curve matches Randy's as closely as it can with the cards available. Lets take a look at the original deck's curve.

![Whispers of the Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Whispers+of+the+Muse)**One:** [Whispers of the Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispers+of+the+Muse), [Faerie Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave) (I recognize this is a land, but lands that come into play tapped need to be counted as one-drops in a deck like this.)  
**Two:** [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Miscalculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Miscalculation), [Powder Keg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Powder+Keg)  
**Three:** [Forbid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbid)  
**Four:** [Dismiss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismiss), [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore)  
**Five:** [Treachery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery)

When I look at the available one-cost cards today, I'm pretty underwhelmed. I think the best one-cost cards available might be lands that come into play tapped. I will definitely be playing the full four [Arcane Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum), and I probably want a play set of [Faerie Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave)s to help me win the long game. I'll play [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn), but I don't think of a card I'll be playing on my fifth turn as a one-drop. I can consider playing some Vivid lands, but if I'm going to play 28 total lands in this blue-based deck, I can afford to splash black and white without giving up too much.

The original list had 13 cards that cost two mana. There isn't a good [Powder Keg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Powder+Keg) replacement in standard. I figured there might be some value in playing a better removal suite than the original deck and packing more card draw. I decided to play more removal, and I looked at the available two-cost cards.

**[Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw):** I love me some [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw), but I don't think it has a home in this deck. The fact that I can only evoke it on my turn is a bit of a problem for a Draw Go player.

**[Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror):** [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) is an extremely efficient way to deal with your opponent's threats. I'm not sure if it's worth playing four of them, but it does its job well. The problem with playing four of a card like [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) is that some of the most played creatures in today's Standard environment don't trade one for one with it. I hate using a card like [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) on my opponent's [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) or [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark). When an opponent plays a card like [Chameleon Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus) and I have a [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) in hand instead of a relevant card I will probably get pretty upset.

**[Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul):** [Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul) is an excellent two-mana counterspell. It got quite a bit of play in Faerie decks just prior to Pro Tour–Hollywood and it will probably be a four of in this deck. Most if not all decks will have targets for my [Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul)s. [Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul) really shines when you play it against decks like [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark).

**[Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate):** I talked a bit about [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) last week. At the end of that article I stated that I probably should have been running [Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul) instead. After a few more matches with the deck I realized that I was dead wrong when making this change. In a Standard environment full of five-color control decks, it's necessary to have a card like [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) in your maindeck.

**[Broken Ambitions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Ambitions):** It may not be a real two-drop, but [Broken Ambitions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Ambitions) is playable on our second turn, and it's important to have versatile counters that can be played early in the game.

Randy's 1999 Worlds list had a playset of [Forbid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbid) as his lonely three-drops. I scanned [Gatherer](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?) and looked at a few playable cards.

![Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jace+Beleren)**[Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren):** I think [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) is extremely underplayed. If you can resolve this in a control mirror, you can accrue huge amounts of card advantage over the course of the game. Games with Draw Go are likely to go very long if you're winning. A card like [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) lets you stay ahead once you're in the driver's seat. A lot of my friends have said things to me like, "[Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) seems like a win-more card." They think cards like Jace aren't necessary because a control deck that gets ahead will likely be winning the game regardless. I disagree, though. I've played a lot of games with control decks over the course of my life, and most of the games I lose to aggressive decks aren't lost on the fourth or fifth turn. A good control player can almost always get deep into a game by slowing down an opponent, but getting the lead and keeping it are very different things. I can clear my opponent's board and have [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) mana open when I'm at 4 life, but if my opponent has a pair of burn spells in hand, then it's likely that I won't be winning the game anyway. 

**[Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel):** A simple, elegant, efficiently costed counterspell, [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) is one of the best three cost options available to us.

**[Faerie Trickery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Trickery):** Once the dust settles with the new Standard format, this might become more playable. Right now it doesn't seem like the best plan. A lot of people are still playing Faeries. (And rightly so—Faeries remains, in my opinion, the most powerful deck in Standard.) Others are playing [Chameleon Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus), which also can't be countered with [Faerie Trickery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Trickery). Though I won't be playing [Faerie Trickery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Trickery), I thought it was worth mentioning because it could replace [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) in the coming weeks or months if the Standard environment oscillates in that direction.

**[Esper Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Charm):** Instant speed card draw. It's been a little while since I was able to tap some mana at the end of my opponent's turn and draw some cards. How much have I missed that? About four [Esper Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Charm)s worth. The other two clauses of [Esper Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Charm) are also relevant. Destroying [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom), [Runed Halo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Halo), or [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) seems nice. It also seems good to make my opponent discard their last two cards. I would aggressively make a control playing opponent discard if they're on the mulligan. Most control decks in today's Standard don't do much if they can't play their fifth land.

The four-drops in Randy's deck are probably too good to replace with modern era four-drop control cards. Unless my budget could support a helping of [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)s, I probably wouldn't play any four-drops in the modern incarnation of Draw Go. Luckily, I have a modern replacement for the [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore)s that were played in the original list. Unfortunately, my replacement costs five mana.

**[Razormane Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razormane+Masticore):** [Razormane Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razormane+Masticore) is amazing against aggressive decks, It can't be terrored, it fights with almost any creature, and it can attack into an opponent's [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher) if it's their only untapped creature. (Shoot your [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher) for 3, attack for 5, thanks!)



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Razormane Masticore | Persuasion |

[Treachery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery) is another card that can't be replaced easily. It's not the prettiest thing in the world, but [Persuasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion) is in [Tenth Edition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tenth+Edition) and, despite being a lot weaker for the archetype, it still results in two-for-ones most of the time.

After fiddling with the numbers a bit, I decided on the following:

4 [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn)  
 4 [Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul)  
 4 [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)  
 3 [Broken Ambitions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Ambitions)  
 3 [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)  
 4 [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel)  
 4 [Esper Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Charm)  
 2 [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren)  
 4 [Razormane Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razormane+Masticore)  
 2 [Persuasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion)

I'm only going to play 26 lands. (As opposed to the 28 in Randy's list.) I don't need as many lands as Randy because I'm not relying on cards like [Stalking Stones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones). After I play my sixth land I can start to stock a few in my hand. I can use these to discard to my [Razormane Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razormane+Masticore) or to bluff more counters than I actually have.

Here's the mana base:

4 [Faerie Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave)  
 4 [Arcane Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum)  
 5 [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains)  
 5 [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)  
 8 [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)

I wanted an alternate win condition in my sideboard for beating decks that will likely have a lot of dead cards if I take out my [Razormane Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razormane+Masticore). I decided [Millstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millstone) was a solid choice. Most decks that I would side in the [Millstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millstone) against would probably have [Makeshift Mannequin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mannequin)s, and [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) doesn't seem very relevant against them, so I can probably have some [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus) in my sideboard too. I still like infest even if this deck might not be able to reliably cast it. A deck like this will often get overrun by decks like Kithkin and it needs an effective tool to get back into the game. I can round out my sideboard with a little extra removal for decks with unusual threat choices. The sideboard I ended up playing looked like this.

3 [Millstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millstone)  
 4 [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus)  
 4 [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring)  
 4 [Infest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest)

Here's the final list.

### Match 1 vs. White Weenie

![Esper Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Esper+Charm)**Game 1:** I won the play. I'm pretty certain that going first is very important against the aggressive decks. I kept [Arcane Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum), [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul), [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror), [Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul), and [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate). I started with my [Arcane Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum) and my opponent played a [Windbrisk Heights](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windbrisk+Heights) and passed. I played an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and passed. The game just continued as one might expect from here. Every creature my opponent played got countered, and I even had the [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) for [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession). Eventually I drew a [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) when my opponent had nothing on the board, and I started gaining card advantage. I played a [Razormane Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razormane+Masticore) with a counter and [Esper Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Charm) on backup, and my opponent tried an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring). I let the [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) resolve. My opponent played a [Knight of Meadowgrain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Meadowgrain) and passed. I played [Esper Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Charm) to destroy his [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) at the end of turn. On my turn I discarded a land and destroyed his [Knight of Meadowgrain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Meadowgrain). I kept drawing cards with my planeswalker and shooting the creatures my opponent made. The game ended shortly thereafter.

I sided in four [Infest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest) and took out my [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel)s.

**Game 2:** I kept an opening hand with [Infest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest), [Infest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest), [Arcane Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum), [Arcane Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum), [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror), [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). My opponent led with a [Goldmeadow Stalwart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow+Stalwart) and showed me a [Knight of Meadowgrain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Meadowgrain). I played my [Arcane Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum) and passed. My opponent played [Knight of Meadowgrain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Meadowgrain) and attacked for 2. I played another [Arcane Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum) and passed. My opponent played a third [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), attacked for 4, and played a [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession). Nice draw. I untapped, played my [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and played [Infest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest). The game didn't progress much from there. Most turns my opponent just played a land and passed, and by the time my opponent started drawing gas again I had already drawn twice off [Esper Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Charm)s. A pair of [Faerie Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave) and a [Persuasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion)ed [Stillmoon Cavalier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stillmoon+Cavalier) went the distance.

1-0

**Match 2 vs. Five-Color Control**

![Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Relic+of+Progenitus)**Game 1:** I won the play again and kept [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), [Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul), [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Faerie Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave), and [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate). I played my [Faerie Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave) and passed. My opponent played a [Vivid Creek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivid+Creek) and passed. I played an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and passed, and then another [Vivid Creek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivid+Creek) from my opponent let me make my big play. [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) stuck, and I started drawing cards. My opponent didn't have a [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) for turn three, and I got to keep drawing. Whenever [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) had one loyalty counter I'd let us both draw. Then eventually I started attacking with a single Conclave. My opponent had a full grip, but I had a lot more action thanks to Jace. The inevitability of card advantage like that is really hard for another control deck to beat.

I sided out four [Razormane Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razormane+Masticore) and three [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn), and I brought in four Relic Of Progenitus (I saw [Makeshift Mannequin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mannequin)) and three [Millstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millstone).

**Game 2:** This game went similarly to the first. Nothing happened. Then I drew a [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) and played it with counter backup. My opponent managed to resolve a [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) on the next turn, but I had [Persuasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion) waiting. My opponent made another [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), and I made a [Millstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millstone) and a [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus) and passed. I kept milling and milled a [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher). At the end of my turn, my opponent went for a [Makeshift Mannequin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mannequin) on his 7/7. I activated the cantrip half of my [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus). My opponent responded with another [Makeshift Mannequin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mannequin), but I had a [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate). My opponent scooped it up with six cards left in his deck.

2-0

Normally I would play a few more matches with a deck, but I'm in Berlin, so this is no time to be inside playing **Magic**. I like decks like this a lot. It's probably not the best deck for competitive play, but it's a fun strategy if you like playing control decks, and I definitely recommend it for the casual room. Next week I may bring you a special budget Extended article. Wish me luck here in Berlin!
