**Changes in Awarding MOCS Promos**


For the 2015 *Magic Online* Championship Series (MOCS), we've made some changes to how players are awarded promo cards. While these changes aren't new—implemented at the beginning of the 2015 MOCS season—we wanted to call attention to them again for those who may have missed the update.


In previous years, we have granted a MOCS promo card to every player with 15 or more QPs. For the 2015 MOCS, we are expanding this. Now each player gets a MOCS Season promo card for every 15 Qualifier Points during a MOCS regular season. If you have 30 or more, you’ll get two. If you have 45 or more, you’ll get three, and so on. You also can still earn additional promo cards, as well as premium promo cards, by placing highly in Preliminaries and Finals.
