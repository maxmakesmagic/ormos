We step away from *[Ravnica](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/expansion/rav)* for a moment for a factoid from long ago.


The land of Jamuraa, the setting of the *Mirage* block, was ruled by three powerful nations: the militaristic Zhalfirins, the faithful Femeref, and the traders of the Suq'Ata empire -- each a splinter group of the Zhalfir kingdom that once dominated the entire continent.


Many elements of Zhalfirin culture show up in cards from the *Mirage* block ([Ancestral Memories](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Memories), [Bay Falcon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bay+Falcon), [Dread Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Specter), [Femeref Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Femeref+Archer), [Zhalfirin Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zhalfirin+Crusader)). It's clear that Zhalfirins ruled through a combination of religious zealotry and military might.


The *Visions* card [Triangle of War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triangle+of+War) represents a Zhalfirin symbol of war.


![Triangle of War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Triangle+of+War)*"The Zhalfirin war triangle represents a trinity of might, faith, and guile."*
That triangle symbol also inspired the *Visions* expansion symbol, conveniently shaped like the letter "V."

For more on the Zhalfirin triangle of war, check out the flavor text of [Zhalfirin Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zhalfirin+Knight) (which is a quote from "[The Love Song of Night and Day](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/145)"). And does the triangle also show up in the art of [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond)?
