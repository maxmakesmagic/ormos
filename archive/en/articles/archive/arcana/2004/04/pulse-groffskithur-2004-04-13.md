[Pulse of the Tangle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Tangle) creates 3/3 green Beast creature tokens. As it happens, there is only one 3/3 Beast in *Mirrodin* block: [Groffskithur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groffskithur). The creative team took this fact to suggest a way to illustrate the effect of [Pulse of the Tangle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Tangle):
> *"This spell represents wildlife triumphing even when the odds are against it. Show a badass forest creature, maybe a [Groffskithur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groffskithur), looking up through the tangle and seeing no sun overhead."*

The green Pulse's artist, Wayne England, took this advice to heart. Here's a blown-up image of *Mirrodin's* 
[Groffskithur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groffskithur) by artist John Matson, so you can see the characteristic look of a [Groffskithur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groffskithur):

And here's the art of Pulse of the Tangle. Note the recognizable curving horns, tentacley fingers and headdress, "shoulder chimneys," and the bullet-shaped nose.

Sometimes it's nice for a little-played common to end up illustrating a powerful rare.
