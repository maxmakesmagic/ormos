If you've ever seen an older (*Unlimited* or before) version of the dual-land [Plateau](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plateau), you probably noticed that the art used in those editions was different than that on the more plentiful *Revised* version.

The swap was not intentional. Between the printing of *Unlimited* and *Revised*, the computer file of the Drew Tucker art became corrupted and the original painting was lost, leaving the production team with no reasonable way to create a high-quality image. Luckily, art for dual-lands had been commissioned for the then-upcoming *Ice Age* set.

R&D eventually determined that dual-lands were too powerful to put into *Ice Age*, meaning the art wouldn't be needed for that set. So the Cornelius Brudi Plateau painting was then used as a stand-in for the original in the base set, and was actually misattributed to the original artist, Drew Tucker.
