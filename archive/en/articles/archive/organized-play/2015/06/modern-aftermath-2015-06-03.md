As I write this in a hotel room in Chiba, Japan, I can't help but look back on last weekend in awe. *Modern Masters* Weekend showcased hundreds of astounding stories from around the world, and it has only served to increase my love and respect for the *Magic* community.



We'll be continuing with highlight Arcana until tomorrow, and will be revisiting some of the coverage highlights of all three Grand Prix that took place last weekend next Monday. If you missed any of the coverage, I highly recommend you check out this week's Arcana for some photo essays and today's infographic. The numbers say a lot about the scope of last weekend, and the photos from our three *Modern Masters* Weekend photographers—Neale Talbot in Chiba, Craig Gibson in Utrecht, and Joey Pasco in Las Vegas—do a phenomenal job of giving you a glimpse of humanity that participated in last weekend's festivities.



But for now, let's take a look at a few things coming up in June.

Grand Prix
==========



While the Grand Prix circuit takes a much needed weekend off after Chiba, Utrecht, and Las Vegas, we're back into full swing next week.

First up is Grand Prix Charlotte, which is fittingly Modern following the three *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* Grand Prix. Charlotte also has a history of *Magic* Grand Prix, as the last Grand Prix Charlotte sported a few thousand dedicated *Magic* players. Grand Prix Charlotte runs from June 12–14.



The theming for this Grand Prix is based around [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch), one of the cards in *Modern Masters 2015 Edition*. In fact, all players who register for the main event receive this playmat featuring artwork of the Hierarch!

In addition to that, there are other opportunities to earn sweet [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) swag. Packs of [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) sleeves are available to select main event registrants based on the registration package they sign up for, and sleeves are also offered in select side events with entry or as prizes.

After Charlotte is the first of two double-Grand Prix weekends. On June 19–21, Grand Prix Copenhagen and Grand Prix Providence will take place. While Copenhagen's main event is Modern, Providence will be Standard.



All participants at Grand Prix Copenhagen also get a playmat that commemorates iconic Modern combo superstar [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker).

Everyone who registers for the Grand Prix Providence main event receives a playmat featuring Esper Dragons all-star removal [Foul-Tongue Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foul-Tongue+Invocation).

The month of June wraps up with two Grand Prix in two different continents June 26–28. Asia's Grand Prix will be in Singapore, while South America gets one in Buenos Aires. Singapore's main event is Modern, while Buenos Aires highlights Standard.



All participants who compete in the Grand Prix Singapore main event receive a playmat featuring the art of [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal).
