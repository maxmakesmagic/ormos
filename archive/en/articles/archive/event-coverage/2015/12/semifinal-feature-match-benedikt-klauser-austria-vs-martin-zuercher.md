![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPFLO00/189.jpg)I had the pleasure of covering Benedikt Klauser's match yet again today. Not surprisingly he is still playing Trix and he is still winning. 
 
Klauser is matched up against Martin Zuercher who was one the dozen players from Switzerland competing today. He made top 16 at 1999 GP Milan and came to GP Florence for the "top players and the prize money." He's "absolutely happy" with his top four as he only planned on making top 32. Zuercher was playing Trix as well.



**Game 1**


90% of the time whoever casts Necropotence first wins. However, this game was one of the other ten percent. 



After Zuercher cast both Necropotence and Illusions of Grandeur he had to stop and think. He had only one card left in his library, which he knew was Donate, and a Donate in hand waiting to be cast. You're probably thinking, "what's the problem?" Well, Zuercher had failed to set aside sufficient land and consequently couldn't afford to pay the upkeep on the Illusions and cast Donate. That was the end of game one in Klauser's favour.



**Game 2**


Klauser played a first turn Vampiric Tutor and followed up with a second turn Mox Diamond and Phyrexian Negator. Zuercher Demonic Consultationed for land and followed up with his own Negator.



Klauser played another Negator and attacked with the first putting life totals at 8 - 11 in Klauser's favour. Klauser Necroed for three and it was then Zuercher's turn.



Zuercher attacked with his Negator that was blocked by Klauser's. Before damage went on the stack Zuercher Firestormed for four, discarding his entire hand. Klauser Force of Willed it and Zuercher was left with nothing in front of him and nothing in hand. In comparison to Klauser's Negator, Mox Diamond, and Swamp on the board with three cards in hand. Zuercher conceded knowing it was over next turn.



**Final Result:** Benedikt Klauser, 2-0
