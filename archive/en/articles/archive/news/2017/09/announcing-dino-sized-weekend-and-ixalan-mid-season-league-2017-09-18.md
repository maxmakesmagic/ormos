Two special events are coming to [stores around the world](http://locator.wizards.com/), with prizes and formats you won't want to miss!


Dino-Sized Weekend
==================


The weekend of October 28â€“29, stores around the world will be able to celebrate the world of Ixalan by hosting six-pack Sealed events, three-pack Draft events, and very special dino-sized Draft events using four packs of *Ixalan* instead of three!


These events will have very special prizes: mini-posters featuring never-before-seen Ixalan-inspired art! The artwork for the posters will be revealed soon, so check with your local store to find out how you can get your hands on one.


*Ixalan* Mid-Season League
==========================


Running November 6 through December 3, stores can run *Ixalan* Mid-Season Leagues. This League will follow the same format as previous Leagues, allowing you to build a 30-card deck from three *Ixalan* booster packs. Players can add a new pack each week for the duration of the League, as well as an additional pack after three losses.


Players who complete ten matches can claim a premium foil Unclaimed Territory promo card for themselves!
