Last weekend featured two big Grand Prix. The first was in Shizuoka, Japan, where many of Japan's best (along with an impressive collection of globetrotters!) competed in the last *Khans of Tarkir* Limited GP before *Fate Reforged* gets added into the mix. Akito Shinoda overcame Japanese platinum superstar Yuuki Ichikawa, as well as China's Sun Bo, in order to claim victory.



Meanwhile, Modern was the format in Grand Prix Omaha as players competed in North America's first Modern event since the release of *Khans of Tarkir*. The new set has made a huge impact on the format. It wasn't [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) that took the top honors, but rather [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), as Erik Peters defeated a difficult field with his Abzan Pod deck, sporting no insidious combos and plenty of valuable creatures as the "fairest" [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) deck of the bunch.



Meanwhile, the Pro Tour Qualifier season that is awarding invitations and travel to [Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/qualifiers-pro-tour-dragons-of-tarkir) continues. The format for this season is Standard, so be sure to [find a PTQ near you,](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/qualifierlist) and hopefully we'll see you in Brussels, Belgium April 10—12!
