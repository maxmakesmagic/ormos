October 1, 2014
 










A new weekend approaches, and with it, two Grand Prix as well as a couple of other GP updates!


October is chock-full of *Magic,* starting this weekend with the first two Grand Prix to feature *Khans of Tarkir* Limited action.


First up is Grand Prix Shanghai. Many of the Asia region's top players will be getting their first true *Khans of Tarkir* Limited experience in Shanghai, China. You can follow coverage of the event this weekend from *Magic* coverage reporter Chapman Sim if you're not attending.


Of course, if you aren't attending, then you probably aren't getting one of these bad boys, sporting some incredible artwork from Aleksi Briclot.

*Participants in the Grand Prix Shanghai main event will receive a very panda-rific playmat. Playmats are only available on a first-come, first-serve basis for GP main event competitors who check in on Friday.*
The artist behind the playmat, [Aleksi Briclot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[%22Aleksi+Briclot%22]), will also be at GP Shanghai, so anyone who picks up this sweet exclusive can also get it signed during the weekend!


Shanghai will also be the same weekend as Grand Prix Orlando, hosted by [StarCityGames.com](http://www.starcitygames.com/). While Orlando's GP exclusives may feature fewer pandas, they do feature a lot of cool nods to the theme-park nature of the city.

*All participants at Grand Prix Orlando will receive this event-exclusive playmat.*
Aside from receiving the playmat, featuring the a theme park map of the Dominaria Resort, all participants in the Grand Prix Orlando main event will get a pin of The Timetwister, the fictional roller coaster of the Dominaria Resort and a hat-tip to the Power Nine classic, Timetwister.

In addition to that, attendees at Grand Prix Orlando can also collect five other pins featuring attractions from the Dominaria Resort: the Chaos Orbiter, the Phlying Phelddagrifs, the Squirrel Wrangler Stunt Spectacular, the Ferris Wheel of Fortune, and the Command Tower of Horror.

You can find more details on how to earn these pins at the [GP Orlando web site](http://www.magicgp.com/GPOrlando/index.html).


GP Orlando will be taking place at the [Orange County Convention Center](http://www.occc.net/). If you're flying in for the weekend, the convention center is about 13 miles away from the Orlando International Airport. Plan accordingly.


Aside from the Grand Prix, if you've got some extra days to spend in Orlando, the event venue is smack-dab in the middle of many of Orlando's theme park attractions. Not far from the GP site is Seaworld, as well as Universal Studios, both offering a wide variety of exhibits, rides, and more.


For many coming in from Europe, GP Orlando is a convenient stop on the way to Honolulu for Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, and more than a few notable players who aren't already testing in Honolulu will be there this weekend!


If you can't join everyone in Orlando for all the fun and excitement, you can follow along at home. Video coverage will be brought to you by SCGLive this weekend, and reporters Adam Styborski as well as the legendary Rich Hagon will be bringing you the latest stories from the tournament floor.


After this week's Premier Play sampling of *Khans of Tarkir* Limited, I'll be saying aloha to you on Wednesday while on a plane to Honolulu, where the top players from all over the world—including what may be one of the greatest gatherings of Hall of Fame players—will be competing to win the first Pro Tour of the 2014–2015 Premier Play season.


You can catch the trailer for Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* below.

A total of $250,000 is up for grabs next week, and the game's top players will all be competing for that, along with the glory, prestige, and more that comes with a win. You won't want to miss it!



After that? Grand Prix Los Angeles.


After that? Grand Prix Stockholm.


And after that? Grand Prix Nashville and Grand Prix Santiago running back-to-back.


It's going to be a busy month.


Looking even further ahead, the playmat for Grand Prix Baltimore, taking place December 12–14, has been revealed.

*Select participants at GP Baltimore this year will receive an event-exclusive playmat featuring the art from Sagu Mauler!*
*Magic* in 2014 sure isn't slowing down, and October is a month of coverage and more that you won't want to miss.
