**Nathan Holiday (Melira Pod) vs. Andrew Huska (Jund)**


The first game of this match opened like you would expect in this matchup. Huska's Jund deck looked to control the early board and disrupt Holiday's Pod deck as much as he could in the early turns of the game. A [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) stripped a [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) over a [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), [Ranger of Eos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos), and [Linvala, Keeper of Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+Keeper+of+Silence). He followed that up with a [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), which provided him a steady stream of removal spells in the form of two [Slaughter Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact)s, an [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), and a [Scavenging Ooze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze). Holiday's first-turn [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) allowed him to ramp into an early Linvala, but it met an early demise at the hands of [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate).


"I actually don't want to Pact yet," Huska explained.

*Nathan Holiday*

He then began his assault, sending a [Scavenging Ooze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) and [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) to the red zone over and over again. Holiday tried to stem the tide with [Ranger of Eos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos) and [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), but Huska's stream of removal and [Scavenging Ooze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) really ended matters quickly. Holiday never once saw a [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), and, as a result, just lost to the better creature deck.


"That was a clinic on how this matchup is not supposed to go," Holiday allowed himself a little laugh at the end of the game.


In the next game, Holiday was forced to mulligan, but his hand was pretty good for a six-carder. [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) enabled an early [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), and it began turning his creatures into other, better creatures. [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) became [Sin Collector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sin+Collector), stripping [Rakdos Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Charm) from Huska's hand. When Holiday topdecked a [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) a turn later, it turned that into [Murder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murder)ous Recap, taking out Huska's freshly-cast [Scavenging Ooze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze). Huska was able to rip a [Maelstrom Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) to get rid of the Pod, but the damage was done. Between the creatures that were already in play and the ones in his hand, Holiday was in complete control of the game despite his mulligan. The final shot was fired by a [Shriekmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw), which Holiday cast to get rid of Huska's lone [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf).

*Andrew Huska*

The final game was marred by a string of mulligans by Holiday, ending up with five cards in his hand. When Huska had an [Anger of the Gods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods) to wipe his board followed by a [Thrun, the Last Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll), dying to a [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil), the match was sealed. It took one lone [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) for Huska to get the job done.


**Gregory Orange (WUR Control) vs. Taylor Laehn (TarmoTwin)**


This match was long and tedious, but ended with a flash of brilliance. In the first game, Laehn's TarmoTwin deck and Orange's WUR Control deck traded turns playing lands and tossing the occasional Lighting Bolt or [Electrolyze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze) at each other's heads. Any time that Laehn tried to get a [Pestermite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) into play, Orange had the [Electrolyze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze) to kill it and hit Laehn for 1. After about ten turns of this apiece, things blew up with a massive end step stack.


Late in the game, with Orange down to 5, Laehn went for the kill, casting a [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). With the trigger on the stack, Orange [Electrolyze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze)d it, but Laehn had a second Snapcaster in his hand in response. The second one got [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed, which Laehn tapped out to pay for. This gave Orange a free window to cast [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for eight, going up to a much safer 13 life and a hand filled with cards. This, in turn, let Laehn have a free turn. If he had the combo in his hand, the game was over. If he didn't, Orange would come out the extreme winner in the exchange. It turned out he didn't and Orange just took over. From that point, Orange's extreme card advantage allowed him to run Laehn out of cards, eventually winning one more massive fight over a [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) before Laehn conceded.

*Gregory Orange*

"I'll give you the game," he laughed after the insane stack resolved in Orange's favor. "You got me."


For the second game, Laehn made the unorthodox decision to draw in this heavy control matchup. Unfortunately for him, Orange had a trump card in this matchup, and it wasn't one I expected: [Crucible of Worlds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+Worlds). It hit play on turn three, allowing Orange to effectively keep Laehn locked down on lands, constantly recurring a [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to kill a land. Whenever he had the chance, he would use it to recur an [Arid Mesa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa), furthering his own mana base. Eventually, Laehn managed to get enough basic lands into play to cast a [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), but Orange had enough control of the game to keep it from attacking. [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) and a [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) made sure it stayed unequipped, despite Laehn's efforts, returning and recasting it. It was almost [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed, but Laehn had the [Spell Snare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) to force it back into play.

*Taylor Laehn*

Orange almost managed to lock the game up with a massive [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), but a [Dispel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) stopped it. This almost allowed Laehn to take control of the game. He had a [Threads of Disloyalty](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty) and a [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) to threaten lethal damage, as the constant fetching and occasional [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) had Orange down to 7. Unfortunately for Laehn, it also allowed him enough lands to begin attacking with his [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade). He Bolted his own traitorous Mage, neutering Laehn's attack. One more swing with the Colonnade and an [Electrolyze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze) later, and Orange had secured himself a spot in the semifinals.
