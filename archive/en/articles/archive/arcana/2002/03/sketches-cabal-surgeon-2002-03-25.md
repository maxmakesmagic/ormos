Today's card is *Torment*'s [Cabal Surgeon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Surgeon), by Donato Giancola. Donato is famous for his book covers as well as his **Magic** illustrations.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This card should show a cabal healer who is patching together dead body parts to make one being. This is a serious piece but please do not get real gross with this one."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Donato; the card was originally called "Cabal Healer." Donato did a fine job of making the image creepy without being gross. The **Magic** Brand team were concerned that the surgical lamp looked too modern, so they specifically asked Donato to change the look of it..

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final painting. Note that the lamp has been changed.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today. The art was too wide to fit, so a little of the "patient's" legs was cropped off.
