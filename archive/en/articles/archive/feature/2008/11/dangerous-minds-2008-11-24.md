The following members of Wizards of the Coast's Research and Development team worked hand-in-hand on the *Tempest* expansion. Here's a look at who they are and what makes them tick (*in alphabetical order*).

### Charlie Catino


> *"Charlie doesn't want cards that are gonna cause trouble. He signals his displeasure by crushing them with his softball bat." -Richard Garfield*

![Charlie Catino](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/14b_catino.jpg)**Age:** 31

**Education:** University of Pennsylvania, '88, Biology

**Began working at Wizards:** February '95

**Job responsibilities:** "Play games."

**Other expansions worked on:** "I playtested original **Magic** and *Ice Age*, helped develop *Homelands* and *Alliances*, helped design *Visions*, and helped design and develop *Mirage*."

**Favorite expansion set of all time:** "*Alliances*, because I was so thoroughly involved in development and playtesting, and there were so many interesting (read: ba-roken) cards with which to build decks and play."

**Three favorite cards in *Tempest*:**


* Dismiss: "Who in the world wouldn't want to stop an opponent from playing a spell and draw a card to boot?"
* Mana Severance: "It's got to be broken."
* X4B: "It's a spell so good you can just call it by its casting cost."

**Best aspect of working on an expansion:** Arguing.

### Mike Elliott


> *"Mike's mysterious and unpredictable, yet strangely familiar. Cold and calculating, yet not without a heart." -Richard Garfield*

![Mike Elliott](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/14b_elliott.jpg)**Age:** 35

**Education:** California Polytechnic Institute, '86, Biology

**Began working at Wizards:** January '96

**Job responsibilities:** "Design and development, and project manager for **Magic**." Other expansions worked on: *Alliances*, *Mirage*, *Visions*, *Portal*, *Weatherlight*, *Fifth Edition*, and *Vanguard*.

**Favorite expansion set of all time:** "*Tempest*, though I'm probably a little biased since I did a lot of design work on this project."

**Three favorite cards in *Tempest*:**


* Living Death: "It's a fun combo card that interacts with sacrificial creatures."
* Aluren: "I like alternate casting-cost mechanisms."
* Fool's Tome: "Another good combo card."

**Best aspect of working on an expansion:** "Designing new cards and seeing how the players react to them once they're printed."

### Richard Garfield


> *"Watching Richard design is like watching a magic act. Amazing things appear and you wonder where they came from." -Mark Rosewater*

![Richard Garfield](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/14b_garfield.jpg)**Age:** 34

**Education:** University of Pennsylvania, '93, Ph.D. Mathematics (combinatorics)

**Began working at Wizards:** From the beginning

**Job responsibilities:** "New game development, R&amp;D vision."

**Other expansions worked on:**
*Arabian Nights*. **Favorite expansion set of all time:** "*Alliances*. I consider this expansion the first 'modern' expansion. It was loaded with good ideas and got all the elements of a good expansion correct." **Three favorite cards in *Tempest*:**


* Unstable Shapeshifter: "A cool combination card with some weird possibilities."
* Ertai's Meddling: "I've wanted a time-delay effect of this sort for a while. This card reeks of amusing situations."
* Marble Titan: "I like the humor of this card."

**Best aspect of working on an expansion:** "Every time I play **Magic** and wish I could do something [different] but can't, I make a mental note. Working on an expansion allows me to clear that mental notebook."

### William Jockusch


> *"William is a cross between Sleepy and Einstein." -Bill Rose*

![William Jockush](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/14b_jockush.jpg)**Age:** 30

**Education:** Carleton College, '88, Math

**Began working at Wizards:** October '95

**Job responsibilities:** "Create card text for **Magic** expansions; discover as many 'broken' cards as I can before they go to print."

**Other expansions worked on:**
*Alliances*, *Mirage*, *Visions*, *Portal*, *Weatherlight*, *Fifth Edition*, and *Vanguard*.

**Favorite expansion set of all time:** "*Ice Age*, because it introduced cantrips, which represent the best new concept that's been added to the game."

**Three favorite cards in *Tempest*:**


* Whispers of the Muse: "Because all **Magic** players think it's a weak card-and they're all wrong."
* Hero's Resolve: "Because it shows there may yet be hope for creature enhancements."
* Winds of Rath: "See Hero's Resolve."

**Best aspect of working on an expansion:** "Building a deck with some broken card, then beating on the card's designer with it."

### Bill Rose


> *"If Bill can't get what he wants one way, he'll get it another way." -William Jockusch*

![Bill Rose](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/14b_rose.jpg)**Age:** 35

**Education:** University of Pennsylvania, '86, Economics

**Began working at Wizards:** October '95

**Job responsibilities:** "Sometimes an expansion lead designer and developer; sometimes just an R&D grunt."

**Other expansions worked on:** "Alpha-I was one of the original playtesters. I also playtested *Ice Age*, and was on the Development team for *Alliances*. I was the lead designer and lead developer for *Mirage*, *Visions*, and *Portal*. I've also worked on *Weatherlight*, and *Fifth Edition*."

**Favorite expansion set of all time:** "Code name: *Power Lunch*. It hasn't been published yet, but Juzam would get its butt kicked in *Power Lunch*. The experimental *Power Lunch* is being designed for one player to take on two opponents working as a team."

**Three favorite cards in *Tempest*:**


* Dismiss: "My two favorite things are drawing cards and countering spells."
* Dregs of Sorrow: "The next best thing is killing the creatures I couldn't counter and drawing cards."
* Avenging Angel: "The card most likely to drive my opponent mad."

**Best aspect of working on an expansion:** "Taking a jumbled collection of cards and ideas, and turning them all into *Mirage* or *Tempest*."

### Mark Rosewater


> *"Getting an idea from Mark is like trying to take a drink from a firehose." -Richard Garfield*

**Three favorite cards in *Tempest*:**


* Scragnoth: "I dreamed up the idea of an uncounterable creature three years ago and have been dying to see it make it into the game."
* Duplicity: "Another wacky idea that gnawed at me for more than a year."
* Recycle: "I love cards that have the potential to spawn weird deck types."

**Best aspect of working on an expansion:** "Seeing the audience's response when the set finally comes out."

### Henry Stern


> *"If it's not a Type II card, Henry couldn't care less about it. -Bill Rose*

### Tom Wylie

**Best aspect of working on an expansion:** "Not actually being involved in design or development leaves me plenty of time for games I'd rather be working on."
