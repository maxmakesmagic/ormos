Welcome to our weekly look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. With no premier events to shift things last weekend, our Top 25 remains unaltered. But the weekend to come looks likely to change that in a big way. It's rare for there to be three Grand Prix on the same weekend. For all three to be in the exact same format is extraordinary. With the end of the season rapidly approaching at Pro Tour *Magic Origins*, each weekend is becoming increasingly important for those pros trying to chase down Gold, Platinum, or even Player of the Year status for next season.



By far the biggest offering this weekend comes in Las Vegas, where over 7,000 players are already committed to a day of *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* Sealed Deck, followed by (for the dwindling crowd that should still be in the many hundreds) Draft on Day Two. Right now, sixteen of our Top 25 hail from the United States (13) or Canada (3), and we anticipate almost all of them taking their chance on the Las Vegas starting line come Saturday morning.



Over in Chiba, just outside Tokyo in Japan, we can expect to see the likes of No. 3 Lee Shi Tian, No. 5 Yuuya Watanabe, No. 18 Shota Yasooka, and No. 21 Yuuki Ichikawa all in action. Lee Shi Tian has led the Player of the Year race for much of the season, and the jockeying for position down the stretch will be fierce. Chiba has been a 4,000-player sellout since the very first day of registration, so anyone who comes out of the melee near the top of the standings can be proud of the achievement.



The field in Utrecht, Netherlands, is currently heading toward 3,500, and represents the largest cultural melting pot of the three venues. No. 9 Ivan Floch, No. 17 Ondrej Strasky, and No. 24 Antonio Del Moral León spearhead the ranking challenge in Utrecht. Del Moral León is the most visible sign of Spain on the rise at the moment, but there have been an increasing number of Spanish players in the thick of the action down the stretch at recent European Grand Prix. Watch for them to do well again this weekend.



So, three tournaments, three continents, one *Modern Masters 2015 Edition*, and 25 ranking slots up for grabs. To see how it all shakes out, join us again next week for another look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
