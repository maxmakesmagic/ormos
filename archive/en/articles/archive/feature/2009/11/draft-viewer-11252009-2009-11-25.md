Welcome back to the Draft Viewer! How about something from last weekend's [World Championships](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/coverage-2009-world-championships-2009-11-12)? This is Table 1 of the second draft, featuring Bram Snepvangers, Shota Yasooka, Petr Brozek, Alexey Antonenko, Seraj Haroun, Marijn Lybaert, Tomoharu Saito, and Robert Jurkovic. Two of the eventual Top 8 would come out of this draft, which featured players who were all at either 8-1 or (in the case of Lybaert) 9-0. This is truly the big time when it comes to triple-*Zendikar* draft!

Complete coverage of the Worlds [is here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/coverage-2009-world-championships-2009-11-12). And we've got detailed coverage of the [Round 10 Yasooka-Snepvangers](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/worlds-2009-round-10-doing-math-2009-11-20) match and the [Round 12 Lybaert-Snepvangers](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/worlds-2009-round-12-between-maw-and-hallowed-place-2009-11-20) match for your further edification.
