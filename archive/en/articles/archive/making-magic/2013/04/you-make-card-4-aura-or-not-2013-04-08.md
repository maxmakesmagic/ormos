Welcome back to You Make the Card, where you, the **Magic**-playing public, get to be part of a giant design team, led by yours truly. Our mission: to design a really cool **Magic** card. Last week, we decided that our enchantment should be a black card. This week, we need to make an important decision about how our card will work.


The results of the last vote are in. Black is the winner!




| **Poll #3 Card Color**  |
| --- |
| Black | 18552 | 31.1% |
| Red | 16105 | 27.0% |
| Green | 9299 | 15.6% |
| Blue | 8052 | 13.5% |
| White | 7648 | 12.8% |
| **Total** | **59656** | **100.0%** |

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feat242c_card.jpg)We have two general types of enchantments, Auras and what we've nicknamed "global enchantment." Technically these are called "non-Aura enchantments" in the **Magic** rulebook, but that's a pretty ugly string of words, in my opinion, so we'll use the phrase "global enchantments" for the purposes of this article.


Global enchantments tend to have an ability that affects the whole game, changing the rules while they're on the battlefield. They can be potent combo engines, oppressive disruptive elements, or ways to improve your whole army of creatures.


Auras are more localized in their effects. These enchantments attach to things, usually other permanents, but sometimes to other things such as players. They stick around and provide a bonus or penalty to the thing they're enchanting.
