Nine rounds, no byes: That's the march to become undefeated in Team Limited on Day 1 of a Grand Prix. Massaging mana, managing morphs, and making all the right calls – including whether you listen to your teammates or not – is a challenge few can follow through on.


Going into the ultimate round of Day 1 at Grand Prix Nashville just three teams were fighting for that glory:


* With the only 8-0 record as a team, the trio of Matthew Sommerhalter, Dewitt Kane, and Riley Curran
* Bob Baker, Brian Kowal, and Mike Heup at 7-0-1
* And also at 7-0-1 Brent Gregath, Matthew Boccio, and Tillman Bragg

While two of these teams sat atop the standings for a showdown, it's at Table 2 that an interesting story unfolded.



**Table 2: The Heist**




 Gregath, Boccio, and Bragg, in their fight for undefeated, were paired down to a few players you may already know: Pro Tour *Gatecrash* winner and 18th-ranked Tom Martell, Pro Tour Hall of Fame member Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, and 2013 World Champion and 20th-ranked Shahar Shenhar. With plenty of Pro Tour and Grand Prix performances (And wins!) under their belts, the trio was in a position to steal away the undefeated spotlight from the underdogs.




 Martell and Gregath clashed in a Mardu mirror. In two quick games, Martell took over the battlefield and put his Sealed powerhouse [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) to work claiming the victory.




 In the middle seats, Damo da Rosa and Boccio had longer games. The Brazilian Hall of Famer had planted a Jeskai deck, but it bore no fruit against Boccio's Temur deck: In two games Boccio outmaneuvered the all star, using a [Barrage of Boulders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrage+of+Boulders) to pummel the smaller creatures Damo da Rosa had cast to claim the win.






*Brent Gregath, Matthew Boccio, and Tillman Bragg were in a tough spot against even tougher opponents.*
