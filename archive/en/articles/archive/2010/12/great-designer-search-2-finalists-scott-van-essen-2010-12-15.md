### Commentary:


Commons - I chose sorceries because instants make Requiem too easy to use. Also, sorceries encourage attacking, add thought to your opponent's blocking decisions, and encourage bluffing. Instants are more interactive on a micro-level, but on a macro level, you're more likely to hold back creatures and cast the spells after blocking, making your opponent more reticent to attack, and decreasing overall interactivity.


Uncommons - Given the high lethality of Wodotha, I wanted my Auras to have built in protection against card disadvantage. I also wanted to reuse the extra graveyard (and enters the battlefield) triggers a set based around death has.


Mythics - My Mythic concept was "Each color's ultimate representative for dealing with the onset of the blight". White escapes it; Blue passes knowledge beyond it; Black embraces it; Red says "screw it, let's get wild"; Green endures. This cycle took many iterations, some "do-nothing", some BAHroken. The dual "enters the battlefield" and graveyard triggers solved the problem in multiple ways. The Black and Red cards needed to blight at least twice so that the ability is relevant outside the bio-dome. They all need an early trigger so they aren't just big bodies when you play them; and a late trigger so that they feel like they're "carrying on beyond the Blight". Overall, they felt like haymakers without being knockout blows, and combos they made were slow, fun, and escapable. Additionally, the Blue and Green Mythics play into the milling sub-theme Shawn has set up.
