Sam had to take a mulligan to start, and apparently kept a rather weak hand. He did play Faith's Feathers on Antoine's [Nullmage Shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nullmage+Shepherd), but that didn't prevent him to convoke a turn five Siege-Wurm. Sam tried to race with [Agrus Kos, Wojek Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agrus+Kos%2C+Wojek+Veteran), but eventually was forced to block the Wurm with Agrus and a [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder). Antoine had a [Darkblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast), and Sam conceded.


1-0, Antoine.


Game 2 went a lot better for Sam: By turn four, he had a [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) and a [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch), while Antoine was stuck on three lands and busy discarding. The only spell Antoine played in that game was a [Darkblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast), whose effect on the Hierarch is extremely limited.


1-1

Antoine chose to go first in Game 3, and used [Farseek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) to accelerate to three mana. However, he didn't have another land, and was forced to use his third turn playing a [Dimir Infiltrator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Infiltrator). Meanwhile, Sam was generating lots of power with [Centaur Safeguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Safeguard), [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) and [Selesnya Sagittars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Sagittars). Antoine found some extra lands, and was able to hold back Sam and generate an attack force of his own. [Snapping Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake), [Golgari Rotwurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Rotwurm) and [Siege Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Wurm) were the main actors on his side. They would soon be degraded to supporting actors though, as Antoine used them and a [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) to convoke out the [Sisters of Stone Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sisters+of+Stone+Death). The Sisters cleared Sam's side of the table, and Antoine's army had no one to stop them from winning the game for him.


Antoine won, 2-1, and was still undefeated
