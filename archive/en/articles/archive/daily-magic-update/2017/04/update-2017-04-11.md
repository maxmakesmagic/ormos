The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 11, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [cycles of cycling cards](#3).


Today's Previews
================


Every day until the full set is revealed on April 14, I'll be sharing all the non-DailyMTG previews you can find around the web in this space. Here are today's:


1. [Exclusive First Look at *Magic: The Gathering Amonkhet*](http://ew.com/books/exclusive-first-look-at-magic-the-gathering-amonkhet/) | *Entertainment Weekly* | Nivea Serrao

This is a little different, and not just because we've not really been an *Entertainment Weekly* mainstay, but because it's presented in slideshow form. Check out several preview cards plus some flavor in the form of art and lore from the pages of the *Amonkhet* art book.


1. [Heaven /// Earth](https://www.enndalgames.com/user_data/Amonkhet_Preview.php?view=pc) | Enndalgames.com

I'm not even going to pretend to understand what this page even says, but if you click the blue link near the top, it will reveal the card in Japanese. The translation is relatively straightforward, and you can see [a strong translation here](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/64oqzd/akh_new_japanese_aftermath_card_can_someone/dg3v2bc/).


1. [Exclusive LR Preview Cards for *Amonkhet*!](http://lrcast.com/exclusive-lr-preview-cards-for-amonkhet/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

A cycle of cycling cards makes me happy for word aesthetics alone. I'm going to be using that one a lot to describe these cards. "Oh, did you know [Renewed Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith) was part of a cycle of cycling cards?"


I apologize in advance.

While a leak pushed this one up for Magic Mics, still tune in tomorrow evening on [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics) at 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT/3 a.m. UTC for the *Invocation* version and for more preview cards.


1. [Wizards of the Coast Tumblr](http://wizardsmagic.tumblr.com/) | **Coming Soon**

If you're not following our Tumblr, you're missing all the cool card art, fan art, and, today at least, preview cards we post there. If you need more incentives, there are pictures of cats.


1. [Wizards Account System Email](https://accounts.wizards.com/) | **Coming Soon**

So, if you have a Wizards Account *and* you've opted to receive emails, you should be receiving one such email today with an exclusive preview card. Fake internet points for posting it first not included.


1. [Aether Hub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz9Bzv3qCbw) | Seibenlore

It seems fitting that a YouTube channel all (mostly) about *Magic*'s story would receive the third story spotlight card, yes?


Look for the fourth and fifth story spotlight cards tomorrow and Thursday.


1. Also coming from the future

While they're scheduled for tomorrow, keep an eye on the [*Magic: The Gathering* Asia-Pacific Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering.apac/) page and tokyomtg.com, as that part of the world lives in the future and they could potentially drop later "today." Except it's tomorrow over there. Time is weird.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [How to Play *Magic: The Gathering*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCQGSTUZAds) | Windmill Slam | Denis Stranjak

Can you learn to play *Magic* in under 7 minutes? Stranjak's certainly going to try to teach you in this short video with the crew from Windmill Slam.

Synergy of the Day
==================


1. It's Madness!

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_CauMBC9mh1.png)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Noose+Constrictor)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noose+Constrictor) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fiery+Temper)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Incorrigible+Youths)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incorrigible+Youths)
Back when madness first debuted with *Odyssey*, there were a number of decks built around [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and the ability to discard cards with flashback, like [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm), or cards with madness, like [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm). The deck could hit hard and fast and leveraged the lower costs of these cards when they were discarded.


Fast forward to today, and many of the same parts are present. [Noose Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noose+Constrictor) steps in for [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). [Incorrigible Youths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incorrigible+Youths) does a decent [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) impression, [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper) is, well, still [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper), and Honored Hydra is basically just an updated [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm).


Who knows if we can actually make it work, but the pieces are clearly there to start something brewing.
