TAMIYO
======



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on September 18, 2013 










When the field scholar Tamiyo became a Planeswalker, the potential knowledge of the Multiverse was greater than any power she could ever desire. A blue mage, she doesn’t use brute force to get what she wants, but rather knowledge, defense, persistence, and the mind.


Her moonfolk, the soratami of Kamigawa, are a secretive and inquisitive race. Their knowledge of the metaphysical forces on their world is unparalleled. As a Planeswalker, Tamiyo sees each new plane is an unexplored treasure trove of knowledge to be brought back to her people’s great scroll towers.


Tamiyo is particularly enamored with the mysteries of Innistrad and its silver moon. Observing them for many cycles, she’s carefully charted the forces at work here, including the moon's influence on the lycanthropic curse and the ebb and flow of the vampire frenzies.


Her curiosity eventually led her to the door of the famed astronomancer Jenrik, where she spent months poring over his countless charts and adding her own observations.


Later, when Innistrad’s guardian angel finally returned to the realm, Tamiyo wrote extensive theories about the angel's effects on the land, its creatures, and its moon. The nature of the Helvault, the creation of the wolfir, the appearance of the gryffs, and the origins of the newly empowered holy wards are all filling her scrolls with more questions than she has answers.
