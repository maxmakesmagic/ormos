Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






I received a lot of positive feedback for [my column on Standard infect](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/all-fect-redux-2011-05-11) with *New Phyrexia* last week. This week, I'd like to discuss another overlooked card from *New Phyrexia*. [Fresh Meat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fresh+Meat) is card that got a bit of attention when it was originally revealed, but the hype seems to have died down.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab143_fresh.jpg)  
This week, I'd like to build a deck that gets maximum value out of the *New Phyrexia* instant. I began by researching cards with similar effects. [Caller of the Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caller+of+the+Claw) seemed like a close enough match. Older deck lists with [Caller of the Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caller+of+the+Claw) usually used the card in beatdown strategies as a precaution against [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God)–style sweepers. The card was common in sideboards, but was often included as a singleton in decks that had the ability to tutor it up.

| Fresh Meat | Caller of the Claw |

That wasn't quite what I was looking for, though. I can't build a deck around a sideboard card, and it doesn't even seem like a good sideboard card in modern beatdown decks. Leaving four mana open is a difficult task, and most decks that would have [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) are also packing [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce)s and [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab143_eldraziIntoSpawn.jpg)  
My friend Lewis Laskin suggested that I try to abuse the interaction between Eldrazi Spawn tokens and [Fresh Meat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fresh+Meat). Eldrazi Spawn let you fuel the numbers for your [Fresh Meat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fresh+Meat) at an alarming rate. Think about it. If you have three Eldrazi Spawn on the battlefield you can pay one green mana and upgrade all three tokens into 3/3s. Things get even crazier when you happen to have multiple copies of [Fresh Meat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fresh+Meat).

Eldrazi Spawn seemed like the perfect route for my newest creation. And then... I just can't help it—whenever I think about Eldrazi Spawn, I keep coming back to the same card.

[Beastmaster Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension) has sat in competitive players' binders since [Pro Tour San Juan](/en/events/coverage/paulo-celebrates-six-beach-san-juan) last year. It's an awkward card. Most players see a card like [Beastmaster Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension) and stop reading it after they see that you need seven counters. Seven may seem like a lot, but when you're pumping out Eldrazi Spawn it's never really a problem. You can put three counters on it one turn, and then add another four the next turn when you're going for a lethal attack.

![Beastmaster Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Beastmaster+Ascension)  
The Beastmaster plan seems especially strong here. One of the problems with Beastmaster decks is that they're often put into situations where they have to make unfavorable attacks in order to get counters on a [Beastmaster Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension). [Fresh Meat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fresh+Meat) negates this problem entirely. Not only do you get to upgrade all your 0/1s into 3/3s, but every other creature that was gobbled up by your opponent's blocks will be refunded in the same way.

I'd like to note the importance of Eldrazi Spawn in the current Standard metagame. Eldrazi Spawn offer this deck a lot of resilience against creatures carrying [Sword of Body and Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Body+and+Mind), [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), or [Sword of War and Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+War+and+Peace). Those that have been playing against modern Caw-Blade decks are very aware that [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) is usually charging into the red zone and making things difficult for decks that want to win a game with damage. This deck solves the issue by blocking the [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull)-equipped creature with an Eldrazi Spawn and sacrificing the Spawn before damage, which means that the creature carrying the [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) never deals combat damage, and thus its controller doesn't gain any life.

| Sword of Feast and Famine | Batterskull |

Another card I'd like to include is [Acidic Slime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime). [Acidic Slime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) is going to be a very important tool that's able to destroy [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) if timed properly. Sometimes it's worthwhile to start attacking your opponent's mana base. If a player has missed a land drop then an early [Acidic Slime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) may completely shut them out of the game. At first I thought it was crazy, but I actually want to include a few [Brutalizer Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutalizer+Exarch). [Brutalizer Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutalizer+Exarch) gives us the redundancy we need to effectively combat our opponents' Swords and [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull)s. It also gives us the option of tutoring up some nice one of creatures in post-sideboard games.

I want the deck to play a lot of creatures that accelerate my mana, allowing me to dump my hand onto the table and win with a well-timed [Beastmaster Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension) or [Fresh Meat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fresh+Meat).

[Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), and [Arbor Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf) all seem like pretty obvious inclusions. One-mana accelerators are an excellent way to assure that the majority of our hand is on the table on the earliest turns of the game. [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) used to be difficult to trade for, but it has been reprinted enough times that there seem to be plenty around these days. Birds are also a nice card to have in your **Magic** collection. I still own a playset of *Fourth Edition* [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) that I acquired when I was in junior high. I don't think I've gone a single year without sleeving them up at some point.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab143_3Cards1.jpg)  
[Joraga Treespeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joraga+Treespeaker) is an absolute powerhouse, as it allows us to play our [Acidic Slime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime)s as early as the third turn and makes our explosive draws that much more explosive.

![Joraga Treespeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Joraga+Treespeaker)  
[Awakening Zone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening+Zone) is probably the best way to produce a large number of Eldrazi Spawn. This is one of the most overlooked cards in current Standard. Its effect is immensely powerful for its mana cost and it fits especially well in a deck like this one. All of our turn-one mana accelerators will help guarantee that we can cast the [Awakening Zone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening+Zone) on turn two when it's in our opening hand.

![Awakening Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Awakening+Zone)  
[Nest Invader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) and [Kozilek's Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator) are over obvious inclusions in a deck with this type of strategy. We'll have a massive force on the table before our opponents know what hit them!

The list looks really solid. I want a sideboard plan that lets me board out my [Beastmaster Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension) against decks that are going to have [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim). I wasn't sure at first, but I think siding in [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) and a couple copies of [Triumph of the Hordes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triumph+of+the+Hordes) may be the correct route for a deck like this. Here's the sideboard I would recommend:


> 
> 2 [Triumph of the Hordes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triumph+of+the+Hordes)  
>  3 [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker)  
>  4 [Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth)  
>  1 [Gaea's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Revenge)  
>  1 [Wolfbriar Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfbriar+Elemental)  
>  4 [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim)
> 
> 

I played a few matches with the deck to see how it performed against some of the most popular decks in Standard.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab143_jace.jpg)I lost the roll and kept [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), 2 [Awakening Zone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening+Zone), [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), and [Beastmaster Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension). My opponent played a [Darkslick Shores](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Shores) and cast [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek). I was forced to discard the [Beastmaster Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension). I drew a [Fresh Meat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fresh+Meat), played my [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), cast [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) targeting my Elf and passed the turn back to me. I drew a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played my [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), cast [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), and passed the turn. My opponent played a third land and passed. I drew a [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), cast it, played my land, cast [Awakening Zone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening+Zone), and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed using Jace's 0-loyalty ability, and passed the turn back.

I made an Eldrazi Spawn token, drew a [Fresh Meat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fresh+Meat), cast [Awakening Zone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening+Zone), used [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to shoot my opponent's only red-producing land, and passed the turn. My opponent used Jace to [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), played a [Lavaclaw Reaches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaclaw+Reaches), and passed the turn. I put a pair of Eldrazi Spawn onto the battlefield, played a [Scalding Tarn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn), sacrificed it, and cast [Slagstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagstorm). Before passing priority, I sacrificed all my Eldrazi Spawn for mana and tapped my Birds and [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). I binned all my creatures and cast both copies of [Fresh Meat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fresh+Meat), and my opponent packed it in.
