Having turned 2-2 into 4-2 by the end of the first draft, the perennial Player of the Year contender da Rosa knew that a really good draft would see him in decent shape to make the top 8 in pursuit of a third National title.


He opened with [Throne of Empires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Empires), the kind of card that makes casual players everywhere think 'get all three, get all three' and players like PV think 'I can get a 1/1 every turn with this'. [Gorehorn Minotaurs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorehorn+Minotaurs) was next, followed by [Ã†ther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) and [Belltower Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx). In truth there's not much more to report from the first booster, which finished with a distinct feeling that all had not gone well. All the cards that had rounded out the pack were likely useless to Paulo, barring a radical switch ([Vastwood Gorger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vastwood+Gorger) into green, or [Drifting Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drifting+Shade) wanting a huge push to black).

*One pack down, two to go*

[Fear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fear) not, Paulo fans around the world. Things started to come together very nicely in pack two. Obviously you expect to find some decent picks early, so - although good - [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate), [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock), and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) weren't anything to get excited about. You're meant to be getting solid playables there, or even better, big fat juicy bombs. What made things get good in a hurry were the mid- and late picks. [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) at five. [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear) six. [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) seven. Suddenly a blue-red aggro deck was coming together. [Lightning Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Elemental) next, then another [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear).


Now we're at pick ten, and you're really not expecting much. [Act of Treason](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) in an aggro deck? That'll do nicely. Now we're at pick eleven, and you're really not expecting much. [Act of Treason](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) in an aggro deck? That'll do nicely too.

*On the left, Incinerate. On the right, Gideon Jura!*

On we went to pack three, and for what seemed like the umpteenth time in the draft Paulo found a [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) that he just couldn't justify taking. He thought about [Phantasmal Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Dragon), made a mental note about the [Sengir Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire) in the pack, and then took [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate). [Goblin Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Fireslinger) was next, and then another [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) went begging when he took [Azure Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Mage). [Bonebreaker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonebreaker+Giant), [Phantasmal Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Dragon), and [Belltower Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx) were all going to make his deck, and it wasn't until he was forced to take an [Armored Warhorse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Warhorse) that he 'missed' on a pick, but that was already pick eight. There was still time to steal away a [Peregrine Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Griffin), and then happily take - finally - a [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) that had come all the way back round to him pick nine.


When you think about great players, you naturally assume that they're going to be playing all kinds of cards that you wouldn't think of. Pros don't burn people's faces off. Pros don't cast [Lightning Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Elemental) and then [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) them in your face. Pros don't go [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) you, [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) you, [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) you, good game.


This one does. This one will, because this one wants a third National title, Pro Points, and a Player of the Year Title.


Time to burninate...
