FABIANO DELVED TO VICTORY AT GRAND PRIX BALTIMORE

TOP 8 COVERAGE



1,235 players arrived for *Khans of Tarkir* Sealed Deck, giving way to 148 to draft on the second day and a star-studded Top 8 to cap it all off. In his second Grand Prix Top 8 in the calendar year, Gerard Fabiano again found victory in Limited, earning the title of Grand Prix Baltimore champion.


Entering Day 2 needing to win out both of his drafts, Fabiano found his footing with a powerful Sultai deck to close out his finals against David Foster, finalist at his second Grand Prix ever. Along the way, Fabiano stopped the hyper-aggressive deck Pro Tour *Dragon’s Maze* winner Craig Wescoe as well as twenty-second-ranked Ben Stark’s white-black Warriors (who had to hurdle past twentieth-ranked Josh Utter-Leyton’s Temur deck). With the era of *Khans of Tarkir* Limited closing – *Fate Reforged* is coming up quickly – the game’s greats continue to power out victory in what many call the greatest Limited format in years.


The 2014 year is closing out but the first Grand Prix season of 2015 is just heating up. Join us in the first weekend of the new year for a double Standard weekend at Grand Prix Denver and Grand Prix Manila!

DAY 2 COVERAGE



Draft!


From the 1,235 attendees that battled through nine rounds of Khans of Tarkir Sealed Deck, just 148 have returned to pick their way to destiny at Grand Prix Baltimore. While the forty-card count of the decks will remain the same, the contents shift to what players choose for themselves.


The echoes of “Draft!” will ring twice before the Top 8 is determined.


Leading the way entering the day are five undefeated players from Day 1: fifth-ranked Reid Duke, fresh off his rallying performance at the World Championship; Craig Wescoe, champion of Pro Tour Dragon’s Maze; Andrew Cuneo and Chris Pikula, long-time players finding their resurgence; and David Foster. Whoever emerges from their first draft pod with a 3-0 record will find points, and positioning, for the Top 8.


Join us at 10:30 AM Eastern at [Twitch.tv/ggslive](http://www.twitch.tv/ggslive) with Marshall Sutcliffe, Randy Buehler, and Gabe Carlton-Barnes to watch *Khans of Tarkir* Draft unfold in the race to another Grand Prix champion!
