It took a lot of work for [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) to exist. Let's go back to the beginning.

### The Magic Invitational

The **Magic** Invitational started life as the *Duelist* Invitational, but when *Duelist* Magazine stopped existing, the name got changed. It was a sixteen-person tournament with the unique prize of getting to design a **Magic** card. And the winner would then get depicted in the art! Here's the list of winners:

Actually, though, that wasn't Tiago's original submission. This was his first request:

>  Denying Channel

> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif): Add ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) to your mana pool.

R&D tried this card out, but they decided that a land that could also be an uncounterable counterspell was too strong to print. So they asked Tiago for another version. And that turned into [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)!

So much for the text on the card. Let's move on to the art! Here's the art description that was given to Volkan Baga:


> Color: Blue creature  
>  Action: Start with the reference. Design a bad-ass human mage based on the reference. He is wearing a metal arm enhancement with glass tubing that contains ghost energy. We can see the ghosts swirling around inside the glass. The mage should look smart and powerful.  
>  Focus: The mage  
>  Mood: Powerful, smart, dangerous 
> 
> 

Volkan decided to sketch in his own face for the early stages of the piece. Here's the first version:

The creative team decided the helmet was distracting and asked Volkan to remove it. He did so and made a variety of other little changes you can find for yourself:

By this time, Tiago had provided a few headshots of himself and Volkan finished the piece up with Tiago's face.

And here's the final card as it appears in *Innistrad* booster packs. Tiago Chan, everybody!
