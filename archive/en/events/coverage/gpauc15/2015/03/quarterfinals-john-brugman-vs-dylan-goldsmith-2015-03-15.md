Dylan Goldsmith was off to a rough start with a mulligan to six, then only finding two Forests on the first three Turns. John Brugman pushed ahead, first with a Highland Game, then a [Frontier Mastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frontier+Mastodon), then a Morph.

On Turn 4 Goldsmith found third land, but as it was a [Rugged Highlands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rugged+Highlands), it prevented him from playing his three mana creatures. Brugman continued making his land drops, and therefore his creature drops. By the time Goldsmith landed a creature, a [Goblin Heelcutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Heelcutter) from Brugman made sure it was too late.

Goldsmith was off to a worse start in Game 2, as he mulliganed to 5 cards. Brugman was not applying early pressure, however, and Goldsmith ran out three [Embodiment of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embodiment+of+Spring). Brugman started to build a board presence, first with a morph, then a [Goblin Heelcutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Heelcutter) and a [Bear's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bear%27s+Companion).

Still struggling on three mana, and with his life total dropping fast, Goldsmith cast [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws) to kill the Heelcutter, and next turn bounced the Bear Token with a [Force Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Away). With his opponent tapped out, Brugman attacked with the [Snowhorn Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snowhorn+Rider) and [Bear's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bear%27s+Companion). Goldsmith used his final [Embodiment of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embodiment+of+Spring) to block the [Bear's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bear%27s+Companion). In response Brugman cast [Temur Battle Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Battle+Rage) on the [Snowhorn Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snowhorn+Rider) to quickly end the game.



**Brugman 2 - Goldsmith 0**
