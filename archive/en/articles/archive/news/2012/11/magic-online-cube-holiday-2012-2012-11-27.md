Magic Online Cube: Holiday 2012
===============================



 Posted in **News**
 on November 27, 2012 










he [Power Nine](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/432) is coming to **Magic Online** on December 19, and you can play with them in the new **Magic Online** Cube: Holiday 2012! Completely redesigned, this 540-card Cube includes the nine most powerful **Magic** cards ever printed, along with other over-powered accomplices. If you've never had a chance to cast a Black Lotus or the Moxen for some over-the-top first turn play, here is your chance.


![Magic Online Cube Booster](https://web.archive.org/web/20160405082915im_/http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/MTGPOW_booster_sty_001.png "Magic Online Cube Booster")
 

As always, Cube is about the cards, and with the Holiday Cube Max MaCall and the R&D team didn't pull any punches. All of the heavy-hitters are present, including many with new art! [Read Max's article](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/223b&date=11/27/2012) for design insight into the Holiday Cube and check out the full card list below.


The Holiday Cube drafts begin after the downtime on Wednesday, December 19, and run until the downtime on Wednesday, January 2. Two queues—a single-elimination queue and a Swiss queue—will be available during this time and the full event details can be found below. Like last time, joining the Holiday Cube drafts requires either Event Tickets or a combination of Event Tickets and Cube Tickets. If you have Cube Tickets left over from last time, you can use those to join the new Holiday Cube.


We are very excited about the Holiday Cube and hope you have fun slinging the most powerful **Magic**cards ever printed. Good drafting and good luck!


**Note:** There will be no **Magic Online** Championship Series Qualifier Point (QP) prizes for events after the downtime on December 19 until 10:00 AM on December 26. 2013 **Magic Online** Championship Series QPs will only be available as prizes for events that start after 10:00 AM on December 26.
