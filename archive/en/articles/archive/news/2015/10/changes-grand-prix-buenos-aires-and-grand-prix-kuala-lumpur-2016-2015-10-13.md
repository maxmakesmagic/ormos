Changes to Grand Prix Buenos Aires and Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur 2016

Due to unforeseeable circumstances, some changes are being made to the 2016 Grand Prix schedule.  


Because of the political situation in Argentina, the tournament organizer for Grand Prix Buenos Aires, originally scheduled to take place March 18–20, 2016, has recommended that we cancel the Grand Prix for 2016 and instead revisit Argentina for a Grand Prix in the years following. The Grand Prix for 2016 has therefore been cancelled.


Malaysia's political situation deteriorated at the end of August 2015, and as a result of this, we moved Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur to October in 2016 to allow more time for conditions to settle. Unfortunately, due to the needs of the Malaysian government to book the venue during the weekend of October 7–9, 2016, the date for Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur has been pushed further to October 21–23, 2016. The format has been changed to Standard Constructed to match the format of Grand Prix Providence, which is also taking place that weekend.
