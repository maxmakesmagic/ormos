How Changes to Block Rotation Will Impact *Magic Online* Redemption
Mark Rosewater talked about big changes to the *Magic* block rotation schedule in today's [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mm/metamorphosis). The block sets will behave in *Magic Online* just as they have been outlined in Mark’s article, and will rotate out of the Standard format on the same schedule as face-to-face *Magic*.


In terms of how the rotation change will impact Redemption on *Magic Online*, sets will become available for redemption approximately 30 days after their release date on *Magic Online*, just as they do now.


The Redemption Guarantee date is the last date a set is guaranteed to be available for redemption and will continue to be scheduled for approximately 30 days after a given set rotates out of Standard. Unchanged from the current practice, once the Guarantee date has passed, inventory for that set will no longer be replenished—redemption for that set could become unavailable at any point until the Cutoff date. The Redemption Cutoff is the last time players are able to redeem a given set. The Redemption Cutoff has been, and will continue to be the date by which redemption for a given set will come to an end, regardless of inventory availability. The Redemption Cutoff date will occur approximately a year after the Redemption Guarantee date.


You can always find the current redemption schedule  [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/products/magiconline/redemption). For specific set redemption, please check the *Magic Online* store. For full policies around *Magic Online*  redemption, please go [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/products/magiconline/redemption-policies).
