Patrick "Trick" Jarrett oversees web content and social media for Magic, and acts as the publisher of DailyMTG.com and Magic content on the web. He's an ardent Commander player and lover of the game he's played since Ice Age. 







Last Friday, a new exhibit opened at Seattle's [EMP Museum](http://www.empmuseum.org), the "[Fantasy: Worlds of Myth and Magic](http://empmuseum.org/at-the-museum/current-exhibits/fantasy-worlds-of-myth-and-magic.aspx)," of which Wizards of the Coast is a supporting sponsor. With props from a number of well-known fantasy worlds such as Middle Earth, Oz, Hogwarts, and Westeros, we were very excited to have art from **Magic** included in this exhibit.

As part of the grand opening we sent out a few people you might recognize:

We also gave attendees packs of ***Magic** 2013* to take home and play with. Of course, **Magic** wasn't the only group there, one of the other main draws were the talks being given by well-known names including author Terry Brooks.
