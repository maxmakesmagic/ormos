So, we were like, "Hey DXTR, we really like that card you did for us before. Wanna do a cycle of artifact lands?" And DXTR was like, "Yup." And like, we were expecting some super-cool, hand-painted, pixel art-inspired pieces, but instead, he went ALL OUT, and we got these WILD pieces just dripping with detail and lore. Krark's on one of 'em! AND his thumb! There's so much going on, and every inch of it just oozes cool! (Actual cards do not ooze or drip.)

Ever wonder what some of *Magic*'s weirdest creatures look like on the inside? Us neither, but Timba Smits showed us the truth: they look pretty sweet! Consider these cards your intro lesson on the inner workings of some ravenous beasties. The alternative is to let a giant dino eat you, and that presents more logistical errors than we can address in a simple product description. Whether you surgically implant these cards inside your deck or proudly display them to educate passersby, you can rest soundly knowing you've shared knowledge with the world. And that, friend, is a beautiful thing.

Just like how all of us always read the full terms of service agreement, it's important to scrutinize the fine print of any contract. If Liliana had, she would have discovered that upon the death of her demonic sponsors, the control of her contract defaulted to someone much more . . . Bolas-y. To celebrate the spooky season and this cool piece of *Magic* history, we asked artist ZIUK to lend us his considerable talents to portray Liliana and her demons in their full, gold-plated glory. Whether you want to play these cards or just stare at them forever, they can be yours—no demonic contract required.
