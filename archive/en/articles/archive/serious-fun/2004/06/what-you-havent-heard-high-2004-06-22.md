Angels that should get more casual play
---------------------------------------


In a column entitled Serious Fun, you might expect to hear a great deal during Angel week about the great champions of casual play – stuff like [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath); [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel); [Blinding Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Angel); [Radiant, Archangel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant%2C+Archangel); and so on...


Eh. Not so much.


I'm sure the more popular, prettier angels will get plenty of attention from my fellow magicthegathering.com writers this week. I'll spend today talking instead about those angels that *don't* see much current play in casual circles.


How would I know what is played and what is not? Am I omniscient, like an angel? Do I have a guardian angel who whispers decklists from around the world into my hallowed ear? Do I use angels like carrier pigeons to send certain cards out to casual players, while denying them others?


No. I'm sort of guessing. But I base these guesses on three things: (1) the decks our large (13+) group plays, (2) the large quantity of emails I continue to get with decklists, (3) what I read on the Internet, and (4) what I see at local tournaments and in shops, when I can still get out there.


I'm surprised I don't see some of the seven heavenly creatures below more often, in those contexts. (In fact, I was surprised to learn *I* didn't even know one of them, until I did some research.)


### 7. Silver Seraph



![Silver Seraph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Silver+Seraph)

What a splash this made when *Judgment* came out! Everyone talked about squirrel tokens and threshold decks and how eight mana wasn't really that much. Then [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath) came along, and showed us what eight mana can truly buy.


This thing's been buried so deep since then, I actually had to read the description before I remembered what it does. Heck, Akroma's so unbelievably good, I had to read the Seraph's description before I remembered what *threshold* does.


But let's not completely forget this *Odyssey* block gem. Last I checked, *Mirrodin* block was chock-full of useful 1/1 creatures...and they're *mana accelerators*. Drop mana myrs (e.g., [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr)) as fast as you can, you can get [Silver Seraph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Seraph) out by turn 5 with mana to spare. Of course, it won't be as impressive until you have seven cards in your graveyard – that's why you'll use another *Mirrodin* tool, [Mesmeric Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Orb), to help that happen. Or use a million spellbombs. Or [Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble).


Silver Seraph is *good*, people. And *Mirrodin* block made it even better. Play it!


### 6. Angelic Curator



![Angelic Curator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Angelic+Curator)

Okay, I'm technically cheating on this one, since it's not an angel. But it is *angelic*, and like [Silver Seraph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Seraph), *Mirrodin* block makes it a whole lot better...though for the opposite reasons.


[Angelic Curator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Curator) blocks [Darksteel Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Gargoyle), [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem), [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel), and a host of other impressive creatures without breaking a sweat.


Many veterans played this with [Caltrops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caltrops) back in the day, and that's still a nifty little trick. I'd also suggest some *Mirrodin* tech, in the form of [Culling Scales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Culling+Scales), for some excellent early-game control.


### 5. Crypt Angel



![Crypt Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crypt+Angel)

It's not always easy to remember some angels *don't do white*. [Crypt Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Angel) is a heck of a bad girl, and she's only going to get worse as more red and blue creatures show up with comes-into-play or leaves-play abilities. [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu) was an early favorite, but you don't have to stop there. More recent cards (or reprints) include [Clone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone), [Sage Aven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Aven), [Goblin Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Pyromancer), and [Embermage Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermage+Goblin)...and those are just the ones that fit neatly in the four-mana slot...


Oh, she also has protection from white. I'll bet at least one opponent forgets that, the next time you break out this beauty. Don't remind them.


### 4. Haunted Angel



![Haunted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Haunted+Angel)

Not just good in decks sporting [Confusion in the Ranks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confusion+in+the+Ranks) (though watch what happens when all of those angel tokens show up!), [Haunted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Angel) was immediately underrated as soon as it was printed. A simple blue-white deck with stuff like [Man-o'-War](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Man-o%27-War) and [Rushing River](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rushing+River) should be able to handle the drawback to this cheap and powerful flier.


Of course, you can always be trickier, and play her with [Tainted Aether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Aether), [Sunken Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunken+Hope), [Hidden Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Spider), [Lethal Vapors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lethal+Vapors), [Intruder Alarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intruder+Alarm), or [Spreading Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Plague). Heck, even [Story Circle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Story+Circle) or [Voice of Grace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Grace) will probably work.


### 3. That 4/4 token from Angelic Favor



![Angelic Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Angelic+Favor)

So many of us forget the hidden treats of Masques block. Prime among them are the alternate play cost spells. White actually has a couple of really clever ones – I love [Reverent Mantra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Mantra) – but one worth mentioning this week is [Angelic Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Favor).


A 4/4 token in the air is a mighty blocker. (With [Anger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger) in your graveyard and a mountain in play, it's not a bad attacker, either!) Opponents continually gauge their attack schemes on variables like: Does he have any flyers? Is he tapped out?


As soon as they see your lands tapped out and creatures miserably tied to the ground, they send that wimpy little [Gaea's Skyfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Skyfolk) sniffing around. But alas for the Skyfolk – the tiny [Eager Cadet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eager+Cadet) far below has an answer. He lies down to take a nap, and WHAP! His guardian angel flies up and smacks the smug look right off that waterlogged elven face.


This is a card that works well with non-tapping creatures – e.g., [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) or an equipped [Leonin Den-Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Den-Guard).


### 2. Guiding Spirit



![Guiding Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Guiding+Spirit)

I'm embarrassed to say I didn't even know about this card until I did research for this article. That doesn't happen much, anymore. By that I mean there are plenty of Magic cards I still don't know about or have forgotten, I'm sure; but very few I'd expect to *care* about. How did this one slip past my sensors?


You can target *any* player with this, which makes it ideal for team play – or for really kicking a mana-screwed opponent as they discard over-expensive creatures on turns three and four. (Yeah, I know, that's really mean. But tell me you wouldn't like to try it, at least once.)


And of course, you can also use it on yourself! Nice for white and blue to have access to a miniature [Volrath's Stronghold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath%27s+Stronghold). I like this with [Raven Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raven+Familiar) and [Radiant's Dragoons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant%27s+Dragoons). It's also a worthy addition to your [Reya Dawnbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reya+Dawnbringer) deck (if you're already splashing blue), since there are very few creatures that can bring Reya herself back from the dead.


*Mirage* block. Huh. Who knew?


### 1. Copper-Leaf Angel



![Copper-Leaf Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Copper-Leaf+Angel)

The artwork was always beautiful; but the [Copper-Leaf Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper-Leaf+Angel) was always the signature card of *Prophecy*: not enough power in an overhyped rare.


Well, maybe it's improved a bit since then. See if this little ditty appeals to you:

Yes, modular creatures and [Crucible of Worlds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+Worlds) have made [Copper-Leaf Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper-Leaf+Angel) quite good. You can also play the Angel in more protective environments – that is, with stuff like [Leonin Abunas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Abunas) – to make sure your investment of lands isn't wasted. Heck, you can even sack a bunch of lands to the Angel and then use one or more [Power Conduit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Conduit)s to direct charge counters onto a [Darksteel Reactor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Reactor). But that feels like a different deck...


Bottom line? This angel, like the other six, has lots of new skies to explore. You don't have to wait for a "tribal format" night. Just pick one or two, grab a harp, and go!
