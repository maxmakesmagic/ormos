Here are two images from *Ice Age*, both by artist Brian Snōddy, that contain little "hidden messages" in Norse runes:

On [Disenchant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant), the characters on the sword blade are from an alphabet known as the "Anglo-Saxon Futhorc." They spell out "MAGIK," or **Magic**.

On [Chaos Lord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Lord), the characters on his shield are from the "Elder Futhark" runic alphabet. They spell out "I AM REALE MEAN," which is as close to "I am really mean" as you can get with that alphabet. He sure is.
