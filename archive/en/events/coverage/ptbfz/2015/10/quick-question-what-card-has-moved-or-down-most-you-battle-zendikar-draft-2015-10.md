When a new set comes out, players always rank the cards in rough order of what they think the power level is. Of course, as they actually play with the set—and in many cases go to "draft camp" before the Pro Tour—those evaluations change. So what has moved for these competitors at Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar?*

**Ari Lax:** [Turn Against](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+Against) isn't as good as I thought it would be. I remember [Blind with Anger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+with+Anger) and [Act of Aggression](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Aggression) were unbeatable, but with the way the power and toughness line up in this format, [Turn Against](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+Against) just isn't that good. It's five mana and it usually just acts as a conditional removal spell.

**Craig Wescoe:** [Kalastria Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Healer) has moved up. Yesterday I got it on the 13th pick, twice. It's the best card in the white-black lifegain deck, and one of the best commons in the color.

**Hall of Famer Raphaël Lévy:** [Swarm Surge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+Surge) is better than I thought. It's the kind of card that closes games, and it's a common that's better than a lot of rares at doing that. In the right deck, when you play it, you just win.
