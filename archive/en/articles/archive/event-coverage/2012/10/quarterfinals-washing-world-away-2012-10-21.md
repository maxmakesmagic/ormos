"Looking at my decklist, I see," Sajgalik noticed. "What do you think?"


"No new cards! No fun," Lee chided as he perused the list. "Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica*!"


"I've got [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), that's a new one. And [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain) is technically a new card," Sajgalik said in his defense.


"Are you playing the *Return to Ravnica* ones?" one of the judges asked from the sidelines?


"Uh...no."


"So boring," laughed Lee!


"Wait...Where are your *Return to Ravnica* cards?" Sajgalik accused.


"[Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm)," Lee beamed pointing to the Izzet pin on his hoodie!


By virtue of being the higher seed, Lee won the right to choose to play. Lee was forced to re-sleeve his deck before the Quarterfinals, leaving him a bit behind the other players and with a deck that looked twice the size of Sajgalik's.


"Wow, did you double sleeve that?!" Sajgalik asked him.


"No, these are just new sleeves. I don't understand it," he laughed in response.


"Well, play or draw?" Sakgalik asked him.


"Play! Come on, no one draws in this format," he derisively responded.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptrtr12/qf_sajgalik_lee1.jpg) *Eduard Dajgalik's white-blue control deck goes up against Lee Shi Tian's explosive [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) deck in the Quarterfinals.* 
### Game 1


Both players had to mulligan their opening hands, carefully pile shuffling their decks before presenting them again. For the second go around, Lee considered with a stern look on his face before deciding to keep his hand. Sajgalik prolonged the opening even more by going back for five.


"I'm trying to get a few more lands in my opening hand than one," he weakly laughed.


The other matches had finished their first games before these players made their opening plays.


As Sajgalik shuffled his deck in an attempt to get a reasonable hand, the two players discussed their common ties to England, where Sajgalik lives and Lee was an exchange student.


"It was great; I had a lot of fun while I was there. The week before I was supposed to go back home, I won Grand Prix Birmingham. That was a good day," Lee beamed.



![Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft)

"Yeah, I Top 32'd that tournament. It was a pretty good day for me, too."


Despite a good shuffle from both players, Sajgalik was still dissatisfied with his hand yet again, going down to four cards.


"I think game 1 is in my favor," Lee said, trying to console Sajgalik that his mulligans weren't hurting him as much in this game as they could in the others.


"Hah, it certainly is now," Sajgalik burst out with a laugh! "You don't know my record in mulligans to four, though. I have never been defeated in a feature match where I had to mulligan to four..."


Sajgalik quickly kept his four card hand, remarking that it was still the best hand he'd drawn yet. The first few turns passed with both players simply playing lands and passing the turn. Sajgalik tried to make a [Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft) on the third turn, but a [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) was going to force him to try again on the following turn. Rather than try, he simply passed the turn back to Lee with four lands available, including a [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), and four cards in hand. When Lee played his fifth land and passed the turn to Sajgalik, the English player used the opportunity to set a [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel) on the table. Once again, Lee had [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), this time off of a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), and the board remained clear. With Lee down to one untapped land, Sajgalik used the opportunity to stick his 3/4 flier.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptrtr12/qf_sajgalik1.jpg) *Sajgalik laughs off a mulligan to four.* 
Lee drew his card and put his forehead in his hand, thinking deeply about which play to make. He held six cards and was a couple of lands from being able to safely [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) combo Sajgalik out. He played his sixth and used a [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow) to grab the seventh. He was almost ready to try and end things. With enough mana available to cast [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), Lee ended his turn.


Now Sajgalik had to think. Lee was representing both [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) and a chance to go off on the following turn. He simply drew his card and passed the turn, leaving his [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) and other lands untapped. He only had two blue sources, so Command was not an option. Lee drew his card and began to fuss with his lands. A fairly simple turn, Lee just played a [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) and passed his turn. At the end of Lee's turn, Sajgalic made a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) with no targets to simply get another attacker into play and used his [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to blow up the [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle) on Lee's side.



![Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cryptic+Command)

"I need to think. You've got four cards in hand. At least one of them is [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) and another is [Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm)," Sajgalik mused.


"Hmm..maybe," Lee said nonchalantly.


Sajgalik attacked with his Mage, dropping Lee to 18, played another [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), and passed the turn. At the end of the turn, Lee aimed a [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to tap Sajgalik's creatures and bounce his [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault). Sajgalik thought for a while about what to do, slowing the pace of play. Both players had been pausing quite a bit in a match that was already well behind the others, prompting the judges to continually prompt them to play. Eventually, Sajgalik used the land for mana before returning it, using the mana afterward to cast a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique). Lee had the [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), and he now had Sajgalik tapped out. On his turn, he attacked with his [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)caster, dropping Sajgalik to 17, before casting [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). Sajgalik made him go through the motions, pulling out six [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s and a [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle), dealing 18 to Sajgalik to finish him off.


Eduardo Sajgalik 0, Lee Shi Tian 1


### Game 2


Sajgalik's wonderful luck continued, as he had to mulligan his opening hand, and Lee didn't think too long before once again joining him. By this point, there was one game win the books and an astounding five mulligans between both players.


"Maybe we'll get to start at least one game with seven cards apiece," Sajgalik joked, clearly taking his unfortunate circumstance in stride. His second hand was good enough that it warranted an ecstatic thumbs-up. Lee kept his hand after much consideration at well. At least things were improving.


Sajgalik opened with a [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) while Lee opened with a [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest) into an untapped [Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool), allowing him to suspend a [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow). He suspended two more copies on the following turn, giving him a potentially huge leg up in the mana department. Sajgalik hindered his development some by casting a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) to stop the first one from resolving, but that trick wouldn't work as well when the next two came up on the following turn. At the end of Sjgalik's turn, Lee played one of the innovative cards in his decklist, [Telling Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telling+Time), to set things up for his next turn.


Sajgalik had something in store to see what Lee had arranged, however, using a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) after Lee's draw to spy on his hand. He saw a hand of [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), [Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm), and [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). He wasted little time in writing the cards down and choosing to wash away the eponymous [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). Lee drew to replace it and then searched out a pair of lands from his deck.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptrtr12/qf_lee1.jpg) *Lee sits comfortably behind a large number of lands, which are a lot more threatening when [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) is looming.* 
Sajgalik was a bit behind in this game. He hadn't yet drawn a fourth land, leaving him pressed to defend himself against Lee. With a sever mana advantage, Lee would be able to cast a [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) and protect it before too long. Sajgalik attacked, drawing the [Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm) from Lee's hand. With the Clique dead, Sajgalik replaced it with a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), unable to wait to take advantage of the triggered ability due to both mana issues and the fact that Lee was threatening a combo as soon as he hit a [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift).


Sajgalik began to attack with the 2/1. Lee tried to drop one of his own in to deal with Sajglaik's Mage, but he was stopped by [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare). With his incredible mana advantage, Lee pressed back, using [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to counter the Snare and draw a card. After letting that resolve, Sajgalik used a second [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) to ensure that the Mage never saw play. Lee dropped to 11, a victim of his own lands.


An eighth land hit play and Lee went for a [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). Sajgalik had two cards in hand and three mana available. He was still at 20, so he decided to use [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to kill a [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground)s, reducing the number of lands Lee could [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) out to seven. He grabbed six [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s and a [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle). Lee sent all of the damage at Sajgalik, dropping him to 2 and leaving the Mage intact. Sajgalik grabbed Lee's graveyard to count the [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s he had used. Satisfied, he played a [Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft) and passed the turn. That was the last chance Sajgalik would have, as Lee had a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) from his deck to send things to game 3.


Eduardo Sajgalik 0, Lee Shi Tian 2


This Quarterfinals match had been plagued by problems, from the many mulligans to the mana issues that had prevented Sajgalik from properly defending himself in the last one. Lee had also been fairly lucky that he had managed to find a second [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) in time after having his first one removed with the [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) in game 2. Apart from the combo, [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) decks can only really deal damage in small bits, relying heavily on the powerful sorcery to win the game, and against Sajgalik's white-blue deck, which doesn't take as much land damage as many others, the deck doesn't get as much leeway to combo early as it does against other decks.


### Game 3



![Volcanic Fallout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Volcanic+Fallout)

For the third game, there were surprisingly no mulligans, with both players somehow finding seven cards they liked. Lee began with a first-turn [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), keeping both cards from the scry on the top of his deck. On his second turn, he had a [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground) come into play untapped, signaling a [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) or [Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm). Because of this, Sajgalik made no effort to play a spell on his turn, simply adding a land and passing the turn. The same situation occurred on the following turn, but this time, when Sajgalik passed his turn this time, Lee went for a [Telling Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telling+Time). Sajgalik thought about doing something before simply allowing it to happen. After Lee had set things up, Sajgalik used a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) to spy on the plan, using it while he had Lee tapped out. The Clique revealed a hand with two [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)s, [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow), [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique), [Volcanic Fallout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout), and a [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground). Sajgalik removed the [Volcanic Fallout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout) and let Lee take his turn.


Lee returned the favor with a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) of his own. Two [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare)s, [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), and an [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa). Lee was perfectly fine with the cards in Sajgalik's hand, choosing to remove nothing. On his turn, Sajgalik used his [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to destroy Lee's [Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool). Knowing that Lee had only one more land in his hand, Sajgalik tried to keep Lee off of [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) mana, delaying the turn when he would combo out. With things delayed some, Sajgalik decided to put a threat on the table, a [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks). The Finks are a great threat against [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle) due to their lifegain as well as their function as an attacker. Each extra [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) needed by the [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle) player is one more turn gained. Lee tried to [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), but a [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) kept him from stopping the ouphe.


Lee began to build his mana. His [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow) came off of suspend, fetching him and [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). He also used a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) to replay it, netting a third [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). Sajgalik still kept his mana under assault, however, using a second [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to destroy a [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground), keeping Lee on only one green source. Rather than face eventual death to the Finks, Lee decided to trade his Mage for the Finks, fully aware that it would persist and gain Sajgalik an additional two life. The Finks kept attacking, dropping Lee down in increments of 2.


With Lee at 8, Sajgalik tried to end the game, playing a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). Lee tried to use a [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) to stop it, but a second [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)caster threatened to [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) the [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand). This would also give Sajgalik a third creature to go along with his [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), lethal with Lee at 8. Sajgalik let them both resolve, spelling doom on the following turn. With Sajgalik on one untapped land, Lee used [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within) on one of his lands to get a blocker and stay alive. Sajgalik attacked Lee down to two and then aimed a third [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) at Lee's [Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptrtr12/qf_sajgalik2.jpg) *Sajgalik's deck runs a lot more effectively with a seven card hand in the third game.* 
"Three Edge... nice," Lee commented, knowing that the land had been instrumental in Sajgalik's game plan.


With one more attack, Sajgalik had come back from two games down to take the third, keeping his chances of advancing alive.


Eduardo Sajgalik 1, Lee Shi Tian 2


"These games really do come down to how many [Tectonic] Edges you draw. Last game you drew three," Lee observed between games.


"I did also get to draw seven cards that game," Sajgalik countered, not wishing to have his large number of mulligans so far this match end up forgotten.


### Game 4



![Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine)

Surprisingly, both players yet again kept their openers. Lee began with a [Halimar Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths), using it to set up his next draws. He followed that with a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), which Sajgalik was unable to stop due to his first land being a [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade). After that, Lee just began to attack. Sajgalik made a [Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft), which Lee let resolve. At the end of Sajgalik's turn, Lee took a peek under the hood with a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique). What he saw drew a long pause. Three [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel)s, [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), and [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) were a good enough hand that Lee remarked under his breath about Sajgalik's "nice draw". After deliberating to the point that a judge forced him to act, Lee took the [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine).


The reason soon became apparent, as Lee attacked with his Clique and added an [Obstinate Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth) to his team. He'd gone aggro, and he was bringing a big fighter to bear. Sajgalik found a fourth land, but his [Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast) came into play tapped. There would be no [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel) chain this turn. Lee attacked with his team, dropping Sajgalik to 9. When Sajgalik tried to cast a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) to fight back, Lee used a [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to counter it and return the [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) to his hand, trying to pin Sajgalik to three lands once more. Unfortunately for him, Sajgalik drew his card, snapped an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) into play with a smile, and sent his Geist over. Lee blocked the Geist with his Elder and sacrificed it, taking 4 from the Angel token. After combat, Sajgalik used a [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel) to untap the Geist, ready for the follow-up attack from Sajgalik.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptrtr12/qf_lee2.jpg) *Lee carefully plots out his aggressive play in the fourth game.* 
And attack he did, sending in both his Clique and the Baloth, undeterred. The Angel blocked the Clique and the Baloth dropped Sajgalik to 5. With five lands in play, Lee pushed things up further with a pair of [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow)s. With two cards in hand, Sajgalik began to wonder about what the next turn held in store. Seven lands was lethal should Lee resolve a [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). Knowing that Sajgalik still had a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) in hand, Lee could at least afford to pay for the first one with his seven lands. Sajgalik thought for a minute about his decisions, again prompting Head Judge Jason Lemahieu to prompt him to play. With his back against the wall, Sajgalik attacked, dropping Lee to 9.


Now it was Lee's turn to think. He managed to decide to attack with his Baloth before the judges broke out their cattle prods, forcing Sajgalik to go to 1, though he was forcefully unhappy about it, worried that Lee might have [Volcanic Fallout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout). Once he realized that he didn't, he became visibly relieved. Heavily visibly relieved, breathing so deeply you'd have thought he just finished a marathon. After combat, play resumed its glacial pace. At the end of Lee's turn, Sajgalik slowly dropped a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) into play, hands shaking.



![Telling Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Telling+Time)

Lee's face showed a mixture of concern and curiosity. In response to the [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)caster, Lee tapped two mana and simply sat there staring at Sajgalik's board. At this point, the Head Judge stepped in to inform the players that the pace of play was unacceptable, and any future comments from the judges would be accompanied by penalties. With the warning out of the way, Lee set about casting and resolving his [Telling Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telling+Time). In pieces. One card went straight to the bottom of the deck. The other two sat in a sort of limbo for 30-45 seconds before the Head Judge stepped in to issue the first warning for slow play, informing Lee that he would be given a game loss should the pace of play continue to be so slow.


[Clear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clear)ly rattled, Lee cast a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). That resolved, but even still it was lethal. A [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) from Lee met the [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) remaining in Sajgalik's hand. With that, the amount of damage on the table was lethal, and Lee conceded the game.


Eduardo Sagjalik 2, Lee Shi Tian 2


Lee was clearly rattled by the decision to issue him a slow play warning and the looming possibility of a game loss should the syrupy pace of play continue. After making an appeal for the Head Judge to watch Sajgalik for the same slow pace of play, Lee tried to calm himself down and mentally prepare himself for a difficult final game.


### Game 5


Sagjalik had battled back from a two-game deficit with remarkable poise, especially considering that both wins came out of precarious situations. He was definitely nervous playing on this stage, as his hands shook with each play. However he still maintained focus, making the correct plays as needed. He would be tested on the draw now, just as he was in the previous game. If he was able to draw enough disruption, he might be able to steal this match back away from Lee and advance to the Semifinals.



![Flooded Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Flooded+Grove)

Lee presented his deck and gave himself a trio of Saito-esque slaps to focus himself. He was far more enthusiastic about his keeps from any of the previous games, possibly indicating a very good hand. He opened with a [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle), and a [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents), untapped. Lee made his first play at the end of Sajgalik's third turn, using an [Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm) (new card!) to draw two cards and discard two [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal)s. A [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest) got him a basic [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), possibly indicating a pair of two mana counterspells in his hand. When he found a [Flooded Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Grove) on his turn, he found himself with access to [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command).


Sajgalik tried to land a [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) on his turn, but it met an immediate [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) from Lee. Sajgalik had a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and he chose to cast it despite Lee having three mana. With the card still in his hand, he attempted to retract his play, but Lee made sure that the judge held him to his intended play. After an appeal, where Sajgalik contended that he had not announced a target, the Head Judge revealed that the tournament ruling is that if there is no announced target of a clearly cast spell, the spell must target the top spell on the stack. Thus the [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) was paid for and the [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) resolved.


With the minor break over, Lee drew his card and suspended a [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow), leaving up mana for [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). When Sajgalik tried to cast a [Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft), Lee targeted it with [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand). Sajgalik countered with [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare), and the Geist hit play. Sajgalik passed the turn with a pair of lands available.



![Halimar Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Halimar+Depths)

Lee did very little on his turn, merely using a [Halimar Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths) to set up his next draws. Sajgalik took advantage of the opportunity to begin to close out the game. His Geist and Angel attacked, but a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) came down to defend, targeting the [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) in his graveyard. Lee blocked the Geist and used the [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) to effectively kill the Angel, clearly a good exchange for Lee. With the way semi-clear (Lee only had two lands untapped), Sajgalik flashed in an [Aven Mindcensor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor), limiting the effectiveness of both [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) and the [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow) that was about to unsuspend. Lee tried to kill the Aven with an [Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm), but Sajgalik had a [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate). To force it through, Lee used [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to counter the [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) and draw a card.


Free to search his library, Lee resolved the [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow) and grabbed himself an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). On his turn, Sajgalik used a [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) to drive himself up to 22, forcing Lee to have eight [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s, or another [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle), to kill him. Lee played defensively with a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), giving him some temporary defense from the Finks, as well as providing him access to an eighth land. Sajgalik, meanwhile, had seven lands of his own. With access to that much mana, Sajgalik tried to force down the powerful [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), which would allow his Finks to both attack past the Elder and give him a decisive advantage. Lee confirmed that Sajgalik had only two cards left in his hand before allowing it to hit play. When Sagalik tried to equip it, and [Electrolyze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze) killed it, preventing bad things from happening for at least one more turn.


Lee sacrificed his now useless Elder, going up to eight lands. Sagjalik was tapped out, and Lee was soon going to be in worlds of trouble. Lee untapped and drew his card. For three mana, a [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within) turned the offensive Sword into a [Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast) token, which a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) killed with a [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal). Lee was on four cards in hand to Sajgalik's soon-to-be three. This was an interesting dance of control, with Sajgalik trying to find the balance between control and aggression to avoid dying to a fastball Scapeshit. On the other side, Lee was trying to stay alive and draw out as many threats and counters from Sajgalik as possible, clearing the way for his combo.


Sajgalik made a [Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft), which made it into play safely. Lee had no play for his turn, simply passing the turn back. Sajgalik used the end of Lee's turn to activate the one [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) he had drawn this game to destroy the [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle), on Lee's side. Sajgalik attacked. This forced Lee to play a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) to block the Geist, keeping him in a reasonable spot once more. The ability targeted Sajgalik, washing away his last card in hand: [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). The Angel struck true, dropping Lee to 13. At the end of the turn, Lee aimed an Electolyze at Sajgalik, dropping him to 21, making a [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) one land from lethal. Lee had an [Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm) to filter through his deck, drawing two cards and discarding two [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s before playing a second [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle). He looked to be setting up or the next turn.



![Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scalding+Tarn)

Sajgalik used a [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) to attack Lee down to 9. With one card in hand, things looked on the ropes for Sajgalik. A [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) brought back an [Electrolyze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze), dropping Sagjalik to 19, while a [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) dropped Sagjalik to a now-lethal 18. It was all according to plan, though, as Sagjalik's last card in hand was a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique), revealing two [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)s and a [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), no [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift), while Lee was tapped out. He obviously left the trio in Lee's hand, not willing to have one of them miraculously turn into a [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift).


He slowly peeled the top card of his deck. No [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). All he could do was attack for 2 and pass the turn. Sajgalik drew his card and attacked with his Clique, opting not to animate his Colonnade. Interestingly, Lee chose to bounce the Clique and draw a card rather than simply tapping it. This would allow Sajgalik to recast it and wash away a [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) if Lee had drawn it. When he tried, Lee did have the [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to counter it and draw a card. When Sajgalik revealed his last card to be a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), it looked like the Cryptic would be countered, and Sajgalik would be able to resolve his [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique).


And then, for some reason, after a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) countered the Cryptic, Sajgalik passed the turn. Without using the triggered ability from the Clique. The judge paused them during Lee's draw step, but let them continue after a beat.


Lee had done it: he had the [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). He cast it, sacrificing six lands and fetching enough [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s to finish Sajgalik off. With the triggers on the stack, the Head Judge came over for a little conference with the players about the possibility that Lee had improperly tapped his lands to cast the pair of [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)s on the previous turn. After a consultation with the table judge and both players, it was determined that even if he had (which I firmly remember him doing), he clearly had enough to properly afford it, thus the play stands. At one point during the discussion, there was an almost imperceptible "Oh..." from Sajagalik as his gaze dropped to the Clique in play. From my perspective, it seemed as though he had just realized that both players had somehow missed that trigger. In any case, the triggers resolved and Sajgalik ended up on the wrong end of eighteen damage, giving the final game of the match to Lee.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptrtr12/qf_sajgalik_lee2.jpg) *Both Sajgalik and Lee discuss with the judge over the brutal missed [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) trigger.* 
After the match, I asked Sajgalik about the [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique), and he admitted that he had simply forgotten it in the commotion of that last turn.


"I'm not sure. I certainly remembered it on the next turn, but by then there was nothing the judge could do about it. It may have been because of the counter war, but in any case, I missed it."


Lee Shi Tian defeats Eduardo Sajgalik 3-2 and advances to the Semifinals!
