As **Magic** changes, the [DCI Floor Rules](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=dci/utr/intro), a set of documents governing how **Magic** tournaments are played, adapt to the new cards and new environments created.


Part of the Floor Rules is the [Banned / Restricted List](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=judge/resources/banned), the list of famous power cards that have proved too strong or problematic to be allowed in tournament play.


The first such list was published on USENET way back in January of 1994. The full text of it is [here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=dci/downloads/FirstDCIFloorRules.txt). Let's look at just the banned / restricted list:
