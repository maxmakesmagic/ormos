*Did you ever quit **Magic**, only to return later? When, and why?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_daveguskin.jpg)**Dave Guskin:** I think nearly everyone who started back in the olden days has a story like this! For me, I started playing **Magic** in junior high but had to let it go just after my freshman year in high school. Turns out, you can't really play without opponents, and all of my school friends got into other activities so my playgroup quickly dwindled. Not that I can blame them—I got into the school newspaper and track and field at around the same time, thus leaving precious little time for [Word of Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Word+of+Command) and my [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel).

I brought my collection to college, though, thinking maybe one day I would find a kindred spirit (or three) who would be interested in picking up the game again. And I found them, in my friends Todd, Chris and Tim! One day, Todd pointed out an interesting new development during my senior year: the open public beta for a new program called **Magic Online** had just started, and I was once again hooked. I organized a game day for my dorm, which was really just cover to get people drafting. It was great fun for everyone—I think that game day reignited more than a few lapsed players—and I've been playing and drafting ever since. My college now has a **Magic** club. I didn't start the club, but I'd like to think my game day drafting experiment helped convince the eventual founders of the club that there were people looking to game!
