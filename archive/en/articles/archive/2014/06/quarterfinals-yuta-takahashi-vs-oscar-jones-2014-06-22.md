Yuta Takahashi is most well-known as a faeries master. He was the first player to construct the classic iteration of Standard faeries. Takahashi has seven Grand Prix top 8s to his name and a single Pro Tour top 8 where he lost in the finals to one of the most handsome men on the planet. There's no doubt in anyone's mind that Takahashi is very capable of winning this event.


Oscar Jones is only sixteen years old, but he's clearly a rising star in the *Magic* community. Jones finished in the Top 8 of Grand Prix Richmond, the largest Constructed *Magic* event of all time. Jones also made it to the *Magic Online* Championship. It's clear that there's a bright future ahead for this one.


**Game 1**


Takahashi won the roll and both players kept their opening hands.


[Tidebinder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage) from Jones was the first play of the game, but it had its flesh devoured by Takahashi immediately.


[Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) ensured that Oscar's draw would be smoother while also threatening to become a huge indestructible monster in the right situation.


Takahashi applied a bit of pressure with [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), and Jones could only cast [Bident of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa) to further the potential of his coming turns.


From here, Jones ran into a wall of removal spells from Takahashi. One after the next, Blue creatures found themselves being sent to the graveyard. All the while, Takahashi attacked with an ever growing army of rats.


Eventually, Jones was able to stick a [Tidebinder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage), turning on [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) and allowing him to make it unblockable to draw an extra card.


Takahashi was unphased, though, a removal spell and a [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) activation were enough to finish off his young opponent.


**Takahashi 1 - 0 Jones**

**Game 2**



Oscar had a beautiful draw in the second game of the match. Judge's Familiar countered [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and curved right into [Frostburn Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird).


Takahashi plucked a [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) from Jones's hand, but [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) came off the top and the Japanese master found himself in a precarious situation.


Hero's Downfall dealt with the [Frostburn Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird), but the race was on, and it looked like Jones was winning.


Takahashi tried to go on the offensive with [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) and [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie), but he couldn't find another removal spell and he soon found himself dead on board after getting his [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) token domesticated.


**Takahashi 1 - 1 Jones**

**Game 3**



Takahashi kept his opening seven. After some thought, Jones decided to send back an opening seven with only one land. Six cards offered up five land. Five cards offered up no land. Four was as good as it could be.


Takahashi cast [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) and got to work immediately making tokens. Jones tried to hang on, but with only four cards in his opening hand it seemed impossible to contend with the ever growing army of rats on the other side of the table.


It didn't take long before the pack of rats had consumed what remained of Jones.


**Takahashi 2 - 1 Jones**


Yuta Takahashi defeats Oscar Jones in three games to move on to the semifinals!
