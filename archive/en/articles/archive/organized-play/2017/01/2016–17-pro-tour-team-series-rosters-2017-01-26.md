 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 






The soft launch for the Pro Tour Team Series has kicked off, and 32 teams have submitted their squads and are ready to give it their all at the next three Pro Tours to see who will qualify for the Team Finals at the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship!


For more information on the Pro Tour Team Series, [head over here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/pro-tour-team-series-soft-launch-opens-2016-11-16). But here are the basics:


* Players have formed teams of six that they will compete as for the remainder of the 2016–17 season.
* Pro Points earned by the best five finishes from the team members of each team are added up at the end of each Pro Tour. That total is added to a team's score.
* The teams with the Top 2 scores at the end of the 2016–17 season (which concludes with Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation* in Kyoto, Japan, on July 28–30 later this year) will be invited to compete in the Team Finals, set to take place during the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship in Boston, Massachusetts, October 5–8.

Outside of that, the Pro Tour is still an individual competition. Players are competing to see how well they, as an individual, do at the tournament for their share of $250,000. But the Team Series rewards teams who, through their preparation for the Pro Tour, manage to put multiple team members high in the standings at the end of a Pro Tour. If a team member wins, the team is rewarded with a big team score! If multiple team members finish in the Top 8, that team is likely to have a huge lead over the rest of the field in the Team Series!


Below you'll find 32 teams that have submitted their rosters and will be represented in the 2016–17 Pro Tour Team Series.
