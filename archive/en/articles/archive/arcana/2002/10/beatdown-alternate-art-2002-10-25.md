The [Beatdown Box Set](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/expert/beatdown/welcome.asp) is probably most well-known for the two foil premium cards it contains: alternate art versions of [Erhnam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erhnam+Djinn) and [Sengir Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire).


The set also contains two little-known other alternate art cards: [Clockwork Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Beast) by Carl Critchlow and [Ball Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning) by Dave Dorman.
