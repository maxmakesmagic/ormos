The Gruul, of all of Ravnica's varied guilds, never lost touch with the wilderness. Today we take a look inside the style guide for *Guildpact* to see how they use all kinds of packbeasts and monsters for distinctively Gruul purposes.

A style guide is a document of text and reference illustrations used to guide artists who work on a **Magic** set. The concept illustrations shown in this Arcana are all by *Guildpact's* lead conceptual artist, D. Alexander Gregory.

When the Gruul raid the territories of the other guilds, they employ ferocious [Gruul Nodorog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Gruul%2BNodorog) and [Rumbling Slum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Rumbling%2BSlum) like a combination pack animal and [Battering Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Battering%2BWurm). As you can see below, some Gruul clansmen specialize in handling these raiding beasts. 

The Selesnya Conclave, as you'll [remember](/en/articles/archive/ravnica-style-guide-selesnya-2005-10-04), employs giant beasts such as [Siege Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Siege%2BWurm) as well. But the look of a Gruul wurm is much more savage and primal -- you'll find no tamed animals wearing chrome armor in this guild.

Wurms in particular are employed by the Gruul as a kind of living explosive device. Check out Chris Moeller's art on [Killer Instinct](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Killer+Instinct), depicting a wild wurm-outa-nowhere.
