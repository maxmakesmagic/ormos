Prerelease Weekend: No Premier Play
-----------------------------------


There will be no premier-level events on *Magic Online* this weekend. But there *will* be *Dominaria* Prereleases everywhere, in stores and online! *Dominaria* Sealed Deck events will be available on MTGO starting on April 20, and Draft will be available as of April 23.


Heroes old and new are gathering on Dominaria, ready to face the evils of the Multiverse. So get to a Prerelease or two—in person or online—and dig into the legendary home plane of *Magic*.


 
More Team Modern Super League
-----------------------------


Team Modern Super League is in the home stretch. Many spells have been cast, experimental decks have been tested, teams have been eliminated… but it's not over quite yet! Tune in for the last few weeks of epic Modern action.


TMSL airs Tuesdays (like this one!) at 5 p.m. PT on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about Team Modern Super League [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/tmsl-info/), or check out the video below.
