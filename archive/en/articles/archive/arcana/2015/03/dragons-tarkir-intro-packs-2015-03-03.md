Hey, have you guys heard that there might be some Dragons in *Dragons of Tarkir*? There will be. I can confirm that here. True story.



But you all might really not get the scope of how many Dragons are positively stuffed into this set. So let me give you another clue as to how positively lousy with dragons *Dragons of Tarkir* truly is. This is the first intro pack.

A Dragon. Cool, right? I mean, at least one of the Intro Packs had to have a Dragon, right?



But why stop at one?

Seriously. This set is about Dragons.



Look for the full Intro Pack decklists after previews are completed.



We can also show you the regular version of the face cards. Because who doesn't love more dragons? Even if it is more of the same dragons.
