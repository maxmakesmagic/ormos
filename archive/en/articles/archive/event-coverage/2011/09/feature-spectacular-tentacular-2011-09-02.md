[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn). The Eldrazi deity is fast becoming the end boss of Modern, finishing games in a heartbeat upon its arrival. It's the good, the bad, and the ugly all in one skyscraper-sized tentacled cloud monstrosity. Untouchably powerful and impossibly big, all the other big creatures in ****Magic**** tremble as [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) approaches, and rightly so. It's the Death Star of ****Magic**: The Gathering**, if you will.


![Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn)
[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn)'s grotesque shadow is cast over the whole of the Modern late game. In many matchups, if you get past the fourth or fifth turn then the impending doom of [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) just comes closer and closer. And he's seemingly everywhere. As much as any one card, the raw power of [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) has been enough to seduce many of the best players in the world, and they've been very creative in finding all sorts of new ways of bringing this 15/15 to the table.


Ah, [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn)—how do we love thee? Let me count the ways...


### The Hard Way


(a.k.a. "Actually Paying Fifteen Mana")


By far the most common way of playing [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) is to put together a collection of [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s and [Glimmerpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpost)s to generate a ton of colorless mana from your lands. That's at the heart of the "Twelvepost" deck that is one of the pillars of the Modern format. Using cards like [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) and [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map) players can search through their deck for the Loci and start generating mana from their [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s, which generate mana equal to the number of Loci on the battlefield. The turbo version of this deck uses the combination of [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) and [Amulet of Vigor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor) to search up the full set of [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s at once, with the Amulet ensuring that they enter the battlefield untapped and can immediately summon forth [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn)!




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Cloudpost | Glimmerpost |

One weakness for the Twelvepost decks is that they are very vulnerable to land destruction, which can easily leave them with a lonely [Glimmerpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpost) on the battlefield and [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) sitting useless in hand. The truly committed [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) devotees often add a second way of generating fifteen mana, such as a set of [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement)s. This version tends to look a lot more like the Eldrazi decks we see in Standard at the moment, but it does give the Twelvepost decks some added mana stability at the expense of stripping down most of the deck's countermagic defenses.


### The "Why Not?" Way


(a.k.a. "I Have Infinite Mana and Cards, so I Might as Well Cast [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn)")


The Elf combo deck has been chosen by around a dozen players in this Pro Tour, using the combination of [Nettle Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel) and [Heritage Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid) with a [Cloudstone Curio](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudstone+Curio) to ensure that they can generate an infinite supply of green mana. Throw an [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) into the mix and you can also draw infinite cards. Once you've done all that, it doesn't take too much imagination to decide that casting [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) is one of the more interesting things you can do when you have a gazillion mana and every card in your deck. It might be relegated to the role of a tentacled [Time Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) in the Elf deck, but the voluminous one does it very well indeed.

So, having explored all the ways of actually casting [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) for its mana cost of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413132456im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless5.gif), players then started to get creative...


### The 40% Discount Way


(a.k.a. "Buy One, Get One Free")


![Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tooth+and+Nail)
The Twelvepost decks that shun blue countermagic for more green cards are often choosing to invest in some serious discounts on their [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn), in the form of [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail). For just ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413132456im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless5.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) they can search their deck for [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) and a burly friend, or drop an [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) they were already holding onto the battlefield. Pay the added entwine cost of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif) and you can do both—search for [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) and a friend, then put them straight onto the battlefield! Paying ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152843im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless7.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) is a healthy saving on the ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413132456im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless5.gif) to cast [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) for its mana cost—a 40% discount!


### The One-Hit Wonder Way


(a.k.a. "The Breach Boys")


![Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Through+the+Breach)
A late development in the Pro Tour preparation was the buzz yesterday about Through The [Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breach), with news of the card's appearance in Twelvepost decks seeing dealers rapidly sell out of the unheralded **Champions of Kamigawa** rare. [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) cuts the cost of [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) even further than [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) does, all the way from fifteen mana to just five. In this version [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) doesn't stick around to actually finish the job, but the chances are that the one attack will do enough to win the game. That's 15 damage to the opponent and six of their permanents binned by the annihilator keyword! What could be better than that?


Well, how about our next one...


### The Old Gods Don't Die Way


(a.k.a. "It's ALIVE!!!")


One of the sneakiest ways of getting [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) onto the battlefield is probably also the quickest as it's possible to have [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) swinging into the red zone as early as the second turn! This obviously sounds a crazily good idea if you can pull it off, so what do you need to do? The first step is to get [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) into your graveyard by discarding it to cast [Lightning Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe), although obviously you'll need a handy creature to aim your Axe at. Failing that, there are any number of other draw/discard affects you can use. The important thing is to send [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) to the graveyard somehow so that you can bring it back to life.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Lightning Axe | Goryo's Vengeance |

But wait, that doesn't work—when [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) goes to the graveyard your whole graveyard gets shuffled into your deck, so how can you reanimate it? The secret is timing, as it so often is in ****Magic****. [Goryo's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance) is an instant, so once [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn)'s effect to shuffle it into your deck is on the stack, you can respond with [Goryo's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance) and wrench your dying god back into the game!


### The Top Seven Way


(a.k.a. "It's a Trap!")


![Summoning Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Summoning+Trap)
Returning to the classic green cards, it's possible to bring [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) into play for nothing. Nil. Nada. Zip. All you need is an obliging opponent, a bit of luck, and [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap). Play a creature that your opponent wants to counter, somehow sweet-talk them into countering it by assuring them that you aren't playing [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap) in your deck... then cast [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap)! They may want to call you a dirty liar as you reveal [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) in the top seven cards of your deck, but they'll be too busy running and screaming.


All that outlines the many ways that players have come up with to use and abuse one of the most powerful creatures we've ever seen in ****Magic****. But there is one more route to getting [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) into play, and it doesn't even involve having [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) in your deck to begin with...


### The Sting


(a.k.a. "I Wasn't Even Supposed to Be Here Today")


![Bribery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bribery)
[Bribery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery). ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif). Sorcery. Search your opponent's library for a creature card and put it into play under your control.


As it became obvious just how many players and decks were going to try and bring the big Eldrazi to the table, the search was on for an answer. You couldn't counter [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn), and once he was in play you rarely had time to kill him before your cards vanished from under you and the game was over. The answer to this threat was [Bribery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery), because even the Eldrazi can be bought if you bring enough gold. [Bribery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery) is appearing in the sideboards of many decks here at the Pro Tour, deciding mirror matches between Twelvepost decks, giving the control decks the perfect weapon against their biggest foe and offering all the other blue-based decks a powerful option to turn their opponent's best card against them. In a format with a card pool as large as Modern there is always going to be an answer to any deck, and the decks hoping to exploit [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) may well come to regret their decision.


We've a long way to go before we can declare Modern to be the domain of [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn), but it's certain that [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) has been one of the focal points of player creativity in the lead-up to this Pro Tour—and that we're going to see a lot of the Eldrazi behemoth before we crown our Pro Tour Philadelphia champion!
