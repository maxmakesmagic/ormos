It was all or nothing in this round - a win would allow these players to continue playing tomorrow while a loss would knock them out of the competition and end their dream of winning the Grand Prix this weekend.


For Denmark's Thomas Enevoldsen, that dream had become a reality once before; he won Grand Prix Strasbourg last year. His opponent Andrea Giotta from Italy on the other hand was still trying to bolster his resume with a similar accomplishment.




*It was Andrea Giotta's first feature match and he had to overcome a former Grand Prix Champion!*
