In honor of [Modern Masters Weekend](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/modern-masters-2015-edition), the Standard Super League is actually going to play Modern for one week. Tonight’s show should be interesting as we see what decks these guys have been looking for an excuse to try out!

Last week Owen Turtenwald became our first two-time weekly winner and took a fairly large lead in the overall standings. Abzan Control was his deck of choice and, more specifically, he started with the list that Yuuki Ichikawa used to win [Grand Prix Shanghai](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsha15) two days earlier and made only one change (cutting one copy of [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) to trim the list down to 60 cards from the 61-card version that Ichikawa won with).

Owen wasn’t the only one inspired by GP Shanghai, as Paul Cheon ran the cool new Dragon Megamorph deck that Yuuya Watanabe and Makahito Mihara used to put up [Top 16 finishes](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/top-16-decklists-2015-05-17) at that same Grand Prix. There were actually eight different decks in action last week and in four weeks of games, our eight Standard Super League players have now played a total of 25 distinct deck archetypes!
