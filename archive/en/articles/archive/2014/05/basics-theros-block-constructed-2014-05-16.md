 This is one of the richest, most intriguing Block Constructed formats in a very long time. With access to incredibly powerful cards, an abundance of incredible lands, and a number of well-supported "build around me" cards, *Theros* Block Constructed is a far more wide open field than many of us would have ever expected. As diverse as the card pool appears to allow builders and brewers to be, there are a few restrictions that it places on them as well, limitations that warp the format and draw a divisive line between the decks that have a chance from those that don't.



"I think a lot of people might have tricked themselves this tournament," Brad Nelson began. "Preparing for this event, it was really easy to come up with a suboptimal version of a deck that others might have perfected and write it off. They may have made their deck well, but when you do it with incorrect assumptions, it skews the deck. It's easy to be inbred in your testing.



 We tested a lot to come to our deck. We figured that everyone would at least be able to figure out that this was a viable deck for the format, but we think we have a better build and sideboard than most people would come up with. I think it's the best deck in the field, but it's possible that I'm wrong. It's one of those decks that's going to be either fifty percent of the field, or it's going to be like [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel), where it's the best deck in the room, but no one knows it."






*Brad Nelson has chosen to stick with what may be the most popular deck of the tournament, though he's confident that his team has found the the correct cards necessary to navigate them to victory.*
