If you have read [today's Savor the Flavor](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/57), you will have noticed a Kor Soldier token from *Zendikar*. If you haven't yet, well, there's the link right there in the sentence before this one. We'd reprint the image here, but we've got *ten other token cards* to get through first. Mixmaster *Zendikar*, whatcha got for us?

Sure, a 4/4 Angel token. I believe that goes well with [Luminarch Ascension](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/tcg/products/zendikar/il8vdg7ouz_EN.jpg).

A 1/1 flying bird. Very nice. I wonder what *Zendikar* card makes those!

Next we have a 2/2 Illusionâ€”or do we? (Yes. We do.)

You never know when you'll meet a 1/1 Merfolk. Although you're more likely to when you're already working with [Lullmage Mentor](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/tcg/products/zendikar/k3mntfewc5_EN.jpg).

Who is this mysterious vampire with the variable power and toughness? Only [Kalitas, Bloodchief of Ghet](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/tcg/products/zendikar/8htomk0ihp_EN.jpg) knows the answer!

Ooh! A Zombie Giant! And he's 5/5, which is certainly big for a zombie. So *that's* what happens when you go on a [Quest for the Gravelord](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/tcg/products/zendikar/k1kwtq5fie_EN.jpg)!

Our seventh token (go back and count!) is, fittingly enough, a 7/1 Elemental. It's really got that [Elemental Appeal](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/tcg/products/zendikar/k04zw05ish_EN.jpg).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/283_ZEN_Token8.jpg)  
What would **Magic** be without 4/4 Beasts? Thanks to [Rampaging Baloths](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/tcg/products/zendikar/m2nbdbg821_EN.jpg), we don't have to consider the terrifying possibility!

Snake. Snake? SNAAAAAAAAKE!

And finally, thanks to [Turntimber Ranger](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/tcg/products/zendikar/9dz6xkpdus_EN.jpg), we've got a 2/2 Wolf. Nice doggy!
