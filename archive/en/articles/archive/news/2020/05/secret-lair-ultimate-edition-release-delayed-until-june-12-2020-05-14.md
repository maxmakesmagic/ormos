Because of a delay in manufacturing due to COVID-19, *Secret Lair*: Ultimate Edition's release date has shifted to June 12.


This delay is certainly unfortunate, and we hope the two-week delay doesn't cause too many disruptions. We are continuing to prioritize the health and safety of our employees, partners, and players and will continue to keep you updated should any other release shifts become necessary.
