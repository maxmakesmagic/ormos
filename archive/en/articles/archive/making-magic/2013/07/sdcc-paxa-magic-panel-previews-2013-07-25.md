 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 







Last weekend, Mark Rosewater, Mark Purvis, Jenna Helland, and Dave Guskin presented the **Magic** panel at San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) and Aaron Forsythe did the same at PAX Australia. Both panels covered the same information, but provided a few different preview cards. Enough words, here is the video from SDCC!

### Hero's Path


 Let's switch gears here and talk about the Hero's Path, which Dave Guskin explained [in yesterday's feature article](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/path-hero-2013-07-24). If you go to the [*Theros* Prerelease](/en/node/648591), September 21â€“22, 2013, you'll get one of these:

 And in case you didn't know, the backs of those cards are not normal **Magic**-card backs.

Those cards will then be used at Game Day when you go against the Face the Hydra Challenge Deck, which has cards that look like...
