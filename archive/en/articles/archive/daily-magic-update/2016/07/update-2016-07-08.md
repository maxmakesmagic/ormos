The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 8, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by the full [*Eldritch Moon* Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/eldritch-moon). Though, who are we kidding? You've already read it top to bottom.


This Weekend's Must Watch
=========================


1. > 
> This Saturday at 12:00PM Pacific is the Eldritch Moon PrePreRelease! Hope to see you all there. [pic.twitter.com/ieXXXgPx4P](https://t.co/ieXXXgPx4P)
> 
> 
>  — LoadingReadyRun (@loadingreadyrun) [July 7, 2016](https://twitter.com/loadingreadyrun/status/751164081097191424)

This was a ton of fun when LoadingReadyRun hosted the Pre-Prerelease for *Shadows over Innistrad*—so why not do it again? Featuring a number of popular streamers and content producers (plus Marshall Sutcliffe), the Pre-Prerelease features actual, real-life cards, deck techs, and, above all, new cards!


Today's Must
============


1. [Beating Players Who Are Better Than You](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33249_Beating-Players-That-Are-Better-Than-You.html) | Emma Handy | StarCityGames.com

Emma Handy makes her debut on StarCityGames.com and knocks one out of the park. Not only does she explore ways to close the skill gap between yourself and better players, but she shares a number of decklists for new Standard that feature new *Eldritch Moon* standouts. It's like two articles in one!


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Cards Most Improved by *Eldritch Moon*](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13376&writer=Craig+Wescoe&articledate=7-8-2016) | TCGPlayer | Craig Wescoe

Craig Wescoe looks at the risers in Standard thanks to additions from *Eldritch Moon*. The article is deep, long, and thoroughly covers a number of cards that are going to suddenly go from very mediocre to very good.


1. [Eldritch Moonchanics](http://judgecast.com/?p=985) | JudgeCast | CJ Shrader, Bryan Prillaman, and Jess Dunks

Judges talk mechanics on a podcast for the latest set. What more do you need?


1. [My Road to Platinum](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/my-road-to-platinum/) | ChannelFireball | Pascal Maynard

Pascal Maynard rose to prominence last year as he chased the Grand Prix Master slot—but he didn't rise to Platinum. This is part one of a who-knows-how-many series detailing how he made Platinum this year, and it'll be interesting to see how the series goes.


1. [Okie Donkey](http://shoutengine.com/MagictheParenting/okie-donkey-21350) | Magic: The Parenting | Erin, Mike, and Courtney

This week's topic for the most adult of *Magic* podcasts (not like that!) is what the best formats are for kids. Also, since "kids doing grownup stuff they don't quite fully understand" is a tried and true way to get a few "awws" and laughs, they have a segment where their daughter reviews a planeswalker. Kids sure do say the darndest things.


Zombies Just Wanna Have Fu-un
=============================


1. [*Eldritch Moon*—Become a Zombie in Four Steps!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ46OQRIykM) | Wizards of the Coast

Hey, that's us! Actually, our European offices put this together and I thought it was cool. Zombies step up in a big way in *Eldritch Moon*, so if you want to dress up as one for your Prerelease—or, you know, just to freak people out in everyday life—check out this how-to video.

What (Else) To Watch This Weekend
=================================


1. [StarCityGames.com Worcester Open Weekend](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/090716_worcester_fact_sheet.html)

The Pre-Prerelease can only take so long, so why not fill the other hours of your weekend with the StarCityGames.com Worcester Open, featuring Legacy. Check out coverage starting at 10:30 a.m. ET/7:30 a.m. PT on [twitch.tv/scglive](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive) and watch Chris VanMeter and Andrew Boswell deal with the ridiculous spelling of a town pronounced "Wooster." They'll probably also talk about Legacy.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Are there any LGBT characters that are going to be depicted on cards in *Eldritch Moon*? I've noticed a few people are very upset that we haven't seen any mention of Hal and Alena getting card(s).](http://wizardsmagic.tumblr.com/post/147050385131/are-there-any-lgbt-characters-that-are-going-to-be)

This was *the* question we were getting on Tumblr yesterday, and the answer has a ton of good information in it. Plus the ol' "more to come" teaser that always raises a few eyebrows when people start speculating about future cards and sets. Kimberly Kreines (one of our creative types who takes point on *Magic Story*) was asked a few more questions on Twitter about it as well, a conversation you can see in full, posted on [Tumblr here](http://keranos-god-of-storm-crows.tumblr.com/post/147080324752/in-case-yall-were-wondering-what-hal-and-alena).


Decks of the Day
================


1. [Brewing Sultai with Emrakul and *Eldritch Moon*](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/brewing-sultai-with-emrakul-and-eldritch-moon/) | ChannelFireball | Brian DeMars

Brian DeMars has a number of Sultai lists in this list for the new-deck connoisseur, including a Standard "dredge" deck and a deck that aims to cast Emrakul, the Promised End on the cheap. Now where did I put that [Tormod's Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt)?
