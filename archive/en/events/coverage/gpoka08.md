![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpoka08/blurb_end.jpg) 2006 World Champion Makihito Mihara won Grand Prix Okayama with an Esper deck that boasted three copies of Sanctum Gargoyle and a pair of the Tower variety. He was one of only two Esper drafters in a Top 8 that was stretched thin for green, white, and red playables as evidenced by his finals opponent, Kazuya Mitamura’s decision to play Ooze Garden and Keeper of Progenitus in his main deck.


The Top 8 featured the former World Champion, Pro Tour Yokohama finalists Mitamura and Guillaume Wafo-Tapa, Mitamura’s PT Charleston teammate Chikara Nakajima, two-time Pro Tour Top 8 competitor Tsuyoshi Ikeda, and Hall of Famer Olivier Ruel. Between them they sported a total of 15 Pro Tour Top 8 appearances and dozens and dozens of Grand Prix Top 8s.


Coming into the Top 8 Olivier Ruel had hoped to close some ground on Shuhei Nakamura in the Player of the Year race. Shuhei finished in the Top 16 earning 3 points but Olivier was only able to gain a single point in the race when he was defeated by Nakajima in the quarterfinals.
