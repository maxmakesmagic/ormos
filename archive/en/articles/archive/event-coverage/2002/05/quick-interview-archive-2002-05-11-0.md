**"If you were to play in Nationals today, what Standard deck would you use?"**

| **Antoine Ruel:** Frog in a Blender | **Akira Asahara:** "UG Psychatog Madness." |  **Masaya Mori:** "UG Psychatog Madness." |

**"Why do Japanese teams change their roster so much?"**



|  |  |  |

|  |  |  |
| **藤田剛史:** "Everyone's looking for a consistent combination." | **Masahiko Morita:** "Usually because everyone gets into a big argument after an event and breaks up." | **Itaru Ishida:** "Most Japanese players have so many friends, they figure they can team up with anyone they know. Of course, that means it's hard to develop as a team." |

**"Who is currently the best player in Japan?"**

| **Olivier Ruel:** "Jin Okamoto" | **Alex Shvartsman:** "That's a difficult question to answer. I'd have to go with Katsuhiro Mori, simply because he has the best results on the Pro Tour. Still, it's a tough choice with Jin Okamoto and Tsuyoshi Fujita both performing consistently well, and you can't forget about Panzer Hunters either." | **Sam Lau:** "Katsuhiro Mori. It's intimidating to play against him because he's so fast." |
