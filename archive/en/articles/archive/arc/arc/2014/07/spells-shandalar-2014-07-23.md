The Spells of Shandalar

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






Last week, [we met the denizens of Shandalar](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/welcome-shandalar-2014-07-16), a plane that plays a central role in both *Magic 2015* and *Magic 2015*—*Duels of the Planeswalkers* (not to mention the classic MicroProse computer game released in 1997).


But as anyone who has dared to enter any of those game worlds can attest, the locals can be restless, talented mages themselves, slinging some of the more exotic and dangerous spells in the Multiverse.


So let's once again take a trip through the Multiverse (Wizards of the Coast's super-secret database of all things *Magic*) to discover the spells and artifacts of Shandalar to get a taste of just what dangers you might encounter from each of the five colors of *Magic*.


White


Shandalar holds many enchantments in white, but also places great emphasis on white's ability to swarm the opponent. Small creatures tend to return to their ranks on Shandalar, often marked with honor and protected by the bonds forged with their ancestors.

Blue


Little is as it seems when blue mages are around on Shandalar. Scissors may leap up and attack, the mightiest herds may suddenly turn to a colony of frogs, and sudden storms or temporal setbacks may sweep creatures back in time.

Black


The dead don't stay dead on Shandalar, especially not when black mages are around to unmake death itself or to force obedience for all time. Then again, the living don't stay living very long either, either stuck in some caustic tar, downed by ulcers, or caught in the wake of a certain Planeswalker hunting bigger game.

Red


Like much of the Multiverse, red mages on Shandalar act on their impulses; they can be aggressive, even in their mining activities; and are often seething with anger. Plus, hammerhands and inferno fists all over the place. Apparently Shandalarians like punching with fire.

Green


Shandalar's more natural tendencies tend to revolve around various creatures and animals, and the few spells they wield highlight that fact, ambushing nongreen creatures and sacrificing life to promote future growth.

Artifact


Finally, artificers on Shandalar have created a number of toys to play with—or been struck by them falling from above. Plates and gloves send Shandalarians into battle well equipped, while an obelisk from Urd can buttress entire armies. Just watch out for meteorites and the machines of tyrants.
