It was a battle of the old and new faces of American **Magic**, as reigning U.S. Champ Luis Scott-Vargas faced off against David Williams, poker celebrity and gamer for life. Both were off to a great 3-0 start, Williams with the breakout Storm deck and LSV with Big Red-Green.


### Game 1


LSV won the die roll and kept his opener. Williams went down to six.


"Always good to start out with a mulligan," said Williams as he shuffled up.


"Or two..." chimed in R&D's Erik Lauer, spectating.


"If I mulligan again, you're out of here. It's bad enough I have the black cat [**Magic Online** honcho Worth Wollpert] standing over my shoulder watching me draw it." He grinned.

His six were acceptable, and they were off. Williams led with a pair of [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom)s and [Spinerock Knoll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spinerock+Knoll). He waited and charged his lands while LSV got [Highland Weald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highland+Weald) with [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North), then [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) and a [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots). Williams [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)ed the planeswalker down to 2 loyalty, slowing down any potential [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)s. Not that it mattered, since LSV was missing attackers.


He tried to assemble a team, but with no disruption he was just waiting for Williams to blow him up. The two Blooms came off suspend.


Luis Scott Vargas: "Am I dead?"


Dave Williams: "I think so."


He drew his card.


"You are now."


He played out [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath), [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock), and [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot), then showed the [Dragonstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstorm) that was hiding, appropriately enough, under the Knoll.


Williams 1, Scott-Vargas 0


### Game 2


LSV gamely sideboarded, but knew that the skewed matchup wasn't going to improve.

This time, Williams had two hideaways ready to dig up some dynamite. Scott-Vargas played out [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) and a very sad 0/1 [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). LSV himself was also sad-faced, despite his whimsical hat. He made plays on the hope that somehow Williams hadn't assembled a kill, but of course he had. Seven damage freed [Dragonstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstorm) for the win.


Williams 2, Scott-Vargas 0
