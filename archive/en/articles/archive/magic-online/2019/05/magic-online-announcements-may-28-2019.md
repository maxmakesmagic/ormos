*Modern Horizons*: *Magic Online* Edition
-----------------------------------------


*Modern Horizons* events start in two weeks on June 6, at 10 a.m. PT. You'll be able to play in Draft Leagues, Sealed Leagues, and Phantom Draft Leagues, and we're introducing a new entry option specifically for this set: *Modern Horizons* Tokens. This release will also include Treasure Chest updates, which you can view [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info) in the coming weeks.


Check out [Chris's release article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/state-magic-online-modern-horizons-play-lobby-2019-05-23) for additional info on entry options, *Modern Horizons* tokens, and more.

New Play Lobby
--------------


We're also launching our new Play Lobby alongside the release of *Modern Horizons*. This update puts a focus on formats over event types. Rather than selecting a bunch of filters and cycling through countless event types, you'll instead click the new Constructed or Limited lobby, choose your format, and be shown everything available in that format.


You can find more information about the new Play Lobby [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/state-magic-online-modern-horizons-play-lobby-2019-05-23).

Vintage Cube Until June 6
-------------------------


That's right! Vintage Cube is almost back, and it's nothing like any other cube out there. It's simply overflowing with iconic cards from *Magic*'s entire 25-year history, and you can draft the super-deck of your dreams now until June 6.


To see the full card list and most recent changes, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist).

Team Modern Super League
------------------------


The newest Super League season is here with the return of the Team Modern format! Eight teams (including Wizards' Play Design group) will battle over 13 weeks for bragging rights in Modern. The broadcast begins at 6 p.m. PT every Tuesday at [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).
