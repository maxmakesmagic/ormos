The leader of the Rakdos Cult is a demon named Rakdos, which is easy to remember. When Rakdos first appeared in the *Dissension* set, it was as [Rakdos the Defiler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+the+Defiler):

In the time since the original *Ravnica: City of Guilds* block, many things have changed in the world of Ravnica. But Rakdos is still around! This time, he's [Rakdos, Lord of Riots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%2C+Lord+of+Riots).
