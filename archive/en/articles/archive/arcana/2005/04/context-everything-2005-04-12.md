M**agic** is a game of context.

Over the years Magic Arcana has touched on the concepts of "[functionally identical](/en/articles/archive/something-old-something-new-2003-04-18)" (a card that, while not a strict reprint of another card, differs from it only in irrelevant characteristics) and "[strictly better](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-playtest-cards-iii-strictly-better-2003-11-13)" (a card that does more than another card for the exact same cost). But as **Magic** grows, context changes, and so do these concepts.

Emphasis on creature type in *Onslaught* block, and spiritcraft in Kamigawa block, is one way that **Magic** has expanded its context. During the *Odyssey* days, the difference between [Dusk Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+Imp) (Creature—Imp) and *Mirage's* 
[Feral Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Shadow) (Creature—Nightstalker) was almost nil. 

However, some recent near-reprints have made quite a bit of difference. Consider:

* **[Uktabi Orangutan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Orangutan) -[Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman):** Both Elf *and* Shaman are useful creature types nowadays
* **[Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) -[Thought Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Courier):** The Courier has the more useful Wizard creature type nowadays, since Merfolk are in decline
* **[Suntail Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suntail+Hawk) -[Lantern Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+Kami):** The kami works with spiritcraft; and interestingly, these cards are both in Standard right now, allowing you to play 8 1-mana flyers in White Weenie decks
* **[Horned Turtle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horned+Turtle) -[River Kaijin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Kaijin):** Only one of these triggers [Sire of the Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sire+of+the+Storm)
* **[Merfolk of the Pearl Trident](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+of+the+Pearl+Trident) -[Fugitive Wizard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fugitive+Wizard) -[Wandering Ones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wandering+Ones):** Blue always seems to have a 1/1 vanilla creature for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) hanging around, but it matters a lot which you play, depending on whether you have [Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis), [Voidmage Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voidmage+Prodigy), or [Soul of Magma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Magma) already on the board!

![Graphic Violence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Graphic+Violence)*Unhinged* further expanded that context when it introduced "name matters," "flavor text matters" and "artist matters" cards. [Ekundu Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ekundu+Griffin) and [Razorfoot Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin) may be functionally identical to a [Callous Oppressor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Callous+Oppressor), but only one gets +2/+2 and trample after you cast [Graphic Violence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graphic+Violence) naming David A. Cherry!
