This guy has been popping out of boosters since the inception of **Magic**: 

![Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Llanowar+Elves)So it's only right that, for this year's return of [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) to the [Core Set](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/expansion/9e), their look be consistent with Anson Maddocks's original piece.

Here's Kev Walker's sketch and final art for the updated [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves).

Compare that with the look of other elves from the forests of Llanowar. Here are [Nomadic Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomadic+Elf), [Llanowar Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Knight) and [Llanowar Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elite).
