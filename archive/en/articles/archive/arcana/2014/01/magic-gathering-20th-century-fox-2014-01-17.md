Magic: The Gathering & 20th Century Fox
=======================================



 Posted in **Arcana**

You might have heard it already but let's remove any doubt about it:  

 



> **LOS ANGELES, Calif. & PAWTUCKET, R.I. January 14, 2014** -- Twentieth Century Fox and Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ: HAS) have joined forces to make a series of films based upon Hasbro’s Wizards of the Coast’s fantasy-adventure property, *MAGIC: THE GATHERING*. Simon Kinberg (*X-Men: Days of Future Past*), whose Genre Films banner is based on the Fox Lot, will serve as the franchise’s creative steward and produce in close partnership with Hasbro.



The above paragraph is taken from [yesterday's big press release](http://company.wizards.com/content/twentieth-century-fox-and-hasbro-develop-magic-gathering-new-film-franchise) concerning the news around the development of the Magic film franchise. The truth is, movie making and Magic making have a lot of things in common, from creative to story to lots of pieces coming together to form a whole, and the long lead time involved in creating the final product.


All of us at Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro are very excited about this new partnership and this big first step being taken!
