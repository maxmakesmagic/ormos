Drafting an utterly elegant Orzhov Aggro deck in the Top 8 here in Yokohama, Kitayama was able to take advantage of a colony of one- and two-mana extort creatures to effectively drain his opponents dry on his way to securing victory this weekend.


These past few weeks have seen a tremendous string of firsts for **Magic**, from some incredible high profile Top 8s at the Pro Tour to the earth-shattering attendance numbers at Grand Prix Charlotte. Continuing that trend, 2281 players showed up to play *Gatecrash* Sealed Deck here at Grand Prix Yokohama, making it the second-largest **Magic** tournament ever held, and the largest in Japanese history. Large fields can be daunting, but none handled the massive scale of this event better than Masaya Kitayama. Previously the Japanese National Champion, Kitayama arrived at his Quarterfinals with a beautiful example of the Aggro Orzhov archetype, but his road was not destined to be easy.


After an intense first game in the Quarterfinals, Kitayama dropped the second due to a poor mana draw before decimating a poor draw from his opponent. In the semifinals, he had yet another nail-biter, losing the first game to Sam Black before winning an incredibly complex second game that Black called a "great game of **Magic**." Ultimately dispatching Black after a poor mana draw in the final game, Kitayama advanced to the finals, where he once again took the match to a third game. In the end, it was his extort creatures that truly defined his victory, grinding opponents down and lifting him up as the Champion of Grand Prix Yokohama 2013, the second-largest **Magic** tournament in history!
