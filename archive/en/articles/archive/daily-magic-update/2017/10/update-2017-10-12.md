The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 12, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Treasure Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Map). X does indeed mark the spot.


Today's Must
============


1. [*Ixalan* Flavor Gems](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/snacktimewithmikeandant-10122017-snack-time-58-ixalan-flavor-gems/) | Snack Time | Gathering Magic | Ant Tessitore and Mike Linnemann

The Flavor Gems podcast is always one of my favorite episodes of Snack Time, as Mike and Ant explore the best-of-the-best flavorful cards in a new set. And *Ixalan* is a set packed with a lot of flavor.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Blue-Black Control at Worlds](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/kelvin-chew/blue-black-control-at-worlds) | MTG Mint Card | Kelvin Chew

A bare-bones, no-wasted-words look at Chew's version of Blue-Black Control that he took to the Top 4 of the World Championship. He has a bit of a different take on the deck than the Sam Black/Gerry Thompson/Josh Utter-Leyton contingent did, which makes this an interesting read.


1. [Don't Trust the Worlds Metagame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvxgKGFw3rk) | ChannelFireball | Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa

We see this every year at this tournament—it's a small field, the players all know each other, they test in groups that represent an eighth to a sixth of the field and, well, don't take my word for it. Listen to a guy who actually played in the event.

1. [[MTG] Esper Tokens | Deck Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuDjOEuTQZo) | TCGplayer | Brian Braun-Duin

Come for the sweet deck, stay for lines like "This deck is a B-B-Delight."


There have been a number of [Anointed Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointed+Procession)/[Hidden Stockpile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Stockpile) decks, but [Legion's Landing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legion%27s+Landing) has pushed the decks into the realm of playability. Plus, our friend [Treasure Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Map) makes an appearance, which is quickly becoming the [Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer) of the set for me.


1. [Politics with the Professor – What Kind of Player Are You?](https://collected.company/2017/10/11/politics-professor-kind-player-182/) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

The Professor swings by The Command Zone to talk politics in multiplayer Commander and why you should basically never listen to what anyone says in a four-player game. They're all liars. Liars I say! But not me. You can trust me.


1. [*Ixalan* Archetype Deep Dive](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-410-ixalan-archetype-deep-dive/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

Having trouble with *Ixalan*? Marshall and Luis have got you. Sailing through *Ixalan* with no troubles? You can still listen to the podcast. That's allowed.


1. [One and Fun: Tutors Needed, Apply Within!](http://puremtgo.com/articles/one-and-fun-tutors-needed-apply-within) | PureMTGO | Joshua Claytor

Claytor called it! Claytor has been pointing to several of the cards banned in 1v1 Commander for a while, and takes a bit of a victory lap after [Monday's announcement](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/166220048834/mtgo-commander-1v1-banned-announcement). Oh, he also talks about the implications for the format and all that.


What People Are Talking About

ChannelFireball's new lineup for the new season is set with plenty of familiar faces. The best thing about this video, by the way, is the burn aimed at Luis Scott-Vargas at the end.

While we're at it, Cardhoarder announced a new lineup for them as well with Team Cardhoarder Brazil! No one gets trolled in this announcement, but it's still worth checking out.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. Shock Puppet


> 
> Up to 42-13 in Comp Leagues with not a single losing league among the 11. Trying Binding out, but not sure if we will keep it. [#ShockPuppet](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShockPuppet?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/uBAsHLtghS](https://t.co/uBAsHLtghS)

Ever since *Ixalan* came out with all its highly sacrificial Treasure, Conley Woods has been working on a [Marionette Master](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marionette+Master) deck. That deck, by the tenor of Conley's tweets and his impressive record, has finally congealed into something potentially very real. I've played around with [Treasure Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Map) a bit myself, and against anything but the fastest decks, it's a very real card. [Tezzeret the Schemer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret+the+Schemer), meanwhile, has never been better than when [Treasure Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Map) and [Spell Swindle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Swindle) can spew out tokens at a moment's notice.


Which leads to the hidden gem, [Marionette Master](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marionette+Master). With just a few pieces of Treasure on the table, [Marionette Master](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marionette+Master) can turn lethal fast. One [Treasure Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Map) flip plus [Marionette Master](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marionette+Master) is 12 damage with no other help. Throw in a Tezzeret +1 and a single [Renegade Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renegade+Map), and that's 20 damage, easy.


I'm excited to try this out, if for no other reason than all the durdling I can do with [Hidden Stockpile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Stockpile), [Contraband Kingpin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contraband+Kingpin), and [Treasure Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Map).
