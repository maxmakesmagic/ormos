*Battle for Zendikar* Prerelease Events come to *Magic Online* beginning Friday, October 9!

**Face Unnatural Disaster** 


Return to the wild plane of Zendikar, where the monstrous Eldrazi threaten the entire world with destruction. The plane’s inhabitants, and even the land itself, stand united to oppose them. Answer the call and join the battle for Zendikar!


**Prerelease Events—Friday, October 9–Monday, October 12**


* [Swiss Draft](#preswissdraft)
* [Friendly Sealed](#friendlysealed)
* [Competitive Sealed](#competitivesealed)

Starting Friday, October 9, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific (UTC-7), players can journey to *Magic Online* for *Battle for Zendikar* events! Take a stroll through the lush landscapes of Zendikar before they're devoured by a legion of tentacled titans in a [Prerelease Swiss Draft](#preswissdraft). Participation in this event is one of the paths to obtaining the Kiora, Master of the Depths Avatar that's exclusive to Prerelease Events—the other route is through Prerelease Sealed events!


Prerelease Sealed events come in [Friendly Sealed](#friendlysealed) and [Competitive Sealed](#competitivesealed) versions. Think of Friendly Sealed events as showing up to a tournament full of Allies, whereas Competitive Sealed are all Eldrazi—competition will be more fierce but the rewards will be worth it! Prepare yourself—we're doing Sealed Events a little different than we have the past few sets.


We're simplifying event entry for *Battle for Zendikar* Prerelease Sealed events. The first difference is that there won't be any entry objects required to enter into a *Magic Online* Prerelease—just show up at the Limited Queues and enter from there with either Event Tickets or Play Points. Second, upon entering a Prerelease Event, players will receive six *Battle for Zendikar* booster packs and one *Battle for Zendikar* Prerelease premium rare or mythic, instead of the seeded boosters that we've offered in the past.


Get your fill of Prerelease events and Bonus Packs while you can, because they won't be available any longer once *Battle for Zendikar* Release events begin on Monday, October 12 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific (UTC -7).


**Release Events—Monday, October 12–Wednesday, October 28**


* [4-3-2-2 Single Elimination Draft](#4322draft)
* [Fast-Build 8-4 Single Elimination Draft](#84draft)
* [Pack-per-Win Swiss Draft](#ppwdraft)
* [Release Swiss Sealed](#releasesealed)
* [64-Player Single Elimination Draft with Top 8](#64playerdraft)
* [Swiss Sealed with Top 8](#swisssealed)

Release Events begin at 10:00 a.m. Pacific (UTC-7) on Monday, October 12 and run through the Wednesday, October 28, downtime.


For Draft fans, there's the [Pack-per-Win Swiss Draft](#ppwdraft), the [Fast-Build 8-4 Single Elimination Draft](#84draft), and the [4-3-2-2 Single Elimination Draft](#4322draft)—all available in the Limited Queues Room. As a heads up, the 8-4 Single Elimination Draft is set to be a fast-build event, meaning that players will have five minutes to build their decks once the last booster pack is passed. That means the 8-4 Draft and the Release [64-Player Single Elimination Event](#64playerdraft) are both great options for players who are more familiar with *Battle for Zendikar*.


If it's Sealed you're after, players can try out the [Release Swiss Sealed](#releasesealed) event in the Limited Queues, or head over to the Scheduled Events room for the high-stakes [*Battle for Zendikar* Release Swiss Sealed](#swisssealed) Event. Participation in any Release event will get players a Gideon, Ally of Zendikar Avatar!


Much like the denizens of Zendikar, Prerelease and Release events are being voraciously consumed and won't be around forever, so enjoy them while they're here on *Magic Online*!
