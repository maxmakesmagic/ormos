Somewhere around 2 AM one hundred and twenty eight players will earn the dubious right to sleep a mere six hours and come back to fight for the Top Eight.

 Stick around for more news of the last round and the 128 heroes that made the cut of the biggest Grand Prix ever. Or at least to check the name of the poor soul who finishes in 129. Now that... that has to hurt. A lot.

Stick around, and we will bring you all the late-breaking action right here.
