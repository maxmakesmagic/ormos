Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 





The Dragons of Tarkir prerelease is less than a week away at this point. Everyone is salivating over their first opportunity to play with the new set. The new cycle of elder dragons are among the most exciting and anticipated cards. I managed to sit down with a flight of known dragon lovers to ask about their favorite Elder Dragon.



**Chris Fennell on Dragonlord Ojutai**

“Dragonlord Ojutai is my favorite of the Elder Dragon cycle. See, I’m always playing from behind and a gigantic hexproof creature is exactly what I need to be doing on turn five to stay in a game. In Limited, the card combos really nicely with things like [Refocus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Refocus) and I’m really excited about making that play a reality. In Standard, the only card that effectively deals with this in a positive way is Elspeth, Sun’s Champion. The card just seems incredibly good.”

“Dragonlord Dromoka is an uncounterable [Baneslayer Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel) that’s also a Grand Abolisher. The card is very difficult for any deck to attack into and it’s capable of winning races in most spots. I can’t wait to use this with Dromoka’s Command to fight things and gain a ton of life.”

“I always loved [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation) and the prospect of stealing planeswalkers and activating them is pretty exciting. It’s always taking the opponent’s best card and it’s easy to protect it with discard and countermagic, especially if we’re able to untap. Blue/Black has traditionally been the best two-color combination in Magic and this card is the perfect finisher. The card is quite good on board too. Being a 3/5 is just about perfect for the current format; Dragonlord Silumgar has a small enough front end to live through Elspeth, Sun’s Champion and a big enough back end to live through Stoke the Flames. As a 3/5 Deathtouch, it beats Siege Rhino, Stormbreath Dragon, and blocks [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) if our opponent taps out for it.”



  
**Sam Pardee on Dragonlord Kolaghan**

“Giving everything haste is probably about as good as protection from white. If we want to be playing with [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) then we definitely want to be playing with this. This card may make Black/Red control strategies relevant in Standard. [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) is a very good removal spell and this dodges it completely while ending the game very fast. I’m just imagining games where we can cast turn three Kolaghan Monument, turn four Crux of Fate, and this on turn five, which seems like it could be pretty difficult to beat.”



  
**Matt Nass Dragonlord Atarka**

“As someone who is well-versed in creating large amounts of green mana, Dragonlord Atarka is an easy card to love. [Bogardan Hellkite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bogardan+Hellkite) was a fine card and this cost less mana and gives us a bigger body. It’s often hard to justify a card like this because of the popularity of spot removal at a given time, but the ability to divide five damage mitigates the tempo loss suffered here. [Frontier Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frontier+Siege) could also become a good card because it curves so nice into this.”
