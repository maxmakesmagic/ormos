Round 11: Feature Match - Nico Bohny vs. Matteo Versari
-------------------------------------------------------


*by Tobi Henke* 

Yesterday, Nico Bohny was positively on fire. So was his opponent, Matteo Versari. Both the Swiss pro and the Italian enjoying his first breakout performance went 10-0 with their Sealed Decks. Who would continue the undefeated streak in Draft?


### Game One


Versari won the die-roll and chose to play first. He had [Avacyn's Pilgrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Pilgrim) on turn one, followed by [Orchard Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orchard+Spirit) on turn two, and [Ulvenwald Mystics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulvenwald+Mystics) on turn three. In the meantime, Bohny's blue-white deck had given him [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice) and [Silverchase Fox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverchase+Fox). Versari used [Prey Upon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon) to have his [Ulvenwald Mystics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulvenwald+Mystics) and Bohny's 2/2 fight, then attacked with the 3/3. Bohny blocked, trading away his [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice) for the [Ulvenwald Mystics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulvenwald+Mystics) that had already taken 2 damage in the fight with [Silverchase Fox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverchase+Fox).


Versari restocked with [Villagers of Estwald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villagers+of+Estwald) and continued to beat down with his [Orchard Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orchard+Spirit). Bohny summoned [Makeshift Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mauler) and, when Versari didn't make a play on his turn to transform [Villagers of Estwald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villagers+of+Estwald) into [Howlpack of Estwald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howlpack+of+Estwald), used [Slayer of the Wicked](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slayer+of+the+Wicked) to get rid of it. He lost his [Makeshift Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mauler) to an ambush by the aptly-named [Ambush Viper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambush+Viper).



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/fm11_bohny.jpg)
*Nico Bohny*

Versari made another [Ulvenwald Mystics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulvenwald+Mystics), Bohny summoned [Fortress Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortress+Crab). Versari cast [Grizzled Outcasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzled+Outcasts) and attacked, putting Bohny at 12. Ironically, Bohny's blue-white deck seemed unprepared to deal with [Orchard Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orchard+Spirit). At end of turn, he dug for answers via [Forbidden Alchemy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy). He found [Dearly Departed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dearly+Departed) and, for his trouble, got a [Grasp of Phantoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Phantoms) into his graveyard as well.


He cast the 5/5 flier, then on his next turn returned [Grizzled Outcasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzled+Outcasts) to the top of Versari's library and began the beatdown. Versari had another [Orchard Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orchard+Spirit), but Bohny's [Claustrophobia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Claustrophobia) and [Bonds of Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonds+of+Faith) stopped Versari's offense, while [Dearly Departed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dearly+Departed) claimed victory.


Matteo Versari 0 â€“ 1 Nico Bohny


### Game Two


Bohny had basically the same start with [Silverchase Fox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverchase+Fox) and [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice), while his opponent had to make do with [Ulvenwald Mystics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulvenwald+Mystics) as his first spell of the game. Bohny returned the Mystics via [Grasp of Phantoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Phantoms) and attacked, Versari replayed it.




![Silverchase Fox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Silverchase+Fox)
![Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice)

![Ulvenwald Mystics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ulvenwald+Mystics)
![Grasp of Phantoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grasp+of+Phantoms)

Bohny's offensive (a 1/2 and a 2/2) had not been very impressive in the first place, now it was stuck. He took to the air with [Chapel Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chapel+Geist), but Versari's [Geistcatcher's Rig](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistcatcher%27s+Rig) put a stop to that as well. A second copy of [Ulvenwald Mystics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulvenwald+Mystics) joined its brethren on the battlefield, as did a Darkticket Wolf. Meanwhile, Bohny made a [Fortress Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortress+Crab), and put [Bonds of Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonds+of+Faith) on the [Geistcatcher's Rig](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistcatcher%27s+Rig). Both [Ulvenwald Mystics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulvenwald+Mystics) turned into [Ulvenwald Primordials](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulvenwald+Primordials), but Bohny clogged up the board further with [Skaab Goliath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skaab+Goliath), followed by a second [Fortress Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortress+Crab). There was no getting through, for neither player.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/fm11_versari.jpg)
*Matteo Versari*

As if on cue, both found a possible solution: Bohny had [Moorland Haunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moorland+Haunt), Versari had [Orchard Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orchard+Spirit). Bohny used his land and his [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice) to turn his [Fortress Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortress+Crab) into a 2/2 Homunculus token and a 1/1 [Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit) token with flying. The second [Fortress Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortress+Crab) ended up the same way, and the two fliers began to work on Versari's lifetotal.


It took a while to finally get there, but the combo of [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice) plus [Moorland Haunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moorland+Haunt) did indeed get there.


**Matteo Versari 0 â€“ 2 Nico Bohny (now on 11-0)**

Sunday, 10:48 a.m. - Drafting with Lucas Florent
------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby* 

As I was circulating the room this morning looking for a good drafter to watch in the first pod of Grand Prix Milan *Innistrad* draft, I found myself speaking to Christian Calcano, a pro known for his love of 40 card decks, looking for a scoop.


"I like the format a lot, but haven't done all that many drafts just yet. If you want to see some nice *Innistrad* drafting, you should speak to Lucas Florent. He was destroying yesterday in side drafts, and finished 9-1, yesterday."



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/Drafting%20with%20Lucas%20Florent.jpg)

Florent definitely seems to be comfortable drafting with the set already, and after a brief morning 'bonjour' to his countryman Raphael Levy, two seats to his right, he was all set to go.


This draft format, with its double faced cards, has some of the most interesting signalling opportunities of any set ever made. While normally one might have a hunch of the colours that anyone else at the table is or isn't drafting, it can be hard to know for sure. With flip cards, the potential for information (or misinformation) about the colours that someone is in is very high indeed.


Florent is very much of the opinion that flip cards have a big impact on the information game being played in a draft. You can use them to signal what your draft plan is, or to hide it, and even if you aren't picking them, you can certainly be influenced by them. For example, if you saw a [Reckless Waif](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Waif) opened a few seats to your right in pack one, that might influence you to pick an aggressive red card first, knowing that there would be a good chance of getting the wolf as a third pick.



![Reckless Waif](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reckless+Waif)

At the start of the first pack, it was clear that most players wouldn't be windmill slamming a flip card as a first pick. However, there were two that stood out as noteworthy â€“ Raph Levy had opened a [Ludevic's Test Subject](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ludevic%27s+Test+Subject), while opposite him there was a [Kruin Outlaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kruin+Outlaw). For Florent, the choice would not be his flip card, as there were far more interesting options. Blue held both [Battleground Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battleground+Geist) and [Stitched Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake), and red offered just one gem; a [Brimstone Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimstone+Volley). The burn spell can kill a large amount of the creatures in the format without morbid, but with it there is little that it can't handle. The flip cards did influence Florent though. Seeing that [Kruin Outlaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kruin+Outlaw) was almost exactly opposite him at the table reinforced his feeling that the red pick would be a good one, as the werewolf player would put people off red on the other side of the table, but he would be far away enough not to be affected. At the end of the first pick it was clear that the lure of both the Test Subject and the Outlaw was enough to make them worthy initial choices. Werewolf sighted.



![Ludevic's Test Subject](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ludevic%27s+Test+Subject)
![Kruin Outlaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kruin+Outlaw)

A second pick [Slayer of the Wicked](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slayer+of+the+Wicked) for Florent was a welcome addition, that had the Frenchman thinking about green/white humans, splashing for the Volley. Removal for the first two picks is a fair start, right? For the third, Florent took an [Unburial Rites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites), still waivering on colours. The thought of getting back a [Slayer of the Wicked](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slayer+of+the+Wicked) a few times seemed, frankly, a little bit wicked itself, but it did mean passing an [Into the Maw of Hell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Maw+of+Hell), and going into a third colour that meant a new plan.



![Slayer of the Wicked](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Slayer+of+the+Wicked)
![Unburial Rites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Unburial+Rites)

At the fourth pick, Florent had the choice between [Screeching Bat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Bat) or [Chapel Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chapel+Geist). Florent preferred the Geist, not just for its ability to fight well in the air, but for the added value he got from passing the flip card and seeing who snapped it up. When he saw it go the very next pick, he knew that there might be some issues with not getting too many black cards in pack two. This wasn't enough to stop [Diregraf Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Ghoul) joining Florent's squad the very next pick.



![Chapel Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chapel+Geist)
![Diregraf Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Diregraf+Ghoul)

Soon after, Lucas played another flip card trick â€“ he picked a [Villagers of Estwald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villagers+of+Estwald) from an otherwise unexciting pack. This would either be a move from him to get into green, given that things seemed to be drying up fast for him, or a neat little bluff, depending on how the pack went. As it turns out, at the end of pack one, Florent had a fairly fragmented draft deck, whose colours were yet to be fully hammered down. Was he being cut?


The answer came in pack two. He saw lots of copies of [Thraben Sentry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Sentry), which would be as useful to him as a signal of who was in white as they would be in his deck. Seeing that the player on his right took one, along with one two to his left, he knew that there might be a squeeze going on. That said, [Morkrut Banshee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morkrut+Banshee) was the best card for Florent, who gradually settled into being black/white over the course of the pack. He picked up more [Diregraf Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Ghoul)'s and [Abbey Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abbey+Griffin)s over the course of the pack, and finally gave a signal to the table in picking a [Cloistered Youth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloistered+Youth).



![Diregraf Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Diregraf+Ghoul)
![Abbey Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Abbey+Griffin)

At the end of pack two, Florent's deck was solid, but not exciting. This changed a little when he opened pack three, and a [Curse of Death's Hold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+Death%27s+Hold) was looking at him. This was not the time to be worrying about flip cards. Lucas looked at the heart shaped stamp on the card, kissed his fingers and touched them to the stamp mark. This was the gift his deck needed. He picked a couple of [Bonds of Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonds+of+Faith), along with more [Abbey Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abbey+Griffin) action, along with a [Bitterheart Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterheart+Witch) who would be able to find his powerful curse at a moment's notice. Potentially he could even use [Altar's Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Reap) for a powerful trick to pick up the curse.



![Bonds of Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bonds+of+Faith)
![Bitterheart Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bitterheart+Witch)

Black/white, splashing [Brimstone Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimstone+Volley), Lucas Florent ended the draft happy both with his deck, and that he had a fair idea of what was going on at the table. He was a little concerned that his deck wasn't super fast for the format (which can have some very quick starts), but overall, the Frenchman was happy with his chances.




Round 11: Feature Match - Christian Calcano vs. Philippe Venchiarutti
---------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby* 


![Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Burning+Vengeance)

When finding out about the format, one of the first decks I was hoping was a 'real deck' was the [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) deck. I've always been a huge fan of build around uncommons, and like [Furnace Celebration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Celebration) or [Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift), the [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) deck seemed like it could be a real deck.


I was pretty happy when I heard from Lucas Florent that he'd won two side drafts on Saturday with it, and had been spreading the word amongst a few of the other pros at the event. The trick is that right now, if you see one early, you can wait for it to lap the table, and just pick up the good flashback cards early. The flashback cards are good enough that if it doesn't pan out, then you are still in fine shape, and if it works, then you are golden. Golden is an appropriate description, as barring the necessary red, there are quite a few options for flashback, as it is in all colours. Blue is a great pairing, as it enables [Desperate Ravings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings), plus quality bounce spells, but there is also a version that is Naya colours, and has fun with [Travel Preparations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Travel+Preparations), and [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) support.


One player that took note was Christian Calcano. He managed to pick up a fairly spicy red/white/blue (team America) version of the deck, with a slew of flashback spells, and four(!) copies of the namesake enchantment. Now in round 11 we will see how it goes. His opponent, Philippe Venchiarutti could not know what was about to hit him.


### Game One


Calcano took early hits from an [Invisible Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invisible+Stalker), but when his [Desperate Ravings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings) randomly put a [Rolling Temblor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Temblor) into the grumper, it became clear that he'd have a way of dealing with the 1/1 at some point. He cast first a [Voiceless Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voiceless+Spirit), then a [Chapel Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chapel+Geist) with which to gum up the board until he had time to extract some vengeance.


A [Stitched Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake) (fuelled by an earlier [Forbidden Alchemy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy)) held off Calcano, but the New Yorker did have a [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) to play. Venchiarutti cast a [Curiosity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curiosity) on his [Invisible Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invisible+Stalker) to create a card drawing engine, and followed up with [Moan of the Unhallowed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moan+of+the+Unhallowed). Calcano seemed unconcerned, casting a [Rolling Temblor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Temblor) from his hand to leave his opponent with just a [Stitched Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake).



![Bloodgift Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bloodgift+Demon)

Venchiarutti was not out of gas. He had a [Bloodgift Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodgift+Demon), who could in theory turn the game around. I say in theory, because a [Geistflame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistflame) did one point when cast, then three when flashed back, thanks to [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance), to off the 5/4 in short order. Could Venchiarutti come back? He had a [Disciple of Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Griselbrand), but as Calcano built up on lands to be able to flash things back, it put Venchiarutti's options on a slimming plan almost as bad for him as Atkins. Calcano used [Silent Departure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure) on [Stitched Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake), forcing Venchiarutti to keep eating his graveyard to play creatures. After it came down again, Calcano used flashback to bounce the drake and off the disciple. The engine was well and truly rolling.


[Sensory Deprivation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensory+Deprivation) on Calcano's creatures was a non-issue. A second [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) meant that the remaining flashback spells in Calcano's graveyard would deal 4 damage (split two ways if needed). Given that those two flashback cards were both [Rolling Temblor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Temblor), it would be very tough for Venchiarutti to keep any creatures on the battlefield.


Venchiarutti was willing to give it a try, with an [Unburial Rites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) to get back his [Bloodgift Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodgift+Demon). This forced a flashback on one of the Temblors, to keep the path clear, and allow Calcano to plink in for 2 with a [Chapel Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chapel+Geist). The flashback from Venchiarutti was not nearly as exciting as Calcano's, getting back the Demon for only a very short time before a [Feeling of Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feeling+of+Dread) proved aptly named, setting up attacks, plus a huge amount of [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance).

*Christian Calcano*

### Game Two


Calcano shuffled fast, clearly itching to play another game with what seemed to be a very fun deck. On the draw, he saw a [Village Cannibals](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Village+Cannibals) as the first creature from his opponent, and didn't have a third land himself, leading him to discard a [Battleground Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battleground+Geist).


A [Night Terrors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Terrors) saw [Geistflame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistflame), [Feeling of Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feeling+of+Dread), [Rolling Temblor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Temblor), [Chapel Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chapel+Geist) and three copies of [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance). Venchiarutti took the creature, and hoped to be able to beat down hard enough that he'd not have to see vengeance happen.


With Calcano discarding a [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance), still short on land, Venchiarutti went for it with his [Bloodgift Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodgift+Demon), and then a [Stromkirk Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Patrol). Calcano looked to be in very rough shape. He used a [Feeling of Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feeling+of+Dread) to buy some time, and then finally found a third land to cast a [Fiend Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter) to deal with the Demon. When a [Moon Heron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moon+Heron) got all curious, and Calcano still didn't have a fourth land, he packed in his cards, he would have to get it on game three.


Christian Calcano 1 â€“ 1 Philippe Venchiarutti


### Game Three


For game three on the play, Calcano was quick to keep his hand. He had a [Chapel Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chapel+Geist) on turn three, which Venchiarutti answered (after a fashion) with [One-Eyed Scarecrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One-Eyed+Scarecrow). Calcano had a turn four [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance), and was building up mana nicely. He didn't have a spell on turn five, and passed, looking on as Venchiarutti cast an end step [Forbidden Alchemy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy), discarding a land, [Invisible Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invisible+Stalker) and [Moan of the Unhallowed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moan+of+the+Unhallowed).



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/fm11%20Phillipe%20Venchiarutti.jpg)
*Phillipe Venchiarutti*

On his own turn, Venchiarutti cast [Night Terrors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Terrors), to which Calcano responded with a [Geistflame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistflame), in order to get the instant into his graveyard. This left [Silent Departure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure), [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and [Feeling of Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feeling+of+Dread) in his hand. One way or another he would have some flashback fodder. Venchiarutti took the [Silent Departure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure), and when Calcano flashed back [Geistflame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistflame) to kill [One-Eyed Scarecrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One-Eyed+Scarecrow), he had [Altar's Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Reap) ready to draw some cards with.


Venchiarutti rebuilt his board with a [Stromkirk Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Patrol), which got stuck in unimpeded before [Stitched Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake) came down, and [Sensory Deprivation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensory+Deprivation) got put on [Chapel Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chapel+Geist). Calcano no longer had attacking options, and passed his turn without a play, holding four cards in hand. He used [Feeling of Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feeling+of+Dread) to hold off attacks for a turn, but didn't have an answer to [Bloodgift Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodgift+Demon). He cast a [Rolling Temblor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Temblor) simply to get it into his graveyard for later back-flashing.


When Venchiarutti went for attacks, Calcano flashed back [Feeling of Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feeling+of+Dread) to tap everything but Venchiarutti's demon, and did 2 damage to the 5/4. He tried to cast [Purify the Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purify+the+Grave) (with enough mana to flash it back) but was thwarted by a [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) from Venchiarutti. Calcano was now in very rough shape, as his opponent had a sizeable air force in the demon and [Stitched Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake), along with the continued ability to draw two cards a turn.


Calcano, visibly rattled by the [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate), had to flash back his [Rolling Temblor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Temblor) to deal with [Stromkirk Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Patrol) while it could, but was then left cold to attacks from Venchiarutti's demon. After a powerful first game, it was Venchiarutti who got the final vengeance.


**Phillipe Philippe Venchiarutt wins 2-1!**

...there are great matches. At 8-3, even five straight wins may not be enough. Nonetheless, that path begins for Marijn Lybaert and Christophe Gregoir with an all-Belgia elimination battle. Fighting to lead the Italian charge are Marcello Calvetto and Matteo Versari. One will move to 11-1, the other slipping back into the chasing pack. Also at 10-1 is Matteo Rusconi, the Swiss player who now needs to defeat Raphael Levy, the storied Hall of Famer. Finally, sitting above them all, two players compete at 11-0 to deny their opponent a continued perfect record, as Michael Milis of Belgium faces the Swiss former Team World Champion Nico Bohny. Stand by for some great Magic, as it happened.

Sunday, 11:28 a.m.: Travel Preparations â€“ The World Tour
--------------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby* 

Here at Grand Prix Milan, we have more players than have ever before descended upon an Italian **Magic** event. While the greatest number of them are themselves Italian, there are a fabled few who have come from rather further away, and there seems to be a growing trend of making these long distance **Magic** trips into more extended periods of travel, or even part of the regular routine.


The poster child for the travelling **Magic** player is Shuhei Nakamura. The Japanese pro only misses Grand Prix because there are other Grand Prix going on at the same time somewhere else in the world. He's got the bag to show for it, along with a truly epic number of lifetime Planeswalker points, that places him securely at level 50, and realistically probably some fabled level 51 or 52.


One novelty for Shuhei in terms of travel that still remains to happen is bringing his family to a big event. This will be rectified this year when both his father and sister make the trip out to San Francisco, where he will be inducted into the Hall of Fame. While there are few people who travel quite as much as Shuhei, it seems that the entire Nakamura clan has a certain wanderlust â€“ his sister is also well travelled, and is apparently looking forward to California in November courtesy of Wizards of the Coast. Who wouldn't?


Martin Juza is the other player who is a reliable fixture on the Grand Prix world tour, and between him and Shuhei the number of air miles racked up per year is frankly terrifying. It is the combination of Juza and Nakamura that has lead to an epic trip for later this month.


When I asked Martin what his current travel schedule was, he laid it out for me in some detail.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/Shuhei%27s%20travel%20bag%20is%20always%20packed.jpg)
*Shuhei's travel bag is always packed*

'From Prague, I came here to Milan. Then Shuhei and I are going to Brisbane, then on to Lima, where some of the guys from the USA will meet us. Then we're going on to Cusco, Macchu Pichu and GP Santiago. After that I'm heading over to Tokyo to test with Shuhei, then on to Hiroshima.


After that I'll be at home (Prague) for a week, before going to San Francisco for Worlds, then home for Christmas.'


It is a wonder that Juza and Nakamura ever have any idea what time it is, they are changing time zones so often. The secret, as far as I can tell, is that Nakamura at least seems to grab sleep whenever he can, saving up energy for the tournaments that for him are a reality just about every single weekend.


Once we get past 'the regulars' we have the New York crew. For this event, that means Christian Calcano and Gaudenis Vidugiris, each of whom find travel to Europe from the big apple easy enough to warrant a trip. Calcano, a particular fan of limited, was keen to get to as many Grand Prix as possible to give him the best shot at hitting level 6 by the end of the season, and saw Milan as a great opportunity to leverage his skill at limited and turn it into more Pro Points.


We've already heard yesterday about Melissa Detora's travels, but it would certainly be remiss of me not to mention her within the posse of players making their way across the globe, hunting down points, prizes, and places on the Pro Tour. Having spoken to Carrie Oliver from England, who is still doing well on draft day, she has said that depending on her qualification status for Honolulu, she too might find herself travelling more for Grand Prix.


Finally, from China, Wu Tong of the Chinese National squad made the trip to Milan. For him, part of the appeal was the opportunity to do some trading â€“ a lot of players really like cards with Chinese writing on, and that's something that he has plenty of access to, while some of the legacy staples are much harder to find back home. He squeaked into day 2, but has an uphill struggle today if he is to get to the very top, having gone to bed last night on a 7-3 record.


Us coverage guys are relative amateurs when it comes to travel. I only have GP Milan, GP Amsterdam, Worlds in San Francisco and maybe a cheeky trip to New York for New Years left in my travel calendar this year. I know you don't need to be Shuhei Nakamura levels of good to travel as much as he does, but I can't help but think it helps.




Sunday, 12:34 p.m. â€“ Drafting
-----------------------------


*by Tobi Henke* 

So, is *Innistrad* Draft a fast format? What are the best colors and color archetypes? How important is tempo in relation to card advantage? Are there maybe even match-ups you better want to avoid?


Nico Bohny just finished playing in the feature match area for the fourth time in a row. He won all of those matches and was now sitting comfortably atop the standings at 12-0. This guy clearly knows something about *Innistrad* limited. "My favorite color combinations are blue-white and blue-red. Blue's just so good," he said. Many players argue for blue-black, but he disagrees. "I don't like black. Although it does have quite a lot of bombs, on average I found black rather disappointing. Green-white *can* be good, when you're really aggressive, but mainly I just like blue."



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/blog_draft_bohny.jpg)
*Nico Bohny*

Regarding the speed of the format he opined, "It's not very fast. Sometimes green-white or blue-white come up with superfast aggrodecks. Most other combinations, though, are rather defensive. Which isn't to say, that tempo is not a big issue. It is. You definitely want to play first in Booster Draft. Not necessarily in Sealed Deck, but even there, playing first can be a big advantage."


"I don't really know about match-ups, it seems any color combination can beat every other," Bohny said. "But with the typical Human deck you basically never want to play against another Human deck. [Bonds of Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonds+of+Faith) and [Avacynian Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacynian+Priest) lose a lot of value in this pairing."



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/blog_draft_levy.jpg)
*Raphael Levy*

Hall of Famer Raphael Levy said about the format's speed, "It's not really fast. I mean, tempo is important but that doesn't mean it's fast."


He added, "Synergy plays a big role in *Innistrad* limited. In that regard, it's very different from *Scars of Mirrodin* or *M12*. You either were drafting infect or you weren't, and in *M12* you mainly had to figure out your colors. It's a nice change and a great format. I like it a lot."


"I'm not sure yet about archetypes," Levy said. "Blue-red flashback can be a real monster."




Round 13: Gruesome Transformations â€“ Federico Del Basso vs. Raphael Levy
------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby* 

It has been a while since Raphael Levy hit top 8 of a Grand Prix. The last time was in 2008 at Grand Prix Birmingham. The Hall of Fame member has won three of them over the years, with the first in 1998, playing a green land destruction deck. Following that his next wins were in Dallas and Singapore on successive weekends with the same five colour zoo deck. These days, Raph's **Magic** practice schedule is broken up by training in the formidable martial art of jiu-jitsu, for which he trains at least as much as **Magic**. That doesn't mean to say that the Hall of Fame ring doesn't count these days though. Raph is still a regular of the **Magic** circuit.


Extended is the format that Raph has won with the most, but with 8 top eights at Grand Prix level at limited events, he is certainly no slouch with 40 card decks. Would Milan provide another trophy for his cabinet?


Federico Del Basso certainly hoped not. He had been sat opposite Raph in the draft, and could see clearly the blue flip cards Levy had taken just as easily as Levy had spotted his red werewolves. Each knew the matchup, it was just a question of who would prevail in it.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/fm13%20Federico%20Del%20Basso.jpg)
*Federico Del Basso*

### Game One


Levy led with a [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), but his blue/black/red deck did not give him the tools he needed to turn it into a 3/2 flyer in the opening turns. Meanwhile, the aggressive red/white build of Del Basso had a turn two [Unruly Mob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unruly+Mob). On turn four, a [Forbidden Alchemy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) ensured that an [Insectile Aberration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) would be going all Brundlefly on Del Basso, for 3 damage in the air.


A [Tormented Pariah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Pariah) from Del Basso was stopped by [Frightful Delusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightful+Delusion), and Raph had a 1/6 [Fortress Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortress+Crab) to block the [Pitchburn Devils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pitchburn+Devils) that came after it. Raph seemed well in control of the game when he dropped a Sellhof Occultist and Skirsday High Priest all in one turn. A [Reckless Waif](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Waif) from Del Basso didn't seem a worry for Levy, who drew some cards with [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice), and looked on as a second [Pitchburn Devils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pitchburn+Devils) entered the battlefield. The reason was simple. He had just enough removal to clear a path and attack for the final points. When all the attacking was done, it was on to game two.

*Ralph Levy*

Raphael Levy 1 â€“ 0 Federico Del Basso


### Game Two


For the second game, Levy again had a turn one [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), but this time his [Skirsdag High Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirsdag+High+Priest) came on turn two and was followed by a curve of Sellhof Occultist and [Moon Heron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moon+Heron), while Del Basso was stuck on just two copies of [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). Del Basso had been forced to mulligan, and within a small number of turns he was forced to concede to a very aggressive start from the Frenchman.


Raphael Levy 2 â€“ 0 Federico Del Basso




Sunday, 2:14 p.m. - Drafting with Marcello Calvetto
---------------------------------------------------


*by Tobi Henke* 

The reigning Italian national champion Marcello Calvetto sat down at his rightful spot, here at the Italian Grand Prix of the season. A 12-1 record had brought him to draft table number one, now he was looking to turn that into what would be the third GP Top 8 of his career.


### Pack One


He opened a solid but unspectacular pack with [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice), [Armored Skaab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab), [Blazing Torch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Torch), [Midnight Haunting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Haunting), and [Tribute to Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribute+to+Hunger). He considered all the options and went with [Midnight Haunting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Haunting).


For his second pick he was given the choice to either turn to blue for [Invisible Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invisible+Stalker), [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice), or [Silent Departure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure), or to stay in white and take [Elder Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Cathar). He chose white. The third pack was completely devoid of any white cards, though it did have [Battleground Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battleground+Geist) for some sweet synergy with [Midnight Haunting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Haunting), as well as [Stitched Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake) (not much of a combo with [Midnight Haunting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Haunting)) and [Essence of the Wild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+of+the+Wild). [Battleground Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battleground+Geist) it was.


The next pack had even more green in [Villagers of Estwald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villagers+of+Estwald) and [Woodland Sleuth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Sleuth), along with [Mask of Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mask+of+Avacyn), [Spectral Flight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Flight), and [Feeling of Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feeling+of+Dread). He flicked back and forth between the nongreen cards for a while. In the end, he picked [Feeling of Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feeling+of+Dread). Pick five was an easy choice in comparison: Calvetto took note of the [Kessig Wolf Run](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Wolf+Run) still in the pack but clearly, at this point in the draft, he took [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice).


No white and blue cards again, so he had to make do with [Demonmail Hauberk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonmail+Hauberk) as his sixth pick. Next, he was passed a booster with [Makeshift Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mauler), [Selhoff Occultist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selhoff+Occultist), and [Moment of Heroism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment+of+Heroism), all at once. He opted for [Makeshift Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mauler).


Packs like these were beginning to turn into a problem. If a booster had blue or white cards at all, most often it had a lot of them. Sitting left from Calvetto, Nico Bohny picked up the leftovers and was drafting white-blue himself. This would undoubtedly hurt Calvetto in pack two.


**The rest of pack one:**  
[Corpse Lunge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Lunge)  
[Fortress Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortress+Crab)  
[Stromkirk Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Patrol)  
[Frightful Delusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightful+Delusion)  
[Nightbird's Clutches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightbird%27s+Clutches)  
[Intangible Virtue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intangible+Virtue)  
[Curse of the Bloody Tome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+the+Bloody+Tome)


### Pack Two


First pick from the second pack came down to a choice between [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) and two off-color options: Calvetto had gotten a couple of minorly useful black cards at the tail end of pack one, so [Abattoir Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abattoir+Ghoul) received special consideration. Even more so, Calvetto pondered whether to splash for [Heretic's Punishment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heretic%27s+Punishment). He thought twice about it, and went with [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice).


Next up, was a second [Midnight Haunting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Haunting) over [Armored Skaab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab), then [Stitched Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake) over [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice).


Pick four offered [Spectral Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Rider), [Chapel Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chapel+Geist), or [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) â€“ quite the selection, considering Nico Bohny had already taken a card out of this booster for his own white-blue deck! Which one? [Geist-Honored Monk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist-Honored+Monk). Calvetto didn't know this of course, and was fine with [Spectral Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Rider).


[Silverchase Fox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverchase+Fox) was the only white or blue card in the next booster, whereas the one after that once again had three: [Thraben Sentry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Sentry), [Unruly Mob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unruly+Mob), and [Feeling of Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feeling+of+Dread). Calvetto chose [Unruly Mob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unruly+Mob), possibly in consideration of all the [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice)s he had seen going around the table, one of which he had already drafted.


**The rest of pack two:**  
[Rally the Peasants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Peasants)  
[Sensory Deprivation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensory+Deprivation)  
[Moment of Heroism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment+of+Heroism)  
[Inquisitor's Flail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisitor%27s+Flail)  
[Traitorous Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traitorous+Blood)  
[Hysterical Blindness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hysterical+Blindness)  
[Night Revelers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Revelers)  
[Maw of the Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maw+of+the+Mire)


### Pack Three


Calvetto opened a number of great cards, [Bloodline Keeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper), [Falkenrath Marauders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Marauders), [Moan of the Unhallowed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moan+of+the+Unhallowed), none of which he could take. All he got for himself was [Rebuke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rebuke). Then he drafted [Deranged Assistant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Assistant) over [Divine Reckoning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Reckoning) and [Blazing Torch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Torch) and followed it up with [Spectral Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Rider) over [Elder Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Cathar).


Pick four was [Spectral Flight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Flight) out of a weak booster, while afterwards he picked [Chapel Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chapel+Geist) and had to pass [Silent Departure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure). Considering the development of the draft, [Thraben Sentry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Sentry) seemed a fine sixth pick, and [Claustrophobia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Claustrophobia) seventh was an interesting surprise.


**The rest of pack three:**  
[Sharpened Pitchfork](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sharpened+Pitchfork)  
[Spare from Evil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spare+from+Evil)  
[Rally the Peasants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Peasants)  
[Thraben Purebloods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Purebloods)  
[Nightbird's Clutches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightbird%27s+Clutches)  
[Night Terrors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Terrors)  
[Graveyard Shovel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graveyard+Shovel)




Round 14: Feature Match â€“ Peter Vieren vs. Lucas Florent
--------------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby* 

Lucas Florent is still riding high on the standings, having come out of the first draft with a 2-1 record that could have been 3-0 had he not made a slight mistake in one of his game 3's. That puts him on 33 points, and has found him matched up against top Belgian player Peter Vieren. With just two losses thus far, Florent had just a small amount further to go to secure a spot in the top eight.


### Game One


On the draw, Vieren had a mulligan, and his red/green decks started out with a pair of [Cobbled Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobbled+Wings), followed by a [Villagers of Estwald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villagers+of+Estwald) to give them to. Florent didn't need to give his [Moon Heron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moon+Heron) wings, it could quite happily do the job with its own. The wings in fact went to a [Gatstaf Shepherd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatstaf+Shepherd), who fell to a Flaming Torch, while Florent also had a [Vampire Interloper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Interloper) for his side of the board.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/fm14%20Peter%20Vieren.jpg)
*Peter Vieren*

Vieren, short on lands, simply equipped his Villagers and let them transform on his opponent's turn. He had a [Ranger's Guile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger%27s+Guile) to protect them from a [Silent Departure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure), and soon followed up with a [Kruin Outlaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kruin+Outlaw). While the [Howlpack of Estwald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howlpack+of+Estwald) was bounced by the flashback on [Silent Departure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure), they were soon back on the battlefield (albeit in human form).



![Kruin Outlaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kruin+Outlaw)
![Terror of Kruin Pass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Terror+of+Kruin+Pass)

Florent was trying to race the werewolves, knowing that while Vieren was stuck on lands, he would have a shot at getting enough flying damage in. That two of his flyers were [Vampire Interloper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Interloper) rather forced the issue. Vieren again had no play for the turn beyond equipping his Villagers, meaning that on Florent's turn he ended up with a [Howlpack of Estwald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howlpack+of+Estwald) and a [Terror of Kruin Pass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror+of+Kruin+Pass). Florent could not afford to take hits from them, but had to pass with both players on 10 life.


Vieren swung in, and somewhat surprisingly Florent had to scoop up his cards. He flashed two copies of [Victim of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Victim+of+Night) in his hand with a smile. Those were not the answers he needed when there were werewolves on the hunt.


Peter Vieren 1 â€“ 0 Lucas Florent


### Game Two


Florent led with [Typhoid Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Typhoid+Rats), who died to Vieren's first play; a [Geistflame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistflame). Those [Cobbled Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobbled+Wings) came back for Vieren, and then the game hit turn three â€“ werewolf turn. Equipment was proving a good combination with werewolves, as it provides some activity for the turn, but not enough to stop the wolves from flipping out and getting big.


After a little thought, Vieren attacked with his 2/3, and cast a [Village Ironsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Village+Ironsmith), before equipping his villagers. [Moon Heron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moon+Heron) cracked back, before [Walking Corpse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Corpse) joined Florent's team.


Vieren ran in with his team, and when Florent blocked, he had the [Moonmist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonmist) ready for a swift transformation. The life totals went to 14 each, and Vieren's board suddenly looked a little scary. Florent had a [Silent Departure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure) for the [Howlpack of Estwald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howlpack+of+Estwald), and then when Vieren tried for a [One-Eyed Scarecrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One-Eyed+Scarecrow), he had [Lost in the Mist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lost+in+the+Mist) to both counter the spell, and clear Vieren's side of the board.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/fm14%20Lucas%20Florent.jpg)
*Lucas Florent*

Vieren was having trouble sticking creatures for any length of time. He landed [Villagers of Estwald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villagers+of+Estwald), but lost [Village Ironsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Village+Ironsmith) to [Frightful Delusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightful+Delusion), which took another werewolf with it. Vieren's Howlpack flipped again, and [Prey Upon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon) allowed it to fight [Moon Heron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moon+Heron), making it the only creature left on the board. The life totals were 8 to 7 in Florent's favour, but without any creatures, and facing a 4/6 with some [Cobbled Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobbled+Wings), that was little comfort. Lucas Tried a flashback [Silent Departure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure), but was met with [Ranger's Guile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger%27s+Guile). He had to make do with casting [Vampire Interloper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Interloper) to force the flip.


Come on topdeck! Florent needed something and got it in [Tribute to Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribute+to+Hunger). He lost his 2/1 vampire to the flashed back [Geistflame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistflame), but had at least got rid of the big threat. He cast a [Fortress Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortress+Crab) with a chuckle, hoping the 1/6 would be a big enough blocker.


Vieren still had threats. He cast first [Reckless Waif](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Waif), then [Village Ironsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Village+Ironsmith), and finally [Kruin Outlaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kruin+Outlaw). That crab didn't look quite good enough. Just a few short attack steps later it was all over.


**Peter Vieren wins 2-0!**

Sunday, 3:30 p.m.: Tribal Spotlight â€“ Humans
--------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby* 

Oh humans. Every morning I wake up, and there's one staring at me in the mirror. Well, most of the time. Some of the time it's a zombie, but on those occasions I sometimes just forgo the mirror entirely.


There are a lot of good things to say about humans in *Innistrad* draft, and I specially chose to hold them back until draft day to talk about, because many of the human cards fit together rather nicely as a draft archetype. When I asked Shuhei Nakamura about how he likes to draft *Innistrad*, he confessed that he is happiest when being aggressive, and unlike many other formats, that doesn't tend to mean being black or red. In this format, Nakaura favours white as the best colour, followed by green or blue to apply a tempo-oriented beatdown plan.



![Fiend Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fiend+Hunter)
![Slayer of the Wicked](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Slayer+of+the+Wicked)

[Avacynian Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacynian+Priest) is a great place to start this conversation. He's unashamedly pro human, and anti anything else. Species-ist he may be, but he is among the very top commons in *Innistrad*, where there are plenty of other kinds of monsters than homo sapiens. [Bonds of Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonds+of+Faith) is another card that does double duty between pumping up the good guys, and bringing down the bad. With quality removal in [Fiend Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter) and [Slayer of the Wicked](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slayer+of+the+Wicked), the white humans can handily beat down while dealing with opposing threats.



![Travel Preparations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Travel+Preparations)
![Spidery Grasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spidery+Grasp)

Where things get interesting is with one of Nakamura's picks for another top common in the set. [Travel Preparations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Travel+Preparations) really does it all, and is one of the big cards in the green white strategy. Green/White is traditionally a fairly horrible draft archetype, but it is seeing something of a renaissance in *Innistrad*, where [Prey Upon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon) and [Spidery Grasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spidery+Grasp) join forces with various quality sources of removal in white to back up what is already an excellent array of creatures with evasion, and in many cases the power to beat down.


With quality creatures starting at the 1 drop, green/white can certainly present a fast clock, and that clock only accelerates thanks to [Timely Reinforcements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Reinforcements). Making two creatures bigger once is fine, but doing so a second time often makes them board-dominating, and in a world full of werewolves, it is exactly the kind of one-two punch that can ensure that the dogs are well trained and learn to obey their masters.



![Geist-Honored Monk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Geist-Honored+Monk)
![Mayor of Avabruck](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mayor+of+Avabruck)


![Elder Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Elder+Cathar)
![Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gavony+Township)

If some of the other tribes are all about their splashy rares, humans is more about the commons, and this is what tends to make them strong in draft. They have good rares, no doubt (my personal favourite being human/spirit crossover [Geist-Honored Monk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist-Honored+Monk), with honourable mentions to [Mayor of Avabruck](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mayor+of+Avabruck) and [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township)), but can quite happily beat with [Elder Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Cathar)s who, upon death, simply make other humans into a special kind of monster.



![Avacyn's Pilgrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Avacyn%27s+Pilgrim)


![Sharpened Pitchfork](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sharpened+Pitchfork)
![Butcher's Cleaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Butcher%27s+Cleaver)

Many of the human creatures that are best are role-players. [Avacyn's Pilgrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Pilgrim) is a solid addition to a deck rather than its focus, but with enough cogs together, humans make quite the machine. They are also often best placed to use equipment well, with [Butcher's Cleaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher%27s+Cleaver) or [Sharpened Pitchfork](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sharpened+Pitchfork) proving far more effective in the right hands.


While *Innistrad* is full of monsters, watch out for the people too. Push them around and they just might fight back. With appropriate [Travel Preparations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Travel+Preparations) they can deploy quite the force.

39 points. It's a lot. It's an awful lot, equivalent to 13 wins. It might not be enough. With two rounds to go, all the eight players in the feature match area know that a win will take them to 39. From there, an Intentional Draw might see them home. While the permutations are many, one thing is clear - losing is not a good idea. Hear Samuele Estratti battle Lucas Blohon. Can Raphael Levy get the point he needs against Finland's Sami Tuomi? Klaus Jons of Germany has an Italian to face in Davide Vergoni, while Denmark's Allen Christensen is in the same position, looking to knock out a home hope in the form of Federico del Basso. There's some terrific stuff in this one, and a nailbiter that goes right to the wire.

Round 15: Feature Match - Samuele Estratti vs. Lukas Blohon
-----------------------------------------------------------


*by Tobi Henke* 

The match started off with Lukas Blohon taking a mulligan. And another. And another. Usually, this would almost be the end of game one, but this time it really was just the beginning ...


### Game One


Because, as it turned out, Samuele Estratti had his own share of bad luck. On his turn five, he still had just two [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and an [Inquisitor's Flail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisitor%27s+Flail) on the battlefield. Meanwhile, Bohon had played [Moan of the Unhallowed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moan+of+the+Unhallowed) on turn four, followed by [Undead Alchemist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Alchemist) on turn five. The Zombie tokens went unimpeded and put the top four cards of Estratti's library into his graveyard. Three creature cards among them meant Blohon received another three 2/2 Zombie tokens. The army of undead continued to grow, and it was over as soon as one would have expected from a game including a mulligan to four. Only with an entirely unexpected result.

*Lukas Blohon*

### Game Two


This time Estratti's deck was much more cooperative and gave him [Spectral Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Rider) on turn two, [Avacynian Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacynian+Priest) on turn three. Blohon had [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice), then decided to take a look at Estratti's hand via [Night Terrors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Terrors). He saw [Angel of Flight Alabaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Flight+Alabaster), [Dead Weight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+Weight), [Abbey Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abbey+Griffin), and [Galvanic Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Juggernaut), but no land that would allow Estratti to cast either of the four-drops or the Angel. Blohon made Estratti discard [Galvanic Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Juggernaut).


Estratti topdecked [Vampire Interloper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Interloper) adding to the evasion theme started with [Spectral Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Rider). Blohon summoned [Armored Skaab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab). The four cards he put into his graveyard? A [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap)er of the Abyss, [Undead Alchemist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Alchemist), and [Undead Alchemist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Alchemist)!


Estratti's evasive creatures continued to beat down. Blohon cast [Stitched Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake) to at least stop [Vampire Interloper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Interloper), but of course Estratti still had [Avacynian Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacynian+Priest) to keep the sky clear. He also found a fourth land to cast [Abbey Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abbey+Griffin). Blohon summoned a second flier, [Battleground Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battleground+Geist), but that fell victim to [Urgent Exorcism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urgent+Exorcism), while [Avacynian Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacynian+Priest) once again tapped down [Stitched Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake). Blohon went from 10 to 4, looked at his next card, and conceded.


Samuele Estratti 1 â€“ 1 Lukas Blohon

*Samuele Estratti*

### Game Three


Both players kept their opening seven and didn't miss a beat for the first couple of turns. Blohon had [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice), then traded away his [Lantern Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+Spirit) for Estratti's [Vampire Interloper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Interloper), who immediately replaced it with [Spectral Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Rider). This exchange allowed Blohon to cast [Makeshift Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mauler) on turn four, whereas Estratti made [Mausoleum Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Guard) and got in for 2 damage with his [Spectral Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Rider).


Blohon made [Armored Skaab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab), cast [Silent Departure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure) on [Mausoleum Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Guard), and attacked for 5 with [Makeshift Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mauler) and [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice). Esttratti got rid of the 4/5 via [Smite the Monstrous](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smite+the+Monstrous), then decided to stay back with his [Spectral Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Rider).


His aggressive start and an apparently never-ending stream of lands had left Blohon with just one card in hand by now. He passed the turn without play and simply used [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice) to turn his [Armored Skaab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab) into a 2/2 Homunculus. Estratti replayed his [Mausoleum Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Guard) and attacked with [Spectral Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Rider).


Blohon cast [Grasp of Phantoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Phantoms), Estratti replayed [Mausoleum Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Guard), Blohon replayed [Grasp of Phantoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Phantoms). Estratti replayed [Mausoleum Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Guard), Blohon replayed [Silent Departure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure). But when all was said and done Estratti still had his [Mausoleum Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Guard) as well as his [Spectral Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Rider), whereas Blohon still only had a 2/2 token and [Stitcher's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice). Another [Spectral Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Rider) showed up on Estratti's side, then [Chapel Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chapel+Geist), and at this point, [Angel of Flight Alabaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Flight+Alabaster) wasn't even necessary anymore but was thrown in for good measure anyway.


Samuele Estratti 2 â€“ 1 Lukas Blohon




Sunday, 5:53 p.m. - Countdown to Top 8
--------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby* 

In the final round of Grand Prix Milan prior to the top 8 being announced, there were a number of pivotal games on which the final top 8 composition would hang.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/Lukas%20Jaklovsky.jpg)
*Lukas Jaklovsky*

Sami Tuomi of Sweden was against Jorg Unfried from Germany, Lukas Jaklovsky of the Czech Republic played Marco Picci from Italy, and Marcello Calvetto of Italy squared off against Guillaume Peret from France. From this collection of players, the one closest to being locked in was Calvetto, though even he had to be a little careful, as last round calculations could leave him just missing depending on how some results would go.


When the clock started at 50 minutes, everyone was in contention. As time ticked away though, so did some players' tournament life.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/Jorg%20Unfried.jpg)
*Jorg Unfried*

Marcello Calvetto was the first to draw blood in the feature match area. His aggressive red/white/blue deck focused on spirits had the 'flyer' draw, while the more werewolf themed version of the deck across the table wasn't able to race on the ground. With 42 minutes left to go, Peret was already a game down.


With 39 minutes left Jorg Unfried also went a game up. He'd been attacked down pretty hard by a succession of copies of [Orchard Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orchard+Spirit), pumped by [Travel Preparations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Travel+Preparations). The green/white deck from Tuomi was able to swing in for lots of unblockable damage, but as Tuomi fell behind on lands, Unfried was able to simply play bigger creatures and race. While [Essence of the Wild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+of+the+Wild) didn't dominate the game from Unfried, the last fattie did manage to kill Tuomi.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/Marco%20Picci.jpg)
*Marco Picci*

At 36 minutes, Marco Picci got his first game win, though to be honest, the game had been locked up for a while. Picci had drafted a red/blue [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) deck, and with three copies of the enchantment in play, it seemed only a matter of time before he'd burn his opponent out. It took a few copies of [Dream Twist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Twist) to fill Picci's graveyard, but when he did, it scored him a win in decisive fashion.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/Sami%20Tuomi.jpg)
*Sami Tuomi*

At 31 minutes we saw some vengeance from Tuomi against Jorg Unfried. His [Orchard Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orchard+Spirit) plan worked better with more lands, and the [Travel Preparations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Travel+Preparations) this time proved ample support. It was 1-1 there, and on to a decider.


At 28 minutes Guillaume Peret managed to tie up his game too. His deck, sporting two copies of [Kruin Outlaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kruin+Outlaw), managed to stick one, along with [Rakish Heir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakish+Heir) and some vampire friends for the ground and pound.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/Guillaume%20Peret.jpg)
*Guillaume Peret*

Picci didn't like the sound of this game three nonsense. He took down his game two with 26 minutes left on the clock, again with multiple copies of [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance), again with plenty of back flashery. Winner.


The decider between Sami Tuomi and Jorg Unfried took a little time, ending with 18 minutes left on the clock, but in many regards was dominated by Jorg's turn two play. [Mayor of Avabruck](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mayor+of+Avabruck) stayed in play until the game ended, and spent much of that time as a werewolf beckoning more wolves to join him. While there was a supporting cast of [Ambush Viper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambush+Viper)s, it was the wolves that stole the show.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmil11/Marcello%20Calvetto.jpg)
*Marcello Calvetto*

The final deciding game was looking tight for a while, as both Calvetto and Peret had solid draws. It looked like there would be something of a race, and [Battleground Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battleground+Geist) plus a host of spirits was just ahead. As Calvetto went in for what would be a lethal attack, Peret asked if Calvetto would consider an intentional draw. The one point should be sufficient for Calvetto to be in top eight, and the extra point for Peret would give him a chance at top 16 and all that comes with it. After a little thought, Calvetto extended his hand. Now there were just 12 minutes to wait until the end of the round, and announcement of the top 8.

Rounding out our series on some of the most interesting cards in Innistrad, Marijn Lybaert casts his eye over the Green spells, including the mighty Garruk Relentless, while 2010 Grand Prix Lyon champion Florian Koch takes us through the artifacts and lands. As always, there's plenty more to think about and discover in the game that keeps on re-inventing itself.
