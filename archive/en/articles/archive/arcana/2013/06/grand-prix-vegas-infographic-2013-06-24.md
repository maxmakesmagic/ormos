This weekend more than 4,500 players battled on Saturday in the largest **Magic** tournament ever and what may be confirmed as the largest TCG tournament ever. You can read the full coverage from this weekend on [the coverage archives](/en/events/coverage/oliver-modern-master-las-vegas), or head over to the [Twitch.tv archives](http://www.twitch.tv/magic/videos) to watch the video coverage from this weekend.


As of this writing, no winner has been crowned yet. So, to whoever does win... well done!


One of the awesome pieces that came out of coverage this weekend is this amazing infographic written by coverage reporter [Nate Price](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=nate%20price), and designed by [GatheringMagic.com](http://www.gatheringmagic.com)'s James Arnold.
