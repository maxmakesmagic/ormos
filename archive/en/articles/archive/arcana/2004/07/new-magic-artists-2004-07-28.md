| *[Spinal Parasite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spinal+Parasite) by Cyril Van Der Haegen, [Bringer of the Green Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bringer+of+the+Green+Dawn) by Jim Murray, and [Neurok Stealthsuit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Stealthsuit) by Francis Tsai*  |

Every time a new set releases, another **Magic** artist gets his or her first artist credit. Today on Magic Arcana we take a moment to salute these arists that have begun their **Magic** art careers during the *Mirrodin* block. 


Got any favorites among the new recruits? [Go post](http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=268155)! Think you have what it takes to be a **Magic** artist? Check out our [art submission guidelines](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=contactinfo/artsubmission). 


Stay tuned for this fall: there are even more artists getting their first break into **Magic** illustration in the Kamigawa block beginning with *[Champions of Kamigawa](/en/node/606676)*.


Welcome, new **Magic** artists!
