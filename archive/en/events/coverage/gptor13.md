GRAND PRIX TORONTO 2013
-----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gptor13/winner.jpg)It's been a long time coming for Bostonian Ari Lax. The Gold-level pro has been seeking his first Grand Prix title for years, coming close in both Nashville back in 2010, and again in Providence earlier this year. Grand Prix Toronto marks his seventh Grand Prix Top 8, but more importantly, it also marks his first win.


Ari Lax navigated a field of 1603 players this weekend, in what became Canada's largest Grand Prix ever held. The field of over 1600 players cut down drastically going into Day Two, until only eight players remained. The Top 8 featured five players who have had multiple Grand Prix Top 8 finishes in 2013, including Hall of Fame member William "Huey" Jensen. However, it was Ari Lax who inevitably took down the whole tournament with an unconventional green-black deck that sported oddball stars such as [Bronze Sable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Sable) and the [Loathsome Catoblepas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loathsome+Catoblepas).


Grand Prix Toronto also marks the end of the qualification season for Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*. Robert Smith, Rich Kraupa, Edgar Magalhaes, and Seth Manfield earned themselves airfare and an invitation to the big event in Valencia next year.


But for now, the weekend is about Ari Lax and his big victory. After years of close calls, it has been a long time coming.
