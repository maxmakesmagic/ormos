The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 7, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by cycling, which makes everything better.


Today's Previews
================


Every day until the full set is revealed on April 14, I'll be sharing all the non-DailyMTG previews you can find around the web in this space. Here are today's:


1. [Exclusive *Amonkhet* Preview: Angel of Sanctions](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13888&writer=Craig+Wescoe&articledate=4-7-2017&utm_source=tcg-social&utm_medium=tcg-social&utm_term=&utm_content=magic&utm_campaign=tcg-social-mtg-ahk) | TCGPlayer | Craig Wescoe

Well this seems powerful. Twice. It was always a minor tragedy when your [Fiend Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter) died—with this Angel, you just get to bring him back for more.


1. [*Amonkhet* Previews](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/snack-time-51-amonkhet-previews/) | Snack Time | Ant Tessitore and Mike Linnemann

As is often the case, Snack Time gets a sneak peek at some lovely art and flavor that comes through on a trio of commons. As is always the case, they do a marvelous job digging into that art and flavor here.


1. [*Magic: The Gathering*: Las Nuevas Mecánicas De *Amonkhet* Y Carta Exclusiva](http://es.ign.com/magic-the-gathering/117027/feature/magic-the-gathering-las-nuevas-mecanicas-de-amonkhet-y-carta) | IGN Spain

The name of the card is Approach of the Second Sun and the text is essentially what you can [find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/63zzbl/akhneed_translation/dfy9mfb/), just templated more formally (though not by much).


Now get out there and start brewing with your new alternate win condition.


1. [*Amonkhet* Brings New Perspectives](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/new-perspectives/) | Top Level Podcast | Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores

My new perspective is that I will probably try to build around this far more than I should.


1. [*Amonkhet* spoiler: Poor Gideon . . .](https://arstechnica.co.uk/gaming/2017/04/amonkhet-cruel-reality/) | Ars Technica UK | Kyle Chapman

Man, who would have guessed that there's be a dark underbelly to Nicol Bolas world?


Clearly not Gideon.


1. [@mtgaaron](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron) | Coming Soon

I rarely see R&D members enjoy themselves more than when they pick out a card for Aaron Forsythe to preview. Stay tuned to see what they gave him this time.


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [StarCityGames.com Worcester Open](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/080417_worcester_fact_sheet.html) | [twitch.tv/scgtour](https://www.twitch.tv/scgtour) | Saturday and Sunday starting at 10:30 a.m. ET

It still blows my mind that Worcester is pronounced as "Wooster." I may never get over it.


Oh, yeah, also, they're streaming Legacy. So that's happening. Enjoy!


What People Are Talking About

It's true. This is basically the theme of *Amonkhet* previews—"cycling for one makes everything so much better."

Let's see if we can assign band genres to today's preview cards:


* Cruel Reality: metalcore
* Bounty of the Luxa: lounge singers
* Approach of the Second Sun: '90s alternative
* Dissenter's Deliverance: high school garage band that took a politics class once
* Supply Caravan: Australian soft rock
* Winged Shepherd: '80s pop (mostly ballads)
* Nimble-Blade Khenra: punk rock, but, like, kind of obsessed with anime
* Angel of Sanctions: symphonic power metal
* New Perspectives: '80s synth band

Synergy of the Day
==================


1. Key to So Many Snakes

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Key+to+the+City)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Key+to+the+City)
We've gotten to know one Snake-based deck that uses +1/+1 counters, but it might be time for one that uses -1/-1 counters.


With these two cards on the table, every time you cycle a card you not only shrink your opponent's army, but get a 1/1 deathtouch Snake for each creature they control. Every time you cycle.


But there's another way that also lets you trigger Hapatra's first ability—[Key to the City](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Key+to+the+City). It might have been fashioned for another city on another world, but the Key works just as well on *Amonkhet*, where you can discard a card to get Hapatra through to start throwing -1/-1 counters on things and making Snakes. And when the Archfiend shows up later on? Boom—every [Key to the City](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Key+to+the+City) activation also shrinks their entire team, makes a bunch of Snakes, *and* continues to get Hapatra through.
