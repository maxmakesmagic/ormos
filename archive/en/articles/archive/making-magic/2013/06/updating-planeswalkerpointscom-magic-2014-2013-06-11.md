PlaneswalkerPoints.com is updated and it looks awesome! Featuring the fire-topped Chandra, it is clear we are leaving the city-plane of Ravnica behind as we turn toward the upcoming **Magic** 2014 Core Set. I enjoyed our stay on Ravnica, but I've got the wanderlust to go explore somewhere new, and a new core set is just what I need.


### What is Planeswalker Points?


Planeswalker Points is the program where **Magic** players earn points by playing in sanctioned **Magic** events. These points rank you against your friends and **Magic** players around the world.


### New Look


I will miss my Boros on my [PlaneswalkerPoints.com](http://www.wizards.com/magic/planeswalkerpoints), but the new theme for **Magic** 2014 looks fantastic! Hopefully you all will adjust to the new look and feel without too much trouble.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feat251_screenshot.jpg)Along with the new skin on PlaneswalkerPoints.com, we've rolled out some feature updates and bug fixes, as well as the new suite of achievements. Let's take a look at the new achievements players can earn!


### ***Magic** 2014* Prerelease Achievements


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feat251_arta.jpg)There are six achievements to earn by playing in the ***Magic*** 2014 Prerelease. Five of these are tied to the latest core set's pantheon of Planeswalkers. At the Prerelease, there are five Planeswalker achievement to pursue. For each one you complete, you'll get a card with a unique code to enter into PlaneswalkerPoints.com and earn the "Disciple" achievement for that Planeswalker.


If you earn all five Planeswalker Disciple achievements you'll receive the "[Planeswalker's Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planeswalker%27s+Favor)" achievement.


### 20th Anniversary


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feat251_artc.jpg)As some of you may know, this is **Magic**'s 20th anniversary. One way to commemorate this year is to earn the "**Magic** 20th Anniversary Gauntlet Runner" achievement, which requires you to participate in events of all the following types, starting from today through the end of 2013:



* Sanctioned Casual Event
* Prerelease
* Friday Night **Magic**
* Game Day

### **Magic** Celebration 2013 Participation


There is a **Magic** Celebration on September 7, 2013, for the ***Magic** 2014 Core Set*. **Magic** Celebration is an event where stores provide free events to players, inviting new players especially to come compete for prizes and celebrate the awesome game of **Magic**. Everyone who participates in the event will earn a special achievement!


There are a handful of other achievements that we will be unveiling when their time comes and a few surprises that might pop up. Go check out the new PlaneswalkerPoints.com and see what new achievements you've earned and what level you're up to!
