In his answer to a recent [Ask Wizards](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/asksearchablearchive&term=deathwurms), **Magic** creative director Brady Dommermuth explained that the *Legions* card [Bane of the Living](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+of+the+Living) is supposed to be an insect-like black creature "with imprints of its victims faces in agony clearly visible in its underbelly."


Because the art is so dark (and small) on the card, those faces are very difficult to see. Here is a blown-up version of Justin Sweet's art with the brightness and contrast raised significantly. Now if you look at the insect's belly, you can see the little human faces.
