D*arksteel* artifact creatures with the Modular keyword, such as [Arcbound Slith](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr106), have their design roots in *Visions'* chimeras: **[Brass-Talon Chimera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brass-Talon+Chimera)**, **[Iron-Heart Chimera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron-Heart+Chimera)**, **[Lead-Belly Chimera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lead-Belly+Chimera)**, and **[Tin-Wing Chimera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tin-Wing+Chimera)**. Each of the four chimerae are 2/2 artifact creatures for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif). Each has an ability that it can transfer to other Chimera brethren when it dies. And each was illustrated by Mike Dringenberg, artist behind several other *Mirage* block cards and, more recently, the [Talisman of Indulgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Talisman%2Bof%2BIndulgence), [Damping Matrix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damping+Matrix) and [Jinxed Choker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jinxed+Choker). 


In the Chimera illustration below ([Brass-Talon Chimera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brass-Talon+Chimera)), note how the parchment behind the creature bears a sketch of a fantastic cat creature. It actually is the Brass-Talon itself, merged with the other chimerae.



If you look closely, all the Chimerae have this "cat-tomaton" and other Chimera images somewhere the background. If you were to line up all the background images, the foreground Chimerae would come together as a sort of collage, and it would look something like this:
