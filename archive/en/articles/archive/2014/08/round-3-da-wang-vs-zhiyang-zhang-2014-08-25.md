 Zhiyang Zhang is one of China's better-recognised players, being a member of the winning Worlds team in 2009. This weekend, he's piloting a Mono-Black build against Da Wang's Esper control. The matchup is reminiscent of similar decks across formats dating back to **Magic**'s infancy: the crux of the games will be whether Wang can stabilise against an efficient, disruptive strategy in time for his more-powerful-in-the-abstract control cards to take the match. With Mono-Black riding high in the current format, a lot will come down to the few 'free' slots that each player has tinkered with from the more common 'stock' lists, as drawn from the many recent events featuring both popular decks.




 Both games would feature early aggression and disruption from Zhang, but Wang was able to stabilise in both instances, the power of multiple Planeswalkers being too much for even [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s to punch their way through.




**Game 1**




 Zhang had the first meaningful action with a [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s. Wang was unfazed, Dissolving a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and calmly dropping lands to [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) the Rats. Zhang stalled on lands, casting an [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) but losing out on tempo by not being able to activate it immediately. Wang had a [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) to push himself further ahead on cards, while Zhang summoned another [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s and offed the Jace with a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault).




 Wang used another Sphere to wipe out Zhang's [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections), giving Zhang a window to divest himself of a [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie). Wang's hand was full of gas: an Elspeth, a [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) and a [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) stared down the Zombie. As the damage started to stack up, Wang fired a [Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revelation)s for 4 and summoning an Elspeth to clog the ground up.






*Wang wistfully wonders, 'Whence will my Wrath wreak woe on these worrisome wretches?'*
