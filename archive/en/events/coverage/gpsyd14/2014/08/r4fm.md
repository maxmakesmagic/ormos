 Many years ago, Anatoli Lightfoot won an Australian Grand Prix in Brisbane, and had been quite the fixture in the Australian *Magic* scene up to that point, but he then decided to take some time away from the game. Having now returned to reclaim any glory that might by lying around, he's had to start out the hard way, and is now 3-0 without any byes.




 Sitting across from him is Kelvin Chew. While Chew lacks any GP top 8's, he finished in the Top 8 at Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* a couple of years back. He's also been on the Singapore National Team, and finished just outside of the top 8 at GP Kuala Lumpur earlier this year.




 Both players jockeyed for position in the early game, convoking combat tricks at each other, until Chew summoned a [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker) to his side. Lightfoot called everyone together to help him point a [Covenant of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covenant+of+Blood) at the Planeswalker, but Chew followed it up with a [Soul of Shandalar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Shandalar).



"Oh I see!" Lightfoot exclaimed, before scooping up his cards. 





*Anatoli Lightfoot faces down a Planeswalker and an Avatar.*

  

**Chew 1 – Lightfoot 0**




 "Fire! A Frog's nemesis," Lightfoot joked as Chew played a [Wall of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Fire) across from Lightfoot's [Witch's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witch%27s+Familiar). Lightfoot then played a [Shadowcloak Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowcloak+Vampire) to go over the wall, but Chew had the [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) to burn it out of the sky. A [Forge Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forge+Devil) from Chew took out a [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night), making way again for his [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker). Lightfoot employed a [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) to help take down the Planeswalker, before playing a Nissa of his own. Chew just tapped all of his own lands to again follow up with his [Soul of Shandalar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Shandalar).






*Kelvin Chew is a powerful wizard.*

  

 Lightfoot considered his position. If you took the [Soul of Shandalar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Shandalar) out of the picture, the creatures on either side looked relatively even, and Lightfoot did have his own [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker). However, he couldn't just ignore the [Soul of Shandalar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Shandalar) that sat smugly amongst Chew's team. Lightfoot shook his head. "There's no way you can mess this up enough that I can win against that," he admitted, again scooping up his cards.




**Kelvin Chew defeats Anatoli Lightfoot 2-0**
