**Letter of the Week**

Brandon has a question about the flavor of [Ice Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage).

> [Ice Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage) is a pretty decent limited card, but horrible in constructed. Obviously, it's because of the fact that it gets destroyed when the creature it's imprisoning is targeted. My question is simple. Why? Why does targeting a creature frozen in ice suddenly thaw it? I can understand why a [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) would break the cage, because the creature is suddenly too large for its former confinement, but why would changing a creature's color with something like [Cerulean Wisps](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cerulean+Wisps) cause the cage to fail? Why would equipping a creature with a [Sword of Light and Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Light+and+Shadow) break the ice? How would the creature even be able to grab the sword without being able to move?

I love this question. Everybody's got slightly different intuitions about flavor, Brandon, and so what feels satisfyingly flavorful to one player might seem off to another. You're a man with exacting flavor standards, and I applaud that. "Being targeted" is indeed a very broad phenomenon in the world of **Magic**, and there are plenty of examples of targeting that don't seem functional or powerful enough to break a magical cage of ice.

However, those odd examples indicate a strength of the game, not a weakness. A properly flavorful card is a sweet spot between flavor and game complexity. It's not a failing that [Ice Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage) is broken by things other than [Bonesplitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter)s, [Quietus Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quietus+Spike)s, and targeted spells with Fire in their namesâ€”those lines of text would make the card and the game's rules needlessly complex and unfun, and arguably still wouldn't get across the flavor of a cage of ice any better than the targeting trigger (and I doubt such specific conditions would make people *enjoy* flavor). A stylish, simple line of text is easy to remember, fast to play, and more fun than a litany of drawbacky flavor clauses.

Sure, there will always be times when you can come up with nonsensical flavor situations, but that's an indication of the beauty and freedom of the game. We write the text on the spells, but you get to decide how to cast them.
