Every match at the World Championship promises to be an epic one. It was impossible not to be, when 24 of the best have converged for the greatest tournament of the year. Today, we're kick-starting the weekend with a *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* Booster Draft, as well as a showdown between pair of Canadian Pro Tour Champions.


There are a lot of similarities between the pair of close-knitted friends. Both players are 27 years old this year, and this also happens to be both players' second appearance at the World Championship, a testament to their consistency and prowess.


Alexander Hayne and Shaun McLaren ascended to superstardom when they won their respective Pro Tours, both in Spain, no less. Hayne was the champion at Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* in Barcelona, while McLaren took down Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* in Valencia.


Hayne's been on quite a tear in the past season, clocking an alarming 42 uncapped Pro Points on the Grand Prix Circuit. He is showing no signs of slowing down, seeing how he had won Canada's first round of World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers last weekend.


With that victory, it means that the upcoming World *Magic* Cup in Barcelona will mark the second time that both players will be representing Canada.

"This match kind of decides who calls the shots at the World *Magic* Cup!" exclaimed Hayne with his trademark smile.


McLaren raised an eyebrow. "Oh, really?"


The humble Canadian National Champion was too polite to reply with a more retaliating retort.


**The Decks**


McLaren has assembled a white-black-green tokens deck, featuring [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession), [Scatter the Seeds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds), and [Ant Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ant+Queen). Left unchecked, McLaren could very easily flood the board with Eldrazi Spawn, Spirit, and Saproling tokens before delivering the final punch with [Wilt-Leaf Liege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wilt-Leaf+Liege), [Fortify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortify), or a pair of [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede).


Hayne's five-color deck has a red, green, and blue base, with light splashes to maximize domain and sunburst. The two [Simic Growth Chamber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber)s and a trio of [Fiery Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Fall)s would help Hayne fix his mana to cast his powerful spells, in particular the [Savage Twister](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Twister) and [All is Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+is+Dust) that was crucial in this matchup.


**"**Your deck looks pretty sweet," Hayne said. "How many *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* drafts did you do last week?"


**"**Not too many, actually," McLaren replied. "Fifteen. Just enough to draft all the other decks that *aren't* this deck!"


With that, they proceeded to roll the die, and Hayne won the right to play first. This is the first match of the weekend where players will be utilizing the Vancouver Mulligan, which is also has "somewhat-Canadian" origins. Fortunately, both players were happy with their initial seven.


**The Games**


[Tukatongue Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tukatongue+Thallid) and [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) were McLaren's first creatures, which helped to power out [Conclave Phalanx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conclave+Phalanx) and [Scatter the Seeds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds). In a matter of four turns, McLaren had assembled a team of seven creatures. The accompanying [Scion of the Wild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+the+Wild)s was pretty intimidating too!


Hayne could only put up [Dragonsoul Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonsoul+Knight) and [Lorescale Coatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lorescale+Coatl), the latter which McLaren promptly killed with [Grim Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Affliction). At the cost of losing a couple of smaller dorks, McLaren attacked with his team on successive turns to reduce Hayne down to 2 life.

Hayne tried to restore balance to the board, creating a zoo on his side with [Bestial Menace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bestial+Menace) and [Plaxcaster Frogling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plaxcaster+Frogling). That's one Elephant, one Wolf, one Snake, and a Frog Mutant for those counting the variety of animals at home.


However, McLaren ended things right there with a top-decked [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede).


McLaren once again opened with [Tukatongue Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tukatongue+Thallid) and [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) in the second game, while Hayne made use of his first two turns to fix his mana with [Simic Growth Chamber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber).


A Mountain helped Hayne cast [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) to kill the opposing 2/2, while his Swamp enabled him to summon a fully-sunbursted [Etched Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Oracle). Hayne then added Plains to the board, enabling a 5/5 [Skyreach Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyreach+Manta). [Plaxcaster Frogling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plaxcaster+Frogling) created a safety net for Hayne, since it was able to grant a form of shroud to all of his creatures.


Despite Hayne's creatures being very powerful, they were not numerous. His army of three was quickly outnumbered.

McLaren showed off how powerful convoke was, flooding the board with [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession) and [Scatter the Seeds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds). He pulled ahead with [Lodestone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) and [Kozilek's Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator).


Hayne decided he's seen enough and decided to pull the trigger on [All is Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+is+Dust).


After the dust had settled, Hayne had [Etched Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Oracle) and [Skyreach Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyreach+Manta) by his side, while McLaren was left with [Lodestone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem), three Eldrazi Spawn tokens, and a Saproling token generated from the dead [Tukatongue Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tukatongue+Thallid).


Revealing the first of two [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede)s from his hand, McLaren proceeded to give his entire team +5/+5 and trample. After some quick math, Hayne extended the hand in defeat.


"I guess you'll be the boss at the World *Magic* Cup," Hayne said.


McLaren could only smile and return the handshake.


**Hayne 0 - McLaren 2**
