### October 20-22, 2006: Jan-Moritz Merkel Wins Pro Tour–Kobe

In the world of *Time Spiral* draft, Jan-Moritz Merkel proved himself the king. Drafting a blue-green creature-heavy deck with strong morph undertones, Merkel faced Willy Edel's army of saprolings in the Kobe finals. Merkel captured victory by morphing his [Brine Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brine+Elemental) after Edel's miscalculated alpha strike. That locked Edel's defenses and the pseudo-Time Walk allowed Merkel's [Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron) to strike twice to seal the win.
