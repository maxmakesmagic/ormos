TwitchCon is taking over the San Diego Convention Center September 27–29 to cover the city in purple—and *Magic: The Gathering* will be there!


A community meetup, a LAN takeover, special guests, a panel, play area, and even some swag—if you're there for *Magic*, *Magic* is there for you.


So What Are We Doing?
=====================


***Magic: The Gathering*** **Community Meetup**
