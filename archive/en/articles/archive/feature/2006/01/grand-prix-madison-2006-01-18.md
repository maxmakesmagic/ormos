The **Magic: The Gathering** Grand Prix tournament series is an international circuit of large-scale Qualifier tournaments featuring cash prizes and multiple invitations to Pro Tour events.

Grand Prix—Madison is presented by Legion Events

### Format

* Team Standard-constructed format
* Unified deck construction rules are in effect. With the exception of basic land cards, a team’s combined decks and sideboards may not contain more than four of any individual card.
* Deck lists are required

**Rounds**

* The number of Swiss rounds on day 1 is determined by the following formula applied to the chart below:   
 EFFECTIVE ATTENDANCE (in Teams) =   
 REGISTRERED TEAMS +(1-round byes x .56) + (2-round byes x 2.38)  


|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Effective Attendance** | **Number of Day 1 Swiss Rounds** |
| 256 or less | 8 |
| 257 or more | 9 |
* Day 2 will have 5 Swiss rounds, followed by the single-elimination finals
* All Swiss rounds are 50 minutes in length; Top 4 single-elimination finals have no time limit
* When time is called, the active player will finish the turn and five additional turns will be taken

**Advancement**

* All Teams may participate in the Day 1 Swiss rounds
* If the number of *Registered Teams* is less then 225, the Top 20 teams will advance from day 1 to day 2. If the number of *Registered Teams* is 225 or greater, the Top 30 teams will advance from day 1 to day 2.
* The top 4 teams after the final Swiss round will advance to the top 4 single-elimination finals.

**Communication**

* All verbal communication among team members is permitted. Written communication is not permitted.
* Though players on a team may verbally communicate and gesture freely they must still complete game actions at a reasonable pace or they are engaging in slow play. The burden of reasonable pace is on the active player.
* Debate or discussion between players on the same team other than extremely brief consultation will be considered slow play.

**Top 4**

* Team Standard
* Top 4 matches will be best 2 of 3
* In the semi-finals, the first seeded Team will play the fourth seeded Team and the second seeded Team will play the third seeded Team

**Notes**

* 40K, REL 4
* Players are responsible for knowing all DCI and [high-level tournament rules](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=protour/images/HighlevelRules.pdf).
* Players must bring pen, paper, card sleeves and appropriate counters.
