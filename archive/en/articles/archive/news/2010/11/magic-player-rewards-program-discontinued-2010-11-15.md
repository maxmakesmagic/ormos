After a rigorous evaluation, Wizards of the Coast has decided to eliminate the **Magic**  Player Rewards Program. It is important to us to provide you, the player, with the best possible **Magic: The Gathering**  experiences. In this case we are redirecting these resources to increase our player support for local organized play programs.

The December 2010 mailing will be the final MPR mailing and will include extra cards in addition to the cards you would have normally received. This mailing will encompass all reported tournament activity through November 15, 2010. We appreciate the dedication of our fans and look forward to providing new and exciting **Magic**  play experiences.
