| [Grim Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Affliction). [Volt Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volt+Charge) is a close second, but [Grim Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Affliction) is way better in the decks that it's actually good in. | [Pith Driller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pith+Driller). | [Volt Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volt+Charge). |

| [Grim Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Affliction). | [Volt Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volt+Charge). | It's a toss-up between [Blinding Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Souleater) and [Volt Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volt+Charge). I think that [Blinding Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Souleater) is a stronger card overall, but I've had a lot of success drafting mono-red. |
