As some of you may know, I'm quite partial to numbers. Numbers rock, and when you get to type things like this less than 20 feet away from over 2200 decklists, the little Excel icon in the corner of the laptop starts to look really appealing. However, we don't have days and weeks to number crunch our way through 2200 lists. What to do?

How about we take a select group of decklists, say an incredibly significant number of decklists, like 33? How about we make sure that these people know their stuff? Let's make sure that these are people like Pro Tour Champions Charles Gindy, Craig Wescoe, Stanislav Cifka, Darwin Kastle, and Ben Stark. Let's add in the combined Top 8 knowledge of Chris Fennell, Martin Juza, Frank Skarren, Neal Oliver, Conley Woods, Pat Cox, Matt Costa, Stephen Mann, Marijn Lybaert....look, you get the idea. The deal is, even if you haven't heard of some of them, I have, and I trust them to provide solid data. So here it is:



**The Colors of *Magic***



Boy oh boy is this ever a gold format. Of our 33 players, even the least popular colors – red and green – were both utilized by almost 75% (24/33). Just ahead of them was blue with 25 players, while first place was shared. 27/33 played white, and the same number played black. 



**How Many Colors?**



So clearly people were playing many colors, but how many? The spread looks like this: 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 2 colors |  1 player |
| 3 colors |  11 players |
| 4 colors |  13 players |
| 5 colors |  8 players |
