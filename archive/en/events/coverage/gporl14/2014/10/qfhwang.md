With qualification already assured for the Pro Tour in Washington D.C. next February, the pressure is at least partially off Harry Corvese and Eugene Hwang. There's cash and a trophy on the line, but thankfully no stomach-churning pit of despair for a losing quarterfinalist who also misses out on a PT slot. Neither player are strangers to knockout play. Hwang made the Top 8 of GP Vancouver earlier this year, while Corvese is a repeat offender – this is his fourth shot at taking home a trophy. After a day full of green black decks, Corvese was running Jeskai, while Hwang was solidly Mardu.



**Game 1**




 The Jeskai deck was typically tempo in the early stages, but not necessarily to Corvese's best advantage. He had mulliganed to six, and remained stuck on four mana for several turns, meaning that his [Crippling Chill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Chill) and [Force Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Away) were more gap-stoppers than back-breaking tempo plays. Still, the damage was accumulating. Hwang simply replayed/untapped his relevant forces, and pressed his advantage. Corvese was using any number of spells to keep in the game – another [Force Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Away), [Deflecting Palm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflecting+Palm) – and suddenly Hwang was in range of fiery death. He looked to take out [Mystic of the Hidden Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+of+the+Hidden+Way), but Corvese had done enough damage for [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm) to be lethal.
