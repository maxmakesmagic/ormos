Santiago was full of surprises.



 There were a lot of Souls and Whips in the Top 8 of [Grand Prix Santiago](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsan14), although what is most surprising is that [Savage Knuckleblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Knuckleblade) was actually tied with [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) at twelve copies each. Three of the five clans made an appearance, with Jeskai and Mardu not making the cut, and only one non-clan deck made Top 8. Today I want to take a look at some of the decks that came out of that Top 8, as well a deck that won a tournament in my hometown of Oakland. Plus, I'd feel remiss in my duties if I didn't mention [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) at least once, so I'll talk a bit about the Legacy Delver deck that is likely what I'd play right now.



Temur
=====

 There were three Temur Monsters decks in the Top 8, and all were pretty similar. The combination of mana Elves, giant ferocious monsters, [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws), [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike)s, and [Temur Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Charm)s is apparently an effective recipe, even if it isn't doing anything particularly broken. All the deck is trying to do is play hasty creatures that have a great power/toughness to mana cost ratio, use them to attack the opponent, and cast [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)s and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s until the opponent dies. That sounds like 1994 *Magic* to me (at least before people started discovering cards like [Mind Twist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Twist) and [Winter Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter+Orb), of course), and it's pretty cool to see that it's still viable.

![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ashcloud+Phoenix)


















 Pedro Carvalho played nearly the same list, while Fernando Barros found room for 2 Chandra, 4 [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon), and 4 [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster), although all three decks are basically trying to do the same things.




**Reasons this deck is great:**




* [Savage Knuckleblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Knuckleblade) is an absurd *Magic* card. It's cheap, huge, hasty, and protects itself, as well as becoming somehow *more* giant if the situation demands it. This is basically the reason to splash blue in a red-green deck.
* [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws) is the best [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) variant we've seen in a while. [Demonfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire), [Banefire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banefire), and [Devil's Play](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devil%27s+Play) were all good and all saw play, but [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws) blows them out of the water. The efficiency of playing this as a [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) in the same turn as casting a Knuckleblade or Phoenix is incredible, and cards are made or broken on small edges like that. Having your cheap early-game removal spell also capable of killing [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) or dealing 10 to the opponent is huge.
* [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds), Polukranos, and [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix) all match up favorably against most creatures in the format. Heir trades for creatures that cost more, Ashcloud is often a two-for-one, and Polukranos eats smaller creatures for free while being big enough to battle the larger ones.
* [Stubborn Denial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stubborn+Denial) is exactly the kind of sideboard card this deck needs to compete with decks that lean on spells. It allows the deck to keep playing threats while also stopping the opponent from doing anything relevant at minimal mana cost.
