John Avon is famous for his photorealistic yet fantastic landscapes. In *Champions of Kamigawa* he illustrated the cycle of allied-color lands (among others). The sketches John submitted for these pieces, though they are in black-and-white, serve to emphasize the blast of color in their respective final pieces. Click on the links below each sketch to see the final art. If you were art director, wouldn't you assign John to illustrate lands too?
