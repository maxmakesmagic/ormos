During the complex dance of a **Magic** card's design and development phases, cards often jump from one set to another. Sometimes it's a mechanics issue, sometimes it's about the power level of the environment - but more often than not, there's just not enough space in one and room to spare in another.


Take these three green-aligned cards as an example. Each was submitted as part of the design file of *Mirrodin* (then codenamed "Bacon"). But for various reasons they moved to "Lettuce," now known as *Darksteel*.


Note especially how different the "Bacon" version of the green-aligned golem turned out. All the color-affiliated golems in *Darksteel* had similar designs in the original "Bacon" file.
