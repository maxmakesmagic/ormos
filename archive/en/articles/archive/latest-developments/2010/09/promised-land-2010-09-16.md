Tom LaPille

Tom LaPille makes things. Some of the things he makes are card sets, like Dark Ascension and Born of the Gods. Sometimes he makes stories, too. Sometimes he makes unexpected things, like 16th-century Japanese clothing. He's probably making something right now.

M**agic** developers spend a lot of time thinking about what makes Constructed **Magic** fun. All of us have spent thousands of hours thinking about and playing many different Constructed formats. This has given us lots of opportunity to develop opinions about what we like. Although we sometimes disagree on the small details, most of the time we all agree on what makes for good **Magic**. You can see the results of our opinions when you look at Standard.

One of the things that we all agree on is that **Magic** is more fun when there are more options in deck building. This conclusion has plenty of consequences; one of them, for example, is that the best cards should all be balanced against one another so that no one deck dominates competitive play. Another is that there should be enough strong multicolor lands in a format to support multicolor decks of many different color combinations. If the multicolor lands are so weak that only monocolored decks have stable enough mana bases, the inability to make functional multicolor decks will make the space of reasonable decks much smaller.
