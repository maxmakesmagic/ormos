One of the themes of the sets set on Innistrad is the number thirteen, the unlucky number that many people, airlines, et cetera try to avoid. Are pro players afraid of the number thirteen as well? And, somewhat more important to the events this weekend, who is scared (or fond) of the card [Triskaidekaphobia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskaidekaphobia)?

No. 8 Sam Black:** This is another card which really impressed me. It definitely overperformed. That would also be a very good answer to the previous question [about underrated cards].

Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* semifinalist Patrick Dickmann:** Not afraid of the number thirteen. Not afraid of [Triskaidekaphobia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskaidekaphobia) either. Of course, you can always lose to it, but I think it's not great, not a card I want to have in my deck.

Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* quarterfinalist Pascal Maynard:** I don't mind the number thirteen, but I hate the card. I think it's really bad. It's going to kill you most of the time, and you will lose to it more often than you will win with it. I'm never going to look for the scenario where it's good.

Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas:** Yes, I'm afraid. I think [Triskaidekaphobia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskaidekaphobia) is quite good, and I'm afraid of playing against it. Often, especially when you don't know that they have it, they can achieve getting you down to 13, and then you have one turn before you are dead.

Two-time World Champion Shahar Shenhar:** I'm not personally scared of the number thirteen, although I would be if my opponent had that card in play. I think black decks should usually have it in their main deck, not in their sideboard. It's a risk, but it offers inevitability and it can definitely win games. It's by no means a bomb though, just a fine card to play.

Gold-level pro (missing four points to lock Platinum) Oliver Polak-Rottmann:** I like the card. I'm still not sure whether I think it's good. So far I lost against it when Frank [Karsten] played it, but I also won a couple of times against it. Personally I would never force such a strategy. With just one copy it's randomly either good or terrible, but if you get two then you have an insane game plan. Quite literally.
