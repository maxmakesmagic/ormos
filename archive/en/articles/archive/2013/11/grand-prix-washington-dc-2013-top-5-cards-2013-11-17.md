### 5. [Golgari Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Charm)


When the various Return to Ravnica Charms were first released, there was fairly widespread consensus that [Golgari Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Charm) was among the worst of the bunch. Boros, Azorius, Selesnya and even [Rakdos Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Charm) all were hyped for some reason or another.


But when you move into Legacy, [Golgari Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Charm) reigns supreme. Not only does it have some anti-enchantment utility, it's one of the best answers to [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) in the format. It also happens to be strong against Elves, Goblins and other random one-toughness creatures. The card was instrumental in letting Ted McCluskie fight through a True-Name-heavy field with BUG, and no Black-Green Legacy player should leave home without it.

### 4. [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith)


Banned in Modern, certainly no one doubts the power of [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith). But the versatility is really what makes it so special. Able to serve as a mana accelerator alongside [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor), a win condition alongside [Craterhoof Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craterhoof+Behemoth), and a utility tool with any number of creatures, [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) was instrumental in both (10) Sam Black's Bant deck and Andrew Cuneo's Elf list in the Top 8. Cuneo's deck was made all the more consistent with the sorcery while Black was easily able to search out [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary), [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze), [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) and more to keep opponents off balance.

### 3. [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand)


[Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) was once hyped as a format-ending monster that would demand immediate banning once its true power was known. While that never came to be, he has proven to be the defacto-monster, alongside [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn), to [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate), [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack), [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) or otherwise cheat into play. Often leading to a game-ending flurry of cards, [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) enables all kinds of strategies. Drew Tunison's Dredge deck, for instance, won a number of games by casting [Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread) return on the Legendary Demon and immediately dredging nearly his entire deck. Other brave players paired the 7/7 with Children of Korlis for a super combo of sorts.

### 2. [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic)


It's interesting to think what Legacy would look like without [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic). Without it, Death and Taxes may lack the power to go with its taxing ability. Without it, Esper Stoneblade probably wouldn't exist. Without it, the Bant deck No. 10 Sam Black used to continue his incredible run might not exist. Without it, (22) Owen Turtenwald might not have won his first Grand Prix.


Time and again [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) enables so very much for just two mana, including uncounterable [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull)s and ways to win Jitte wars. It's so dangerous Sam Black was willing to set himself back with [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) on the draw just to keep Turtenwald from resolving a copy—twice—in the semifinals. And it was [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) holding [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) as Turtenwald attacked for his first Grand Prix win ever.


[Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) might just be the best card in Legacy. But it's not quite the card of the weekend.

### 1. [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis)


No card was more hyped coming into the weekend and no card did more to justify that hype than [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis). "Baby [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus)" is cheap, difficult to kill, and carries equipment exceedingly well. The first Blue creature to challenge [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) for "best combat-oriented creature" since ever, Nemesis proved itself to be a mirror- and pseudo-mirror breaker every step of the way. When Sam Black and Turtenwald faced off in the semifinals, it was [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) that proved to be the difference maker, as Turtenwald resolved his first...and second.


And if you don't believe me, Turtenwald called the 3/1 Merfolk "the real deal." So get used to fearing your True-Name, because it's now one of the most important cards in all of Legacy.
