 Owen Turtenwald has been playing high-profile *Magic* events for the better part of the last decade. Turtenwald first broke onto the competitive scene with a Top 8 at Grand Prix Columbus in 2007. Since then, he's gradually been on the up and up. Over the last year and a half, all of Turtenwald's hard work finally paid off. Turtenwald now has multiple Pro Tour Top 8s, multiple Grand Prix victories, and is currently ranked first in the world in the Top 25 Pro Rankings.




 I sat down with Turtenwald to discuss his relationship with *Magic*, his ability to progress, and his plans for the future.
