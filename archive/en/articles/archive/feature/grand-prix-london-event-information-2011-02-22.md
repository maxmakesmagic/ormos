### Artist Information


**Magic** artists Mark Tedin and Daren Bader will be in attendance.


**Mark Tedin**
  
 Mark came on board as a freelance artist at Wizards of the Coast in the summer of 1992. Since then, he's contributed artistically to nearly all the fantasy/adventure games the company produces, including most sets of **Magic: The Gathering**. When Mark's not working on Wizards of the Coast projects, he enjoys hanging out and drawing in Seattle cafes, designing sets for theatrical productions, or going to science fiction movies. In fact, it's Mark's fondness for the worlds of science fiction and fantasy that helped shape him into the artist he is today. 


From 1997-2000, Mark also worked on site at Wizards of the Coast as a staff conceptual artist. Since then, he's also been teaching illustration, visual composition, and figure drawing part-time at the Northwest College of Art near Seattle.
