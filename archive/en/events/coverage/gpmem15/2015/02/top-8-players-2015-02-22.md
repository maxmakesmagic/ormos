 Abzan Control designed by Steve Rubin. It’s very robust and had a great plan versus every other deck.

 I expected to play against other Abzan decks, Blue-Black Control, and White-Red/Jeskai decks. I didn;t play against very much Jeskai but otherwise everything was normal.

 Main deck: [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) got me out of some tough spots.  

 Sideboard: [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) - The aftr board plan versus basically every deck.




**How will you travel through time: *Back to the Future* or *Time Cop*?**   

 Back to the Future. I’d be Doc and Ben Friedman would be Marty.

**What did you expect to play against? Did you play what you expected to see?**  

 Abzan, Jeskai, White-Red, and Red-Green, although way more Abzan than expected




**What was the best card in your main deck and sideboard, and why?**  
[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time): It’s the card you hope to draw every game and gives you the tools to wins.




**How will you travel through time: *Back to the Future* or *Time Cop*?**   

 Back to the Future

 Abzan Aggro, White-Red, and Red-Green Devotion. I expected to see that.




**What was the best card in your main deck and sideboard, and why?**  
[Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). It swings games too easily in multiples.

**Age:** 27  
**Hometown:** Coralville, IA  
**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** 3-1 a Modern Daily Event with a four-of Seeance in my deck




**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

 White-Red Aggro. It had pretty even matchups across the board, and I get ot attack people with big, hastey Dragons.




**What did you expect to play against? Did you play what you expected to see?**  

 I expected a lot of mirror matches and Abzan Aggro. 3-0 versus the mirror and 5-0 versus Abzan Aggro.




**What was the best card in your main deck and sideboard, and why?**  

 Main Deck: Heliod’s Pilgrim. Northing better than [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) number five with a body.  

 Sideboad: [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds). The deck really wants 25 lands in the postboard games with six 5-drops. Also lets me cut the Mana [Confluence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confluence) in the mirror.




**How will you travel through time: *Back to the Future* or *Time Cop*?**   

 Time Cop; Jean Claude Van Damme can’t be stopped!

 Midrange decks, then White-Red and Jeskai, and Abzan Aggro




**What was the best card in your main deck and sideboard, and why?**  

 Elspeth, Sun’s Champion in the main deck. It lets you play both offense and defense, and handles problems.  
[Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) in the sideboard because people board out Lighting Strike and [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight).




**How will you travel through time: *Back to the Future* or *Time Cop*?**
