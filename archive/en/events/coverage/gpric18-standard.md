Day 2 Coverage



Alex Hon is your Grand Prix Richmond Standard Champion! Piloting Black-Red Aggro, he took out current Player of the Year leader Seth Manfield and former Player of the Year Mike Sigrist in the Top 8 and helped to cement this Standard as one where if you’re not red, you might just be dead.


Hon’s victory capped an epic weekend that started with the experiment of covering Reid Duke for every round of the Legacy Grand Prix. Even though Reid did not make it to the Top 8, his Ultimate Guard Teammate Andrew Cuneo did, where he made the most of his Top 8 by winning the whole thing. His three opponents in the elimination rounds? The three people Reid lost to in the Swiss.


It pays to have good teammates.


We also got a clearer picture of the Player of the Year Race. Reid Duke was not able to improve on his standing, but in his last round Luis Salvatto earned a victory to pull him into a dead heat with Duke for second place. They would have both been one point behind Seth Manfield if the Pro Tour *Ixalan* Champion had not made Top 8. His Top 4 finish has given him a three-point lead on the field with only two Grand Prix left to be played.


But Sunday was all about Hon, his Goblin Chainwhirlers and copies of Rekindling Phoenix. Congratulations to Alex Hon, your Grand Prix Richmond Standard Champion!
