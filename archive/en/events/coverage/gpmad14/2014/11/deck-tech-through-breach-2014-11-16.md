At the time of this writing, Ricardo van den Bogaard is one of the three remaining players sporting a perfect record. He just overcame Russia's Alexander Semkin and his Zoo Deck and when I collected him at the feature match table, I reminded him to not forget to de-sideboard after the match. "Oh, I didn't have to sideboard that game", van den Bogaard said, much to Semkin's dismay. We then made our way to the text coverage area and we started to get into a little more detail about his deck building process.



 If you didn't check out the decklist yet, you should do so now. What you might recognize at first is the presence of [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) and the absence of [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). While Valakut is putting in some work in the deck, it's definitely not the most important piece of the puzzle (or the second most important piece like in the [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) deck).




 But let's not get ahead of ourselves and start with the main reasons why van den Bogaard decided to pilot this deck this weekend: [Anger of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods) and [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void). Both cards work incredibly well against Delver builds, which was the supposedly most popular deck going into the weekend. With a positive match-up against it, van den Bogaard felt like he was making the right choice.





*Ricardo van den Bogaard is doing well this weekend with a very unique build!*
