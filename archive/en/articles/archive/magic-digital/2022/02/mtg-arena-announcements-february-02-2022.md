Double Feature Draft
====================


Now through February 10, join in a monster of a draft event, featuring a special blend of both *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* and *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* cards. In the [Double Feature Draft](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-double-feature-event-2022-01-19), you can also get Dracula card styles!


Note: We're aware of the bug that causes only a single card style to be offered. We'll be granting *two* card styles to accounts for each entry beyond the first as an upgrade for the inconvenience. These will be granted during the week after the release of *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* on February 10.


Bug Fix Coming: Card Styles on Rebalanced Cards
===============================================


There is a bug that prevents card styles from being applied to rebalanced cards, and we want to assure players that card styles should and will work with rebalanced cards. A fix is in the works to correct this issue and will be released with the launch of *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* on February 10.
