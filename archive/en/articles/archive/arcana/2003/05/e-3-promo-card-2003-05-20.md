Below is an oversized promotional *Eighth Edition* [Two-Headed Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Two-Headed+Dragon) card given away at E-3 (Electronic Entertainment Exposition) last weekend. The card features the normal card front for *Eighth* (with a black border, which the *Eighth* premium cards will have), and an enlarged version of the card art on the back.

Similar promotional cards that preview *Eighth Edition* will be given away at other events this summer, including Origins, GenCon, and the San Diego ComiCon.
