After a long day's drafting, two players emerged from the smoke with 6-0 records: Chris Kwan and Ben Seck. These two players have put themselves in the box seat needing to capture only 2 wins and a draw out of the 6 rounds tomorrow, and they'll play each other in the first round tomorrow. Despite complaints that he had been screwed in the final draft of the day, Ben Seck managed to pilot his Domainesque draft deck to a 3-0 record a feat that is truly commendable. Chris Kwan's b/r draft deck taking him all the way.


One of the major surprises of the day was that Dane Coltman, who many players tipped to do well in the draft, ended up dropping after a 2-3 record. He stands by his statements before the tournament that "Anyone can get screwed in a Rochester draft, all you need is a few players co-operating on one side and a hate drafter to your right and that can ruin your chances of posting a good result". Coltman isn't too unhappy though, "Sometimes nothing goes your way, it's just the way things are I'll just go out and have some fun with the guys tonight and tomorrow I'll have forgotten all about it."


A former Australian great not performing as well as was expected, Rod Ho said, "I am sick of not doing well at Nats, maybe I should practice for next year!" This leads to an interesting Top 8 heading into Day 2.with relative unknowns, Shun Jiang, Andrew Lai and Rob Nadebaum making a first showing.


All that's left now is the Standard format, after last years surprise showing of Stephen Campbell's "Boojum" deck, all someone needs is a little bit of innovation to carry them to a 6-0 record and a chance at the national team. Guessing what the players at the top will be playing is going to be one of the most important decisions that the contenders will make as a well chosen metagame deck like Skies could easy breeze them into the Top 8.
