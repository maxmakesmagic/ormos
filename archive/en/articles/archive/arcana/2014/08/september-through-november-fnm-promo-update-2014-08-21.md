Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






Tomorrow (or even today, depending on your part of the world and when you read this) is that glorious day of the week we like to call Friday (or Freitag, Vendreidi, or Viernes, if you're feeling international). And with Friday comes [Friday Night *Magic*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/event-types/friday-night-magic).


And with Friday Night *Magic* comes FNM Promos! Let's take a look at the promos you can pick up at FNM over the next few months.


September
=========


Add white staple [Banishing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light) to your collection in September.
