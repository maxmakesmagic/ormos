![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi04/fm1_1.jpg)For the Pack Draft event both of these players ended up with similar sets to build from. Finkel had PS/PS/AP/8/OD to Kibler's PS/PS/IN/8/SCG ### Game 1


Kibler played first in game 1 and started the action with a turn 3 [Caldera Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caldera+Kavu), followed up with a morph. Finkel was stuck on two [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s and a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) with a grip of blue cards and things were looking grim. [Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night)scape Master from Kibler didn't improve that outlook. Jon's next turn saw a Terminal Morraine, allowing him to cast a Zealot to try and throw together some kind of defense but Kibler's morph turned out to be Zombie Cuthroat, and Jon couldn't have been happy to see [Cavern Harpy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+Harpy) make an appearance. The pressure was far too much for Finkel and it was time to head to the sideboards. 


Brian Kibler: "You've seen my deck and you know every card is better than yours"


### Game 2


Jon chose to go first and was greeted with an opening hand that included [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) along with 4 creatures he knew he'd be able to cast this time around. Turn 2 [Lay of the Land](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lay+of+the+Land) for his splashed [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) meant that mana wouldn't be an issue this time around. Finkel started the pressure with turn 3 [Wind Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wind+Drake), turn 4 [Aven Cloudchaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser), turn 5 [Dreamwinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder). Kibler's opening was slower getting out of the gates with turn 4 [Trench Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trench+Wurm), but things sped up with a turn 5 kicked [Pouncing Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pouncing+Kavu). [Stormscape Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormscape+Battlemage) and [Gerrard's Wisdom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard%27s+Wisdom) quickly put the game away for Finkel however, and we were off to game 3. 


### Game 3


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi04/fm1_2.jpg) Finkel started out with a nice defensive body this game, dropping turn 2 [Canopy Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Spider). On turn three he got to switch to offense though, playing out [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). On Kibler's side of the table it was all fat, with turn 4 [Mire Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Kavu) (with a [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) in play), turn 5 [Hill Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant) followed by a mystery morph. A [Magnigoth Treefolk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magnigoth+Treefolk) from Finkel looked like it might gum the board up but Kibler kicked up a [Pouncing Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pouncing+Kavu) and sent the team. Finkel spent a long time figuring out his blocks and when the dust cleared both Kavu were in Kibler's 'yard as was Finkel's Spider, while the morph turned out to be [Zombie Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Cutthroat). The race was on, with Finkel at 14 and Kibler at 13. Play swung back and forth as the race continued, but as soon as Finkel hit 6 mana a [Confiscate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscate) on [Zombie Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Cutthroat) had Kibler on the ropes. Both players continued dumping out creatures and Kibler was able to stabilize a bit with [Hill Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant), [Mire Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Kavu), and a [Hunting Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Drake) that sent a [Stone Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Kavu) back to Finel's deck. Kibler was back in it, but with only 2 life to Finkel's 14. Kibler's board improved even more next turn, when a [Cavern Harpy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+Harpy) bounced his [Hunting Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Drake), allowing him to send the [Stone Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Kavu) to the deck yet again. Kibler was finally back on offense, but he was down to just 1 life to Finkel's 8. Jon put up what defense he could, but in the end his color splashing got the better of him, stranding 3 uncastable cards in his hand as [Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night)scape Master came down to finish him off.


Kibler wins 2-1
