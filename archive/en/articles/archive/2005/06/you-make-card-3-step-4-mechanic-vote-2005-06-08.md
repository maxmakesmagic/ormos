![You Make the Card 3](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/You_Make_the_Card_3sm.jpg)Let me begin by profusely apologizing for the delay in the latest round of You Make the Card. I don't want to give excuses. It took way, way longer than it should have. I am very sorry for that. We are looking into ways to try and improve this process in the future to prevent similar delays. That said, let's pick out a mechanic.


Previously in You Make the Card #3, you [chose](/en/node/624296) this piece of art:

...to design a card around. You then [selected](/en/node/624296) to make the card an instant or sorcery. With that in mind, you were asked to submit a mechanic for the card that fit all the already chosen criteria. Let's just say a lot of you opted to do just that. Over 10,000 of you.


After months of exhaustive work, we have slimmed down the candidates to the Top 10. And since I've made you wait so long, I will not make you wait any longer. Here are the Top 10 Mechanics (in no particular order):


### Mechanic A



> Put all local enchantment cards in all graveyards that could enchant target creature into play under your control enchanting that creature.


### Mechanic B



> You can't lose the game this turn.


### Mechanic C



> As an additional cost to play CARDNAME, sacrifice a creature.  
> 
> Put NUMBER creature tokens into play that are 1/1 copies of the sacrificed creature.


### Mechanic D



> Target player gains protection from the color of your choice until end of turn.


### Mechanic E



> Remove all permanents you control from the game. Take an extra turn after this one. At the end of that turn, return to play under their owner's control all cards removed from the game this way.


### Mechanic F



> You win the game if there are no cards in your library.


### Mechanic G



> Copy target activated or triggered ability. You may choose new targets for the copy. *(Mana abilities can't be targeted.)*


### Mechanic H



> Counter target spell. Search your library for a card with the same name as that spell, reveal it, and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your library.


### Mechanic I



> Each player chooses a target artifact, creature, enchantment, or land card in an opponent's graveyard. Then each player puts that card into play under his or her control.


### Mechanic J



> Remove target creature from the game and draw cards equal to its power. At the beginning of your next upkeep, return it to play and discard cards equal to its toughness.


Please note that I will release the names of the mechanics' designers after voting. Credit will go to the first person to turn in the mechanic.


And now it is your turn to whittle things down. The deadline for this vote is when the site updates on Sunday June 12th at midnight. (Hey, 10 down to 1 is a little easier than 10,000 to 10.) So what will Rebekah Lynn's art do? It's now in your hands.
