As MagicTheGathering.com readers know, during the early stages of a card's R&D life cycle it is given a playtest name. Sometimes this temporary name sticks, and winds up on the finished card. Most often it's replaced with a new name at the time it's associated with its new art.


But sometimes these replaced playtest names sneak their way back into **Magic**. Consider these four *Mirage* playtest cards and their real equivalents. Then look at the names of the playtest cards -- can you remember on what cards all those names ended up?
