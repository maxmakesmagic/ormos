These players were on a maximal twelve points going into the round. Florent will be familiar to many of you based on his performances with the Ruel brothers in the Black Ops. Pierre is probably unknown, as his first PT was recently in Venice where he went 2-3. However, he is qualified for Yokohama as well, so he may be more well-known in the future

### Game 1

![Goblin Sharpshooter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Sharpshooter)Pierre went first and the two players made early creatures that ignored each other. Florent had a [Festering Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin) and a [Severed Legion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) against two [Mistform Dreamer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Dreamer)s for Pierre B. Pierre's hand was rather good as well – he had a [Gempalm Incinerator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Incinerator) which could kill any of Florent's creatures with a little help from the illusions.  Jeudon made a morph, Pierre a [Goblin Sharpshooter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sharpshooter). The Sharpshooter and Incinerator combined to leave Jeudon with only the [Festering Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin) in play. He made a [Toxin Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toxin+Sliver), but it was returned to his hand by [Echo Tracer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echo+Tracer) and in any case the [Mistform Dreamer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Dreamer)s would have been enough. Pierre's deck looked extremely good in that game. 

Pierre B. 1 – Florent Jeudon 0

### Game 2

![Echo Tracer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Echo+Tracer)Florent chose to go second. "Florent really, really, likes card advantage," Pierre explained. Pierre B. made turn three Dreamer and turn four Sharpshooter. The Sharpshooter was [Swat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat)ted. Florent made a [Sootfeather Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sootfeather+Flock) which could block and survive thanks to [Daru Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Healer). Pierre [Solar Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Blast)ed it, but didn't draw a fifth land.  Jeudon made a [Lowland Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lowland+Tracker) so that he could deal with at least one of the flyers, but Pierre made a morph and held back so it would just be a trade. Florent played [Aven Soulgazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Soulgazer) and gazed at [Echo Tracer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echo+Tracer), then made a very shady looking attack with the [Lowland Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lowland+Tracker), since he had just seen that he couldn't kill anything with it thanks to the Tracer. Instead Pierre B. bounced the Tracker as he had a plan. 

 Florent replayed it, and Pierre made his Dreamer a [Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier) and cast [Peer Pressure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Pressure) to steal it. Jeudon had nothing but land and had to say go. Pierre B. then drew a sixth land to morph/unmorph a second [Echo Tracer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echo+Tracer) in the same turn. Florent cast [Akroma's Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Blessing). It only held off the inevitable for a turn. Pierre drew [Backslide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Backslide), and got a second use out of his [Echo Tracer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echo+Tracer). 

**Final Result:** Pierre B. 2 – Florent Jeudon 0 

Pierre's deck was much better than Florent's, so the result was correct even though Jeudon drew a lot of land in both games.
