All Esper knowledge is encoded in twenty-three tomes called "The Filigree Texts", kept at the Sanctum Arcanum. The texts can be seen in the art for [Brilliant Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brilliant+Ultimatum), but unfortunately we don't have a filigree-to-English dictionary handy. Phooey! Still, they look pretty cool all blown up like this:

On the card itself, Tezzeret is creeping into the Sanctum to learn the secrets of Esper. You can see him poking his head through the doorway in the background. Consider the flavor text:



> *Revealing the truth only deepened Tezzeret's curiosity for the secrets still buried.*
