*What's your most prized **Magic** possession?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** My most prized **Magic** possession is not an especially rare or noteworthy card. It's not signed, or foil, or 3-D, or even in especially good condition.

See, I'm an old-timer. In 1995, after playing **Magic** for the first time at a friend's house, I went out (and, um, begged my mom for some money) and bought two boosters and a "starter deck" of *Revised Edition*. Somewhere among those 90 cards lurked this gem:

I couldn't tell you for certain any of the other cards I got that day—well, except the [basics](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)—and I have no idea where any of them might be. Some of them are probably still in one of my card boxes, some I'm sure I traded off or gave away. But I know right where that [Shivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon) is, and I plan to keep it that way for a long, long time.
