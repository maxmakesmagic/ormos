The Five Most Interesting Multiplayer Cards in *Shadowmoor*

Shadowmoor is, as I've mentioned before, totally off the hook when it comes to multiplayer. You'll be seeing *Shadowmoor* cards hanging about the casual room for a *long* time thanks to great mechanics like persist and hybrid... and it's time to take a look at the most interesting multiplayer cards in *Shadowmoor*. 

Unfortunately, unlike the [previous article](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/morningtide-multiplayer-2008-02-05), this list is not a video. Between various bouts of flu, gratuitous injuries, scheduling conflicts, and lost weekends, I wasn't able to find the time to scrape together a video (which takes about ten to twelve hours to prepare). So instead, it's just gonna be plain ol' text—a bit disappointing, but there you have it.

On the plus side, you don't have to hear my whiny, high voice, which *is* a bonus. 

The cards I'm listing are not necessarily the most *powerful* (though I think they're close). The question of "power" in multiplayer is always heavily group-dependent—if you're playing in a group that never plays with [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), well, a card like [Twilight Shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Shepherd) becomes a lot less interesting. If you're in a group that plays only Vintage-style combo decks then a fun casual card like [Boon Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Reflection) is never going to be useful.

That said, I feel confident the five cards I list here are cards that can go into a variety of decks and be useful in a variety of environments. A card like, say, [Enchanted Evening](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enchanted+Evening) is a fine card... but you really have to jump through hoops to make it work for you. Yes, [Fracturing Gust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fracturing+Gust) will then destroy everything and gain you eleventy billion life, but then how do you *win*? Making a deck that utilizes [Enchanted Evening](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enchanted+Evening) effectively is a delightful challenge for you Johnnies out there, but it's not something you're going to play with outside of a deck specifically created to take advantage of it.

*These* cards are interesting because they can be plopped into a variety of decks. You should check to see whether you have any older decks that they might go into, because they're all solid cards.

![Reflecting Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reflecting+Pool)Also, a note: Some have complained lately about [Josh's initial pick](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/eat-your-vegetables-2008-05-20) of the new cycle of hybrid filter lands and [Reflecting Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflecting+Pool) as his Top Five (well, six) cards, claiming that getting a full set of rares is too difficult. Well, I'll stand by my statement that investing in a solid land base will get you far—like fellow casual writer [Chris Romeo](http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/archive.php?Article=Chris+Romeo), I believe that there are certain staple cards ([Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise)) that casual players *should* try to get a set of, because you can always find a home for them in almost any deck. The new lands qualify.That said, there's an attitude among certain players that you should never try to collect a play set of anything since it's anti-casual. These people say that you should just play with the cards you opened in your booster packs and buying seven boxes in an attempt to get a set of four [Oona, Queen of the Fae](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%2C+Queen+of+the+Fae) is too cutthroat.

That's a perfectly valid approach—heck, [I've helped my friend Dmitri out with that very problem](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/new-deck-smell-2006-12-05)! But I *do* think that in terms of discussing card-specific strategies it's nearly impossible to write about Constructed deckbuilding if the players are unwilling to go out and occasionally get a set of a good card or two.

Why? Because anyone's personal card pool is *so* player-dependent that it's impossible for me to tell you what kinds of decks you could build! I'm proud of that decklist I made with Dmitri, but that article only worked because I had Dmitri's cards in front of me. Given that I don't know what *you* have on-hand, it's hard for me to say what cards will work together best in *your* card pool.

(And just blindly swapping in three [Abbey Gargoyles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abbey+Gargoyles) in lieu of three [Twilight Shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Shepherd)s because they both fly and are white isn't going to work—good decks are about synergy and strategy, not randomly powerful cards tossed in like cherry tomatoes in a salad.)

In terms of looking at the best cards, I am actually completely rare-blind. I simply look over the booklet in the *Shadowmoor* fat pack and pick the ones that I think will be the most effective. Those cards tend to be *much* more effective when you have four of them.

(Though my top pick? I doubt I'd want more than two or three in a deck. Four's a bit too much.)

That said, just because I care and the list this time around *is* rare-heavy, I've also provided uncommon cards that are also noteworthy in terms of being good in multiplayer. Don't ever say I fail to provide alternatives. 

### Augury Adept#5: Augury Adept

[Augury Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Adept) was on my "interesting" list, bubbling up just underneath the Top Five, until I threw it in a deck designed to win any war of attrition. Every card was designed to leave dead cards in people's hands and to reuse the cards I had. 

Strangely enough, this deck went an amazing 4-1 in group games (which, as I'll remind you periodically, means that it came in as the winning deck in free-for-all matches against at least two other people—in one case, *five* other people). The single time it lost, it came in second... and *would* have won the next turn, were it not for an ugly 13-point [Hurricane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurricane) that took me out of the game. 

Admittedly, this is a deck that abuses our group's fondness for overpriced removal. A single [Tarfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarfire) can make things ugly for this deck—but we don't see [Tarfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarfire)s these days; rather we see [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate)s and more expensive stuff that gets you bang for your buck, and I planned the deck to take advantage of that. Take a look at this list:

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Drifting+Meadow)

















  
Thing is, you know what powers this deck? [Augury Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Adept). In a multiplayer game, there's a good chance that you can just randomly attack some slow-starting player with an Adept on turn four, getting you life *and* a card. Or, if that's not good enough for you, give your Adept protection with a [Mother of Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes) and send it past the gates. You'll often get 3 life and the card you needed.

You know what my group's come to hate? "[Griffin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide) my Adept, attack for four in the air. What's that? [Twilight Shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Shepherd)? Oh, six life, awesome!" 

I've gained thirteen life and six cards off this single little attacking critter. Yeah, as others have noted, you need to jump through hoops to get it to work... but if someone's wasting removal on a 2/2 of yours, so much the better when your big guns come out to play. And if not, you're drawing two cards a turn. 

You know what won me a notable game where I was going to die the next turn? 

"I attack with everything. [Mother of Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes), my two [Paladin *en*-Vec](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paladin+en-Vec)s, this Augury... Everything."

"No blocks. You can't kill me with what's on the board, and I hit for fatal damage the next turn."

"Okay, after no blocks are declared... [Mirrorweave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave) everything into an [Augury Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Adept). Oh, look, I just drew four cards and gained ten life, bringing me out of range!" 

![Mirrorweave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mirrorweave)I'm a big fan of the "small threat" attack in multiplayer. That's why [Taurean Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taurean+Mauler) was my #1 pick for *Morningtide*, and I *stand* by that pick. Oh, people will always want the big elbow-droppers like the [Corrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt)s [\*](#footnote1) and the [Din of the Fireherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Din+of+the+Fireherd)s and the Akromas... but something has to hold the fort until it arrives. Not everything can be a seven-mana spell! Why not have a three-mana spell that does something good?

*Yes*, [Augury Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Adept) is a 2/2. *Yes*, people can kill it. So what? If they waste removal on it then it's one less [Rend Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rend+Flesh) to aim at your Dragon when it comes to town. Considering that you're dealing with two colors that are good with granting evasion, it's a worthwhile check.

**The No-Rare Response**

Josh's #5 card was also white, and it's an uncommon that's uncommonly good: [Prison Term](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prison+Term). For three mana you have a reusable enchantment that stays on the board, neutralizing your opponent's biggest creature until an *even bigger* creature comes along (at which point you just quietly move it over). Whatever it is, you're pretty much guaranteed to hamstring the biggest threat on the board.

![Prison Term](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Prison+Term)The danger, of course, is that people won't like knowing that the best creature in their hand is going to land straight in jail upon arrival. Hence someone will almost certainly try to kill the enchanted creature in an attempt to get rid of the [Prison Term](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prison+Term), making a nice two-for-one—one opponent loses his or her biggest threat and you lose an enchantment.

### Everlasting Torment#4: Everlasting Torment

One of the big problems that multiplayer games face is an agonizing slowness. Why? Because everyone gives their creatures protection from everything, and everyone gains a zillion life, and blah blah blah *the pain*.

[Everlasting Torment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everlasting+Torment), for a mere three mana, shuts that *whole style* of play down. Not many cards do that—but for three mana, [Everlasting Torment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everlasting+Torment) reads, "Stop that annoying stuff you were doing and fight like a planeswalker."

Were you planning on gaining a million life off of that annoying [Essence Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden)? Uh-uh. Were you thinking you'd regenerate that blocker? Not so fast—it's studded through with these -1/-1 counters. Thinking you'd [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) this turn? Well, damage can't be prevented. Eat combat step, my friend!

Other cards have tried to do this in the past, most notably [Sulfuric Vortex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfuric+Vortex). But the Vortex irritated everyone at the table by also acting as a too-slow win condition, forcing people who otherwise benefited from your "no life gain" clause to attack you. [Everlasting Torment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everlasting+Torment), on the other hand, has no downside for those who aren't looking to gain life, prevent damage, or regenerate, allowing for some awesome short-term teamups. 

Yes, [Everlasting Torment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everlasting+Torment) is fighting the very colors that are best at [Disenchant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant)ing things—namely, green and white—but even one or two turns with an [Everlasting Torment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everlasting+Torment) in play can slow down that vexing Sliver deck with the [Essence Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden)s. And if they don't play with enchantment removal, they *will* regret it. 

Fun fact: Our group has the house rule that wither applies to players, too. So when you get hit with a 3/3 and [Everlasting Torment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everlasting+Torment) is in play, *you* now have three -1/-1 counters. They feel like shards of glass in your skin. Icky. You need a good shower to wash them off.

**The No-Rare Response**

You want a set of creatures that are actually very good? The Mentor cycle takes your army of threats and gives 'em usefulness. [Resplendent Mentor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Resplendent+Mentor) is arguably the best (well, except under an [Everlasting Torment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everlasting+Torment)), giving you a way of sitting back on defense and gaining life when you don't feel like sending the forces out to play.

But [Deepchannel Mentor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepchannel+Mentor) can turn your army of blue creatures into an alpha strike that will hamstring the unsuspecting opponent. And [Roughshod Mentor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roughshod+Mentor) will make all that green beef you have on the table smash right past the defenses of smaller creatures. [Bloodmark Mentor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodmark+Mentor) isn't particularly exciting until you realize that red's top-end creatures benefit considerably from being both Giantishly, Dragonly smashy, but now also first-strikey. 

The Mentors are vulnerable, of course—a single removal spell can turn a combat phase into a rout. This is why you should treat them like sorceries: play them when your relevant opponents are tapped out and/or helpless, then swarm in to remove those players from the game before they can recover. If you get another use out of them, which you often can, so much the better.

### Demigod of Revenge#3: Demigod of Revenge

As I've noted time and time again, the best multiplayer decks can recycle their best cards. [Demigod of Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) comes with a built-in recycling clause. 

Let someone [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). In the late game, that topdeck pluck of a [Demigod of Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) might uplift an additional two of its fallen brethren straight out from the graveyard, dealing *15 points* of damage across a clear blue sky. The longer the game goes on, the more it favors you. 

Sadly, the Demigod's tricky—you have to *play* it. Simply [Zombify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify)ing the 5/4 won't resurrect the other copies from six feet under. But on the plus side, merely playing it is enough to trigger its ability—even if your Evil Blue Mage decides to counter the Demigod, the "returns to play" trigger will still happen (which is especially nice if said EBM doesn't realize that).

Plus, "haste" is one of those perennially undervalued multiplayer mechanics. Haste means that if someone thought it was safe to attack you with everything because you don't have any defenders, they're going to pay for it. And a card like [Demigod of Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) can make that a very, *very* painful mistake.

That's just assuming you do nothing tricky! A second-turn [Rakdos Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Signet), third-turn [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive), fourth-turn [Demigod of Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) can make for an ugly quasi-combo deck that gives you a whopping big army earlier than many decks can handle. And since you're in black, the color of bringing creatures back to your hand, finding ways to get those things to trigger shouldn't be difficult at all.

The Demigod is a blunt-force instrument without a lot of subtlety. But that doesn't mean it's not painfully good.

**The No-Rare Response**

Green has traditionally had problems handling flying creatures at instant speed. Things like [Squall Line](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squall+Line) help, but realistically speaking it's hard to justify doing 6 damage to yourself just to avoid a Dragon. And eight mana is a *lot*. Other things, like Spiders and [Cloudthresher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher)s and so forth, are fine, but they tend to be a) expensive, and b) bounced or killed at the most inappropriate times.

![Gloomwidow's Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gloomwidow%27s+Feast)No, what green mages need is some targeted removal that they can hold back until the instant that big bewinged thing turns in *their* direction. Thankfully, we now have [Gloomwidow's Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gloomwidow%27s+Feast)—a valuable tool in green's arsenal, making it a little trickier in combat.

I know I'll be using [Gloomwidow's Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gloomwidow%27s+Feast) in my green decks aimed at the long game. It helps.

### Sygg, River Cutthroat#2: Sygg, River Cutthroat

I've talked about how good Sygg is in a [past article](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/plays-you-remember-2008-05-13), but I don't think I've given you numbers. I've played Sygg in three games, and I kept track of how many additional cards I drew off of his ability. 

You know what the average number of cards he drew me was? 

*Five*. 

That's right; in three games, Sygg's delightful triggered ability gave me five cards on average (well, to be precise, 4.6666 cards, but still...).

Because Sygg is so wonderfully low-cost, coming out on turn two, unless your opponent has the [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) right then—and is willing to use it—you're likely to pick up two or three cards in the early skirmishes until they finally dispatch your Sygg.

If they attack you? Don't block. Just attack back with some 2-power chump and a Sygg, get your 3 damage in, and draw the card yourself.

And in the late game, when you draw another Sygg, because the damage is now flowing and people are far more concerned about that gigantic [Oona, Queen of the Fae](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%2C+Queen+of+the+Fae) here and that [Midnight Banshee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Banshee) there and look, there's a [Reaper King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+King)! Well, Sygg once again falls below the radar, allowing you a couple of freebies.

*Someone's* going to be taking damage. And Sygg isn't a threat *now*. He just makes threats possible *later*, giving your opponents the ugly choice of removing Sygg and leaving the actual threat still on the board, or letting you draw cards into an ultimate real threat. Plus, weaker players tend to underestimate or forget about Sygg, leaving him alone! Bonus.

If there was a two-card spell that says, "You draw four extra cards over the course of the game," [\*\*](#footnote2) you'd play it. You'd especially play it if it could serve as a chump blocker. Now get out there and Sygg it up, because that's exactly what this little Rogue guy is. 

**The No-Rare Response**

For two mana, [Inkfathom Witch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkfathom+Witch) can wreak a surprising amount of havoc. Yes, its ability costs four mana, a lot to reserve when you'd rather be playing spells, but it allows you to interfere in anyone's combat in *very* ugly ways. 

![Inkfathom Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Inkfathom+Witch)The obvious method is that if someone is attacking someone else, and they choose not to block that horde of 1/1 Saproling tokens, you can make it a rather punishing decision. Now they're... well, given that it's probably 12 damage and up now, they're probably dead. (This can work even better if it's your horde of Saproling tokens, but then they'll probably see it coming and act accordingly. You'd be surprised how often you can pants an opponent who's not paying sufficient attention.)

But even better, [Inkfathom Witch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkfathom+Witch) turns every -1/-1 counter—and you do have them nowadays, no?—into certain death. You choose not to block, their creatures are now 4/1s with -1/-1 counters, they die as a state-based effect. Simple.

Any pinger can now dispose of these unblocked creatures—[Prodigal Sorcerer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Sorcerer) FTW! And let us not forget the evil favorite artifact of mine that is [Caltrops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caltrops). Sure, you can attack me but if you do, your creatures already have a single damage on them. If I don't block and then activate this, well, it's a one-sided annihilation...

The downside is that the Witch is a 1/1 and easily disposed of. Still, the amount of impact it can have upon a game is vastly disproportionate to its cost.

### Cauldron of Souls#1: Cauldron of Souls

The fascinating thing about [Cauldron of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cauldron+of+Souls) is that for a mere five mana, it protects everything else you own, giving your cards double-duty. It can go in almost any non-weenie deck, protecting your bold Giants or your large Treefolk—or heck, even your mid-sized Rebels or Snakes! And once you have it out it protects *everything*, since you can choose as many creatures as... well, as you control.

[Twilight Shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Shepherd) almost nudged this out, since it can bring all your stuff back, not just creatures...but you still have to play everything again. With the [Cauldron of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cauldron+of+Souls), you merely tap it and every creature it targets that dies comes back with a -1/-1 counter.

Plus, there's the extra-special bonus round to be had in that [Cauldron of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cauldron+of+Souls) can be used to your advantage. Is there some creature you think is keeping your opponent in check? Well, heck, bring *that* on back. Have a teammate in a Two-Headed Giant game who could use some love? The Cauldron helps 'em all.

With a Cauldron out, your opponents are going to have to deal with your armies twice. That gets ugly if you have creatures with comes-into-play effects. Want that [Bladewing the Risen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladewing+the+Risen) to serve double duty? Don't mind if it does! [Angel of Despair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair) again? Sure enough! Cards like [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders) get a little nicer, [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch)s become life-gain engines of doom, evoke creatures suddenly come back into play once you target them in mid-evoke with persist, Harbingers get you all sorts of goodies, and [Marsh Flitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter)s...

...okay, it doesn't work with [Marsh Flitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter). But I *want* it to.

[Cauldron of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cauldron+of+Souls) is the kind of card I like to see in multiplayer—powerful, (ab)usable by any number of decks, and well-costed (I'd like it even better at four mana, but hey—Wizards ain't *crazy*). It's something to keep in mind when you've got a deck that wins via mid-sized to large creatures, since a one-time investment of five mana can pay off repeatedly.

**The No-Rare Response**

One hesitates to bring them up because, well, everyone already knows about them but really, if you're looking for good uncommons, [Beseech the Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beseech+the+Queen) and [Flame Javelin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin) are at the top of the line. They both do a lot better in mono-colored decks. [Beseech the Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beseech+the+Queen) is comparatively cheap tutoring for those who can't afford [Demonic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Demonic%2BTutor) and/or [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor)s and [Flame Javelin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin) is the sort of answer that often cuts someone off in mid-question. As I've said before, removing a player from the game is a great response to all *sorts* of problems.

Many others have discussed how great these cards are. It's no surprise that they're at the top, because they dang well *should* be.

So what did Josh pick? I'll discuss that later. His choices varied a bit from mine, and it's worth looking at what he thinks are good cards. Since I'm sure I'll hear the usual wonderings of why a given card didn't make the list, I'll also tell you why Your Favorite Card From *Shadowmoor* didn't quite crack the Top Five. 

[\*](#footnote1back) – Reprinted in *Shadowmoor*. It's a darned good card. Get some, if you didn't before.

[\*\*](#footnote2back) – I'll round down. I have no fear.
