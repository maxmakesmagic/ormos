![Guildpact style guide image](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1043_cathedral.jpg)A politically-charged compromise between White's devotion to community order and Black's thirst for individual power, the Orzhov Syndicate is a guild entirely committed to the establishment and maintainance of a power structure in Ravnica.

 Today we take a look at the *Guildpact* style guide to see how the look and feel of the Orzhov illustrates this commitment as well as some other interesting details about them. 

A *style guide* is a document of text and reference illustrations used to guide artists who work on a **Magic** set. Unless otherwise noted, the concept illustrations shown in this Arcana are all by *Guildpact's* lead conceptual artist, D. Alexander Gregory.

One of the most important aspects of the Orzhov is their ruling elite, the ghost council. Before they were a [Ghost Council of Orzhova](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ghost%2BCouncil%2Bof%2BOrzhova), they were concepted as a necromancy-supported patriarchy of mostly-undead guild bosses, sort of a cross between archbishops and mafia dons. See [Revenant Patriarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revenant+Patriarch), [Castigate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castigate), [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) and of course [Ghost Council of Orzhova](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Council+of+Orzhova) for cards with looks at who's running the show of the guild.

Under the patriarchs are layer after layer of lesser figures such as bishops, pontiffs, and [enforcers](/en/articles/archive/orzhov-soldier-2006-03-23). Key to the Orzhov gameplan is the use of a veneer of religion to cover up -- and provide moral justification for -- their power-mongering, criminal dealings. The pontiff concept (below, left) was a direct inspiration for the [Orzhov Pontiff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orzhov+Pontiff) card, and you can see the idea of masks (again, another example of deception and the hiding of true purposes -- or is it just an expression of pious shame?) show up on [Agent of Masks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Masks).

As for their lowest-level minions, the Orzhov employ both gargoyles -- which decorate their overblown guildhalls that serve as part cathedral and part bank -- and thrulls, which we've [seen in Arcana before](/en/articles/archive/return-thrulls-2006-02-09).
