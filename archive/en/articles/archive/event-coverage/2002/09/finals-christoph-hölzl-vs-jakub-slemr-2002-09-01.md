Christophe has won every match he has played so far, and if he wins this he’ll beat the record held by Jon Finkel for number of wins in a GP. Jon went 13-0 in GP Boston a few years ago before winning the event, but there is an extra round here this weekend. Jakub Slemr is hoping to stop him, though, and unlike Hölzl, he has plenty of experience at this level.

### Game One

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/872.jpg)Jakub went first but he didn’t have a good draw by any means, and his first play was a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), although he just discarded a couple of lands. He then made a [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) which was Edicted. Jakub played a [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) and a [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), but they both died to a [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate).

The Czech played a [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder), which was also Edicted, and then another Mongrel. Hölzl wasn’t worried as he had [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade), and [Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes) which removed a very decent portion of Jakub’s deck from the game. Undaunted Slemr used his Mongrel to put a Rootwalla and a [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) token into play. They were [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate)d. The German then cast another [Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes), which left Jakub with only a very small amount of ways to win left in his deck.

Christoph Tutored for a [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) and won the game in two attacks as unsurprisingly, Jakub drew nothing but land.

### Game Two

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/871.jpg)Jakub summoned a turn two [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) which was Edicted, and then a third turn [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear), which met the same fate. After [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop)ing an attempted [Rancid Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth) by Christoph, he played a [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest) and followed it up with a [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill).

Hölzl had another [Rancid Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth), though, so only one Squirrel was produced. Jakub was on the offensive as he cast a pair of [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla)s and a [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). The German attempted to [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate) but it was [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop)ed. Jakub’s next attack brought Christoph to seven, and since he didn’t have a [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate) it was on to game three.

### Game Three

The Czech player had a poor hand in game three. When he cast [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) on the first turn he discarded two Careful Studies. He then waited an extra turn before casting his [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), presumably so he had [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop) back up, although he didn’t use it when Christoph cast [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood). This was so that he could play [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest) with [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop) back up on his fourth turn.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/873.jpg)Hölzl played [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) and passed the turn. It looked as though he was in serious trouble when Jakub made a [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) and a [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill). Hölzl cast [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate), but it wasn’t important enough to bother [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop)ing. Slemr made a second [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) and when Christoph attempted [Rancid Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth), that was [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop)ed.

Hölzl played another [Rancid Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth) but again it was [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop)ed. Then he cast a [Grotesque Hybrid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grotesque+Hybrid) but since Slemr already had three Squirrels in play, that wasn’t important either. When Jakub played a [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) they had to trade, but now Slemr had four squirrels in play. Slemr added a second [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest), so now even the threshold on the [Rancid Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth) didn’t matter, and Christop had to admit defeat.
