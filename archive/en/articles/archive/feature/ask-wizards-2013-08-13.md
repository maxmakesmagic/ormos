Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks!


Mark Rosewater's [article from yesterday](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/260) sure seems to have gone over well! It's generated a lot of questions on his [Tumblr](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com), so let's grab some and share them here!


—Mike McArtor, copyeditor of DailyMTG.com


 **Q: More *Unglued 2* cuts, please! I thought you weren't allowed to share them with us... If I had known, I would have asked a long time ago. If possible, could we see the art and names for all the cycles you mentioned (the die rolling, the poison-lands, etc.)? —dunharrow-le-dingue**  


**A: Mark Rosewater**


If this article is popular, I'm willing to do more. There's lots more to show.


*[Apparently it was. To another question later, Mark said the following.—Ed.]*


The good news is this article's going over well so an "Un-seen 2" article is likely to happen.


 **Q: This isn't a question but I really like this sentence on Poodleboy: "If you lose the flip, you're stuck with Poodleboy." —abadusername**  


**A: Mark Rosewater**


As I stated in the article, editing had not gotten their hands on the file, but I was trying to add some attitude in the templating and reminder text.


 **Q: Is posting an article about an old un-set on the Mothership a subtle way of reinstating fervor for an un-set? :) —soacoti**  


**A: Mark Rosewater**


Honestly it came about because [I did] a [podcast on *Unglued 2*](http://media.wizards.com/podcasts/magic/drivetowork38unglued2.mp3)  and I realized it was a crime so much awesome art has never been seen.


This is the first time, by the way, that a podcast spurred an article and not the other way around.
