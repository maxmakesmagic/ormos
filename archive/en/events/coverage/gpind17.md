Day 2 Coverage



The final day of *Hour of Devastation* Limited is underway. Across the ocean at Metz, they are hosting the European equivalent—a dual-chorus coda to a wonderful era in *Magic* Limited. Talking to everyone in the room, there was nothing but joy expressed for the format, and today will be a fond farewell.


But a farewell with a big trophy attached!


Right now, players are putting the finishing touches on their first decks, and are readying their weapons to fire. And almost every players’ sights are set on the same targets—the 9-0 players. Massdrop West’s Scott Lipp, Puzzle Quest’s Andrew Cuneo, Mark Ruby, Aaron Lewis, and Andrew Funkhouser all are without a match loss—and Funkhouser without a *game* loss!


*Hour of Devastation* is one for the record books—and one player will have their name etched at the bottom of the ledger, marking their place in *Magic* history.

 




Day 1 Coverage



It’s a bittersweet day for many in Indiana. Though the Grand Prix has been fantastic—full of punches from haymakers to jabs—today signaled the last day of Hour of Devastation Sealed Grand Prix. These nine rounds put it out for the count. One of the most fun Sealed formats in a long time, Hour of Devastation fulfilled all our wildest dreams for the second set of the *Amonkhet* block.


But don’t pick up the tissues just yet! Tomorrow starts the Draft portion, and at least five players will be thinking about that fact late into tonight. Scott Lipp, Andrew Cuneo, Mark Ruby, Aaron Lewis, and Andrew Funkhouser lead the pack at 9-0. Tomorrow it will be their fight to lose.


With three packs their weapons, they'll enter the ring against myriad opponents and try to outlast them all. The brawls will surely be devastating, and not to be missed.


We'll see you all tomorrow at [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic), bright and early at 9 am. See you then!
