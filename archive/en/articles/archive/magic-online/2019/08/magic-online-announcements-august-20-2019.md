More Limited MCQ Preliminaries
------------------------------


We're now offering 14 Limited MCQ Preliminary events per week—that's 5 additional events! Starting this week, the new events take place Friday at 2 a.m., 11 a.m., 4 p.m., and 7 p.m., and Sunday at 1 p.m.


For more information on Preliminaries, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-mythic-championship-qualifiers#DOM_schedule).

Premier Event Calendar Updated Through October
----------------------------------------------


The [MTGO event calendar](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/schedule-magic-online-products-game-info), [MOCS info page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2019-magic-online-championship-series), and [MCQ info page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-mythic-championship-qualifiers) have all been updated to include qualifiers for 2020's Players Tour (formerly named Mythic Championship in 2019) through October. Fierce combat and countless spoils await players who battle it out for a chance to compete alongside the best in 2020!




---

Banned & Restricted List Update Window
--------------------------------------


Next week, at 8 a.m. PT on Monday, August 26, R&D will make an announcement regarding the banned and restricted lists for each format. If there is a change to any format, *Magic Online* will implement that change at 12 p.m. PT on the same day as the announcement.


If a card is banned or restricted, players using the newly banned card in a league can finish their league courses in the intervening four hours. At noon, however, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned or unrestricted, players can join existing leagues with decks containing those cards after the update.




---

You Choose the Flashback
------------------------


Outlasting all the competition, *Khans of Tarkir* won the first You Choose the Flashback contest on Twitter. This has earned it a week of Flashback time, beginning August 21. Players can enter these Phantom drafts of three Khans of Tarkir boosters using either 10 event tickets, 2 Khans boosters and 2 event tickets, or 100 Play Points.


Additionally, Vintage Masters, the other finalist, performed so well that we will also be running a Flashback week of that format. We haven't announced the schedule for events post-Throne of Eldraine yet, but this VMA Flashback week will probably happen in November.

Next Spotlight Cube: *Grixis Cube*
----------------------------------


We know a lot of you really enjoyed the last Spotlight Cube. The next one, launching a week from tomorrow, is a doozy, too. Ryan Overturf ([@RyanOverdrive](https://twitter.com/RyanOverdrive) on Twitter) has a real treat for us: the *Grixis Cube*. Starting August 28, you can pretend that green and white don't exist and draft a Cube with deep archetypes and deeper dives into the three (and a half) supported colors! Click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/cube-spotlight-series-grixis-cube-2019-08-13) for a full design article talking about the Cube and the details of its awesomeness.

*Commander 2019* in Treasure Chests
-----------------------------------


You can now find *Commander 2019* cards in your Treasure Chests. The [Treasure Chest page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info) has all the details, but the quick version: 30% of chests will have a random C19 card, weighted by rarity. Four cards won't be available yet, though: Empowered Autogenerator; Elsha of the Infinite; Rayami, First of the Fallen; and Tahngarth, First Mate. These four cards will be released later, though, after we've fixed some remaining bugs on them.
