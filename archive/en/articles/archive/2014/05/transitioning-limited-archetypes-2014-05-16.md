For nearly every block format, Limited archetypes often beget constructed ones. *Odyssey* block Limited made sure we don't miss madness, and it took hold in Block Constructed and Standard. Ravnica block Limited pointed out the power of populate, and Craig Wescoe won a Pro Tour propagating tokens. And so on and so on.



And it makes sense. R&D builds a Limited format as a stable environment full of cross-set synergies and ways to amplify block mechanics, all of which are ratcheted up when it comes to Block Constructed, the one Constructed format that perfectly matches the pool of cards available for Limited.



 While word on the street is that *Theros* Block Constructed has less Limited crossover appeal than previous blocks, there is no doubt that many of this weekend's strategies are rising from the ranks of Limited.






*The White-Blue Heroic strategies in Limited set the standard for what the archetype looks like in Block Constructed.*
