The May 1, 2017 Update
======================

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on May 1, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter). Because I can. Also, because [it's up for a vote this week in the *Magic* Bracket](#9). Don't let me down, internet! Don't let me down!


Also, please note that we have extended maintenance on the website tomorrow, which means there will be no Daily Update for May 2 and it also means our regular content will publish a touch earlier than normal. I'll tweet out some stuff I find cool, fun, or interesting, but you won't have the opportunity to read my words. I know. I feel sorry for you, too.


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [StarCityGames.com Atlanta Open Weekend](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/290417_atlanta.html)

Mardu won the weekend, but the [Top 64 decks](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=1&start_date=04/29/2017&end_date=04/29/2017&start=1&finish=64&event_ID=19&city=Atlanta&state=GA&country=US&start_num=0) revealed quite a bit of possibility. You can watch some of those new decks by checking out the replays of [Day One](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/139002650) and [Day Two](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/139119038).


1. [We Need the Needle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inA5z8jwWXY) | TheMagicManSam

TheMagicManSam knocks it out of the park with another video in order to make a simple plea—he wants [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) in Standard again. Sorry, Sam, awesome videos aren't enough to sway R&D. You need road signs or pizza.


(I'm kidding. Please don't send us anything with [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) written on it.)

1. [In Response: Bans, MTG Product Overload, and GP Exclusivity—A *Magic: The Gathering* Debate Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_B4kPgYRYE) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor and Josh Lee Kwai,

In Response returned this weekend with special guests Graham Stark and Nate Holt, where they debated all the things sports-show style.


Of note, as The Professor points out at the beginning, they filmed in the awkward (sorry!) spot between Monday's B&R announcement and Wednesday's addendum, so their debate was colored by the timing.

After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Magic Online* Standard PTQ Decklists](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-ptq-2017-04-30)

Hungry for new Standard decklists? The Top 32 lists from the *Magic Online* Standard PTQ have been posted, and Mardu is certainly not the only game in this particular town. My favorites are the Improvise deck in 5th place and the White-Blue Control list in 7th Place. I have no idea how that white-blue deck ever finished a match in time, but however it did so, it looks sweet.


1. [Video: Black-Red Madness in Standard!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35029_Video-RB-Madness-In-Standard.html) | StarCityGames.com | Gerry Thompson

Madness and the new "heckbent" ability (things that matter when you have one or fewer cards in hand) go pretty well together. There *has* to be something there. Right? Gerry Thompson explores.


1. [*Amonkhet* Constructed Set Review: Red](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/amonkhet-constructed-set-review-red/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

If you read the Daily Update but don't read LSV's set reviews, there's probably not much I can say. If you do and you do, well, then soldier on. Red's on the menu today, and it's packed full of power (which this weekend confirmed).


1. [The Role of *Magic Online* in the Banning of Felidar Guardian](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/05/role-magic-online-banning-felidar-guardian/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Rich Stein

All right, one last bit of commentary on last week's B&R announcement, as this one was a touch different in that it focused on the implications of data mining *Magic Online* and less on the action itself. Plus, Stein did his research, finding a common thread with a bit of news from 2015, looking deep into our data psyches. Which we totally have.


What People Are Talking About

It's certainly not wrong to draw some conclusions from this weekend (hey, Mardu is still really good), but this week was a little bit . . . volatile. Really, not many people were making the case that Mardu was still unbeatable—most comments [were just like this](https://twitter.com/TheManaSource/status/859031642186403840), waiting for analysis of [a weekend that defies analysis](https://twitter.com/SaffronOlive/status/859040658148950018).

I don't bring up the *Magic* Bracket often because it's a long-term project pitting every *Magic* card ever printed against another, head-to-head style, until a winner is chosen (I'd be shocked if the eventually winner wasn't [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) or [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall), but it's the internet, so it'll probably be [Storm Crow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Crow) or [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) or some other such nonsense). I check in now and then, and this one just so happens to include [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), possibly (definitely) the best creature ever printed. [Cloudblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer) is a close second, but, thankfully, those two are not up against one another this week.


This is also a good way to *really* improve your Mental *Magic* and/or *Magic* trivia skills. I mean, prior to today I don't think I could have told you the text on [Venarian Gold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venarian+Gold). Now I'm an expert! Useful!


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Zac Caudillo's White-Black Zombies](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=113184)

Yes, Mardu won the StarCityGames.com Open, but that's not terribly surprising given that the deck already existed in basically its best form prior to the [Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian) banning this week and Friday's release of *Amonkhet*. But several cool decks also showed up, giving a glimpse of what's possible in the format.


One of the best-looking ones on the stream was a White-Black Zombies deck played by Zac Caudillo, who ended up finishing 14th with the combination of *Shadows over Innistrad* and *Amonkhet* Zombies. Turns out, Zombies of any plane still work well together.


The new additions are [Dread Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Wanderer), [Lord of the Accursed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Accursed), [Plague Belcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Belcher), and [Wayward Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayward+Servant)—which also happens to be the only white card in the main deck.


The deck certainly looks promising, as it's both fast and capable of grinding. Several players commented on how impressed they were with the deck while on stream. Whether that translates into Pro Tour success is something we'll see in about two weeks at [Pro Tour *Amonkhet*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptakh).
