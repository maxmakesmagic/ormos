Legion Events is proud to host the first Grand Prix of the year for the second year in a row. Despite the conventional wisdom that Denver in January will be covered in snow, the weather this time of year is very fair and clear. The venue has a free shuttle from the airport, and the venue is the same as the player hotel. Parking is free for those of you driving and food is plentiful around the venue!


 The first 700 players registering will get a great **Magic** art playmat *(picture not yet available)*. 




 *The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).

 Players must have a signed publicity release form to be included in Wizards of the Coast's official online event coverage.

Minors must have a parent or guardian’s signature on this form. Publicity releases will be collected during registration. 



**Tournament Format**
  


* The Head Judges for Grand Prix Bilbao are Frank Wareman and Jurgen Baert. Judges interested in working at this event should submit an application through the **Magic** judge website ([apps.magicjudges.org](http://apps.magicjudges.org)).
* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day 2 that they used on Day 1.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
