*Theros* Block Intro Packs Leaving the Store October 8
Intro Packs for all of *Theros* Block, *Theros*, *Born of the Gods*, and *Journey into Nyx*, will be leaving the *Magic Online* store on Wednesday, October 8. If you haven't added these to your collection yet, don't forget to do so before they're gone for good!





Extended Downtime on September 24
There will be an extended downtime on Wednesday, September 24, for *Magic Online*. Events close at 12:00 a.m. Pacific (07:00 UTC), midnight, and store activity and trades end at 2:45 a.m. Pacific (09:45 UTC) leading up to the system coming down at 3:00 a.m. Pacific (10:00 UTC).


Please plan ahead!





Downtime for September 17, 2014

* All tournaments will close at 5:00 a.m. Pacific (12:00 UTC)
* Store and trade activity will be suspended at approximately 7:45 a.m. Pacific (14:45 UTC)
* The system will be down from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Pacific (15:00 to 19:00 UTC)


**Collection and Trade**



* Fixed: Occasional crash when trying to add cards to a new binder that is not the active binder
* Fixed: Crash in Trade when dragging and dropping cards to the “Will Receive” area
* Fixed: Issue that could prevent context menu from adding items to a deck or trade binder after previously adding or removing items to a deck or binder
* Added: New warning icon for decks that contain versions of cards that are different than those in a player's collection
* Fixed: While "Show Versions Separately" is selected, double clicking a pile to add cards to a deck or binder will only add the selected version
* Fixed: When adding cards to a deck or binder, the correct version is added when "Show Versions Separately" is not selected
* Fixed: Issue that caused incorrect quantity of items to show in collection and binder after using the "Add All to Open Binder" context menu selection while versions of the selected item were already in the binder


**Duel Scene and Play Lobby**



* Updated: Adjusted default sizes and locations for several Duel Scene elements, including: starting hand size, minimum hand size, sizes of cards in temporary windows and on the battlefield, and "Red Zone" size
* Fixed: If an opponent has revealed his or her hand, and then concedes, the revealed cards no longer persist for the next game
* Added: “Clear deck selection” button in Play
* Fixed: Event Details window updates game records as matches are completed. Standings will not be updated until the end of the round.
* Added: Players can now use text search during limited deck building


**Card Issues**



* Fixed: Creature enchanted by Oppressive Rays can no longer block other creatures while Noble Quarry is attacking
* Fixed: You can no longer pay off-color mana for costs that require a specific color payment. Previously, that mana was consumed, not refundable and provided no benefit.
