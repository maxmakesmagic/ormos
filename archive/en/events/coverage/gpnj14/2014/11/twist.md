 Since the release of *Khans of Tarkir*, Legacy has been taken over by powerful Delve cards like [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). As these cards have been establishing footing atop the metagame, players have adopted new and old strategies with exciting twists in an effort to overcome these powerful draw engines. Let's take a moment to discuss some of the big changes we're seeing in established archetypes.




 Maverick, a traditionally base Green/White creature deck with a lot of interaction, has been a popular choice for players looking to punish their Blue/Red Delver opponents. [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) is usually big enough to overcome any burn spells from the Blue/Red decks. [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) kills the format's most important threats repeatedly thanks to its interaction with [Grove of the Burnwillows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows). One of the most exciting innovations we've seen in some the Maverick lists this weekend is the inclusion of [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) and Thespian's Stage. Using [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary), the pilot can search for Thespian's Stage on the opponent's endstep, and search for [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) the following turn for an instant-speed 20/20 Merit Lage token. This interaction becomes especially powerful when one considers that [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes) is present to protect all stages of the combo. Additionally, [Scryb Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger) can be used to activate [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) twice on the same turn, surprising the opponent with a unforeseeable Merit Lage!

 Miracles has been widely considered one of the most powerful strategies in Legacy for the better part of the last year. [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) and Sensei's Divining Top combine to severely limit the range of spells most opponent's can resolve in a format where the majority of cards cost one or two mana. One of the biggest innovations we've seen in the Miracles deck is the inclusion of the [Helm of Obedience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Obedience)/[Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace) combo. With many of the tempo strategies playing less countermagic than normal, including a powerful combo in the deck gives it a way to ensure victory before the longevity of the decks with a lot of burn and [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) close the game through attrition.

 With so much Blue/Red Delver, many of the decks have begun cutting countermagic in favor of inexpensive removal. As a result, we've begun seeing a lot of combo strategies have quite a bit of success. [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) decks seem to be the true combo strategy of choice, but there are plenty of Elves, Storm, and other combo strategies showing up in force this weekend to take advantage of a field that's relatively soft to them.

 Sneak and Show variants of [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) are adopting [Overmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overmaster) as a powerful new tool to force through their combo. [Overmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overmaster) is very strong for a number of reasons in the current Legacy format. There's a lot less discard in the new Legacy metagame because of how poorly those types of cards matchup against [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise). [Overmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overmaster) fights countermagic better than any other card, and, with no discard in the format, that's of extremely high priority for a pure combo deck. Additionally, [Overmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overmaster) cannot be countered by [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast), which has become a maindeck inclusion for many of the Blue/Red and Jeskai colored strategies.
