![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a913.jpg)This match-up sees two control decks facing off. Marco has a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) deck and Sam has the [Awakening](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening) deck which was used by some members of Team Punisher at the Pro Tour in Houston. It's an incredibly favorable match for the German.

### Game 1

Marco went first with a third turn [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), which Sam was unable to counter. Marco just swung for one for a couple of turns, while the English player used two [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge)s and an [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) to look for answers.

Gomersall played a [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) which was [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed by Marco. Sam paid the mana but this left him with just a blue mana open. Marco had two Accumulates of his own, which drew him a total of seven cards. This was more than enough to make the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) lethal that turn.

Marco Blume 1 – Sam Gomersall 

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a915.jpg)Sam had to take a mulligan going first, and stalled on two lands for a turn. Although he then managed to [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) for [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge), Blume had a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). Meanwhile the German was applying the one point beatdown with a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog).

Marco played his own Accumulate for four, then [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ed for three more. The Englishman had to [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) for [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) in the hope that Marco didn't have a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), but unsurprisingly the German's fifteen card hand did have one.

**Final Result:** Marco Blume 2 – Sam Gomersall 0
