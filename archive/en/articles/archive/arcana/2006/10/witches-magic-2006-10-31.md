The witch is a popular icon of Halloween that also has a place in the **Magic** multiverse. The term “witch” refers to a person who practices black magic, which has obvious usefulness in a game about spell-hurlers that has the color black as part of its identity. However, **Magic** strives to stay away from gender-specific terms in card names, or to use what are usually gender-specific terms for both genders. There are counterexamples, but in most cases, these are exceptions that prove the rule. Most of the time, a nonlegendary creature’s name does not imply whether the creature is male or female. [Llanowar Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Llanowar%2BKnight) and [Vulshok Sorcerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Vulshok%2BSorcerer) and [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Viridian%2BShaman) in **Magic** can all be men or women.


The same is true of witches. To an English speaker, “witch” usually implies a *female* practitioner of the dark arts, but in **Magic** it’s a gender-neutral term. The art of various creatures named “witch” shows this is the case:




  


Note also that the term “warlock,” generally considered to be the male counterpart to “witch,” does not appear in **Magic**. So what’s the word for a male witch? “Witch”!


Happy Halloween!
