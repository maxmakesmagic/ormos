By Wizards of the Coast











![Question Elemental?](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Question+Elemental%3F)**[Question Elemental?](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Question+Elemental%3F)** – *Unhinged* uncommon. The original version of [Question Elemental?](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Question+Elemental%3F) was in the never-published *Unglued II*, where it was called "Jeopardy" after the popular US game show. The art, which showed members of the Weatherlight crew playing the game, can be seen [here](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/mm/mm48_jeopardy.jpg).
 ![Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Careful+Study)**[Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study)** – *Odyssey* common. The mechanic of "drawing cards" has been depicted many different ways on **Magic** cards, going back to [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall)'s somewhat abstract representation of "remembering what your ancestors knew." The most common version, seen on [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), is that drawing cards represents knowledge.
 ![Gruesome Discovery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gruesome+Discovery)**[Gruesome Discovery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruesome+Discovery)** – *Dark Ascension* common. The scene portrayed in the art for [Gruesome Discovery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruesome+Discovery) is a Innistrad nobleman, whose wife has just found his corpse. The artist has chosen not to depict the horrific violence directly, instead allowing the wife's reaction to convey the horror she feels.
 ![Trenching Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Trenching+Steed)**[Trenching Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trenching+Steed)** – *Prophecy* common. [Trenching Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trenching+Steed) is what you get when a farm horse, used for plowing trenches in fields, is put to work fighting the oppressor and jumping trenches of men. This week's Card of the Day theme is "Oscar-nominated movies" and that seems perfectly fitting for Spielberg’s *War Horse*.
 ![Descendant of Kiyomaro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Descendant+of+Kiyomaro)**[Descendant of Kiyomaro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descendant+of+Kiyomaro)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* uncommon. The "maro" creatures of *Saviors of Kamigawa* all have related cards, but only [Kiyomaro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiyomaro), [Masumaro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masumaro), and [Soramaro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soramaro) have [descendants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?name=+%5Bdescendant%5D). [Kagemaro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kagemaro) has a [clutch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=clutch) and [Adamaro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adamaro) has a gaze. Because they're an aura and an instant, they couldn't be named "Descendant of" the related legends. 
 ![Crystal Ball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crystal+Ball)**[Crystal Ball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystal+Ball)** – ***Magic** 2011* common. Once core sets started having new cards in them, R&D was able to use the opportunity to present simple and clean implementation of mechanics. And when scry was added to ***Magic** 2011*, that let [Crystal Ball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystal+Ball) present a very flavorful version of it.
 ![Goblin Mime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Mime)**[Goblin Mime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Mime)** – *Unhinged* common. [Goblin Mime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Mime) was one of five *Unhinged* cards that had alternate-art promo versions. You can see the other version of the art [here](/en/articles/archive/hidden-unhinged-jokes-2008-02-11), along with the other four cards.
 ![Jangling Automaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jangling+Automaton)**[Jangling Automaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jangling+Automaton)** – *Weatherlight* common. [Jangling Automaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jangling+Automaton) is a card that basically exists to dare deckbuilders to find a way to use it. Anthony Alongi accepted this challenge and his readers found ideas past [Lure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) and [Tolarian Entrancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Entrancer). He tells the story [here](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/breaking-cards-again-2002-11-12).
 ![Last Stand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=LAST+STAND)**[Last Stand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Stand)** – *Apocalypse* rare. There are only two cards in the history of **Magic** that have all five mana symbols and mention all five basic land types. One is [Last Stand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Stand). To see the other, click here.
 [Naked Singularity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naked+Singularity)!


![Weirding Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Weirding+Shaman)**[Weirding Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weirding+Shaman)** – *Morningtide* rare. As the flavor text on [Weirding Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weirding+Shaman) implies, the goblins on Lorwyn are organized into tribes each ruled by an auntie (like [Mad Auntie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Auntie) or [Wort, Boggart Auntie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wort%2C+Boggart+Auntie)). Since the aunties are all shamans, this means that the male goblins are all magicians' nephews. The female ones are magicians' nieces.
 ![Zombie Fanboy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zombie+Fanboy)**[Zombie Fanboy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Fanboy)** – *Unhinged* uncommon. Matt Cavotta's art for [Zombie Fanboy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Fanboy) contains references to Drew Tucker's art for all the following cards: [Dark Banishing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2443), [Decomposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decomposition), [Dream Fighter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Fighter), [Harmattan Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harmattan+Efreet), [Hurr Jackal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurr+Jackal), and [Warmth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warmth). [Here's a guide](http://www.wizards.com/global/images/mtgcom_daily_mc64_pic1_en.jpg) if you're having trouble spotting them.
 ![Armored Warhorse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Armored+Warhorse)**[Armored Warhorse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Warhorse)** – ***Magic** 2012* common. Although it didn't appear until ***Magic** 2012*, the flavor text on [Armored Warhorse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Warhorse) implies that it might be the mount for the [Northern Paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=260) from *Limited Edition Alpha*. There are also references to Sarlena, paladin of the Northern Verge on [Celestial Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge), [Kite Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kite+Shield), and [Personal Sanctuary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Personal+Sanctuary).
 ![Sigil of the Empty Throne](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne)**[Sigil of the Empty Throne](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne)** – *Conflux* rare. At the time that *Conflux* is set, when the five shards of alara begin to merge, the angel Asha has been dead for centuries. But no one replaced her as leader of all the angels of Bant, so her throne remained empty.
 ![Dawntreader Elk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dawntreader+Elk)**[Dawntreader Elk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawntreader+Elk)** – *Dark Ascension* common. There are [four elk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?type=+%5Belk%5D%7C%7Csubtype=+%5Belk%5D) in **Magic**. All of them were printed with the creature type "elk" except for [Gang of Elk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gang+of+Elk), which obviously needed to be included.
 ![Prince of Thralls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Prince+of+Thralls)**[Prince of Thralls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prince+of+Thralls)** – *Shards of Alara* mythic rare. [Prince of Thralls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prince+of+Thralls) is mentioned in the rules text of [Demon's Herald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demon%27s+Herald), which can get it from the library. The demon's distinctive horns are mimicked in the herald's headdress!
 ![Prismatic Wardrobe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Prismatic+Wardrobe)**[Prismatic Wardrobe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Wardrobe)** – *Unglued* common. The text box for [Prismatic Wardrobe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Wardrobe) contains sections from the backgrounds normally assigned to each individual color. It also has land and artifact sections in there, even though those aren't strictly relevant to what the card does.
 ![Lyzolda, the Blood Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lyzolda%2C+the+Blood+Witch)**[Lyzolda, the Blood Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lyzolda%2C+the+Blood+Witch)** – *Dissension* rare. [Lyzolda, the Blood Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lyzolda%2C+the+Blood+Witch) is high priestess of the cult of the demon Rakdos. Most Rakdos gatherings involve a lot of sacrificing, which is why Lyzolda also appears in the art of [Rakdos Riteknife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Riteknife).
 ![Mtenda Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mtenda+Lion)**[Mtenda Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mtenda+Lion)** – *Mirage* common. Through almost the whole playtesting process, [Mtenda Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mtenda+Lion) was unable to block blue creatures, to echo [Gibbering Hyenas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gibbering+Hyenas)'s inability to block black creatures. It was changed at the last minute because the blue decks of the era didn't play creatures.
 ![Increasing Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Increasing+Vengeance)**[Increasing Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Increasing+Vengeance)** – *Dark Ascension* rare. From the [*Dark Ascension* FAQ](/en/node/633946): *If the spell [Increasing Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Increasing+Vengeance) copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one --" or the like), the copies will have the same mode(s). You can't choose different ones. If the spell *Increasing Vengeance* copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) does), the copy has the same value of X.* 
![Sorin, Lord of Innistrad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sorin%2C+Lord+of+Innistrad)**[Sorin, Lord of Innistrad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Lord+of+Innistrad)** – *Dark Ascension* mythic rare. From the [*Dark Ascension* FAQ](/en/node/633946): *If a creature with undying is destroyed by [Sorin, Lord of Innistrad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Lord+of+Innistrad)'s third ability, the undying ability will trigger, but the creature will already have been returned to the battlefield by Sorin. The undying ability won't do anything when it resolves.*
![Wolfhunter's Quiver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wolfhunter%27s+Quiver)**[Wolfhunter's Quiver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfhunter%27s+Quiver)** – *Dark Ascension* uncommon. From the [*Dark Ascension* FAQ](/en/node/633946): *For each of the activated abilities, the equipped creature is the source of the ability and the damage. For example, if the equipped creature is not an artifact, you could activate either ability targeting a creature with protection from artifacts.*
