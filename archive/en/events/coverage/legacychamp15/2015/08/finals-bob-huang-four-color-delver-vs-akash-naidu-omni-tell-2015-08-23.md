Top 16 at Grand Prix New Jersey may not sound impressive, but at a nearly 4,500 player tournament that finish is accolade worthy. That's where we last saw Akash Naidu and Bob Huang, both missing out on a Top 8 that was incredible to crack into.


That was last fall. This year the 2015 Legacy Championship at Eternal Weekend started with 744 players, a staggering growth of more than 300 year over year. Their experience with large, long legacy tournaments paid off as they cleared a path into and through the Top 8.


Both were experienced Legacy veterans, but only one would bring home the [Tundra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tundra) trophy and 2015 Legacy Championship title.


The Decks
=========


Naidu's Omni-Tell was one of the premier decks of Legacy. Using card draw and hand sculpting spells to set up a critical turn of [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) for either [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) – allowing the rest of the card draw to chain into Eladamri's Call for Emrakul, the Aeon's Torn – for just an Emrakul outright was a deadly sequence all weekend. Surprising opponents with an unexpected turn two push proved invaluable through Naidu's march to the finals.


Huang was equipped with the now venerable [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) deck, his version pushing the established Grixis version – [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast) – into green thanks to [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) and a reconfigured manabase. Using the Shaman to accelerate mana, eat away at opponents' life totals, and even pad his own if needed added a dimension of efficiency and utility to an already powerful deck. With counterspells like [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) and cantrips like [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), Huang could pressure early or late and manage the game into his favor.


The Games
=========


The namesake [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) led the way for Huang in the first game as Naidu took time sculpting his hand with [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and more. [Insectile Aberration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) off a [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) put a quick clock under Huang's control, with [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) to accelerate the pressure.


[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), fighting through a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) from Huang with his own, put Naidu even deeper into his library. Falling to 7 life on Huang's next attack, Naidu made a mode: An unopposed [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) for [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience). Casting [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) and [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for Eladamri's Call to call up [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) was the winning sequence Huang feared.

The second game was a similar sequence for Huang, with [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) heading out first as Naidu went to work massaging his hand with [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain).


Huang took a peek with [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) but Naidu was undeterred: [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) on turn two had been effective for Naidu throughout the Top 8 and he pressed on here, though [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast) and [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) was enough for Huang to fend that off. With two [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s in hand, Hunag made sure to take care of the [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) Naidu used on his second turn, and the game slowed from there.


Hunag used [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) to scratch away at Naidu's life total as the card draw kept flowing with multiple [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s, [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), and more. [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) from Naidu was met by [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) from Huang first. [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) from Naidu in the aftermath revealed [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast) and [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) on Huang's hand, a double dose of disruption in waiting.


A second [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) from Naidu poised to put him deeper, and Huang didn't fight over it; his disruption would wait for a fight over [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell). That came next turn after Huang picked up a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) to join his defenses. Huang pointed a [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast) at it and Naidu has no response.


It didn't bode well for him.


[Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) was Huang's first threat in awhile, but it was a three turn knockout if left unopposed against Naidu. One last [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) followed by [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) resolved, but Naidu couldn't find the answers he needed.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/legacychamp15/eternalweekend15-Huang-Finals.jpg)  



The final game set off with a flurry of card draw familiar to everyone in Legacy: [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) and others give both players information as their hands were massaged. An early [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) started generating Elemental creature tokens for Huang, forcing Naidu to respond.


[Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) hit a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) wall, adding to Naidu's Elemental problem along the way. [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) was sacked by Huang's [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast), and Naidu fell to 2 life on the next attack by the Elemental horde, and with just two lands there wasn't any way for him to get out.


He gamely tapped his two lands for [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) before extending his hand.


**Bob Huang defeated Akash Naidu, 2-1, to win the 2015 Legacy Championship at Eternal Weekend!**
