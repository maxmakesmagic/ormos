**Age:** 23


**Hometown:** Vancouver, Washington


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Top 8'ed a Game Day.


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**


Grixis Kitty Pact/Cat Pact, because it's what the world needed but didn't know it should want.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


Real Answer: [Demonic Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Pact)


Fun Answer: [Dark Petition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Petition), because it's always the best card


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


Whatever counterspell was appropriate for the deck at hand. Alternatively, [Infinite Obliteration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infinite+Obliteration). Pish posh on Emrakul.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you? And what would it mean if you won?**


I'm almost too shell-shocked to say. Getting onto the Pro Tour is already unbelievable. Winning a GP would be an utterly unreal dream come true. I'd never even considered it before right now.

**What did you play this weekend, and why?**


Temur Emerge because it's great and all the other decks suck, and my cheerleader, Mike Soles, enjoys value.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Elder Deep-Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Deep-Fiend), because it won't eat my cookie dough ice cream, unlike Emrakul. #NoTrophiesTeam


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher), it allows me to kill scary Planeswalkers. #TeamFYP


**What does this Top 8 mean to you? And what would it mean if you won?**


It means that I get to go to the next PT and also that my brother, Gabriel, doesn't think I suck.

GP Portland 2013 Top 8


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**


Bant Company, trying to get back to just playing the best deck.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


Basic lands - you just want to play beautiful Revised basics every turn of every game.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


Probably [Tragic Arrogance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Arrogance), solved a few problems no other card could.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you? And what would it mean if you won?**


Helps wash the bad taste of Sydney out of my mouth. If I won it would be gone completely.

Liliana, she does so much for three mana it's unreal.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish), when it's good IT'S GREAT.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you? And what would it mean if you won?**


Back on the PT! The 8 points would be a great start to a run at Gold.

[Oath of Liliana](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Liliana) is a Planeswalker that can't be attacked.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


4th [Read the Bones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones) and 27th land for consistency

**Age:** 14


**Hometown:** San Diego, California


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Won 2 PPTQs???


Otherwise none. Only playing competitively for a year.


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**


Bant Company, because it's the only deck I know how to play well and I felt comfortable with the mirrors, which is the deck I expected to see the most.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Tamiyo, Field Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+Field+Researcher), because it improves some of your worst match-ups and crushes the mirror.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Tragic Arrogance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Arrogance), because again, it crushes the mirror and helps somewhat with [Ishkanah, Grafwidow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ishkanah%2C+Grafwidow).


**What does this Top 8 mean to you? And what would it mean if you won?**


It means a ton because it's my first Pro Tour and my first large event win.

**Age:** 19


**Hometown:** Seattle, Washington


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Nothing


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**


Bant Company, friends told me to play it.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), card is always insane.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Clash of Wills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clash+of+Wills), helps keep the board state in my favor.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you? And what would it mean if you won?**


This is my first Top 8 at a high-level tournament, so it's pretty exciting.

**Age:** 26


**Hometown:** El Monte, California


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Went 4-1 at FNM


SCG Las Vegas Open Top 16


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**


Jund Delirium. Playing Mindbender is gas. [[Distended Mindbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distended+Mindbender), that is.]


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Distended Mindbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distended+Mindbender). Ripping two cards and have a 5/5 never felt so right.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Pick the Brain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pick+the+Brain). Turn 3 taking all copies of a single card is absolutely unfair.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you? And what would it mean if you won?**


This Top 8 means the world. I have been grinding for about two years now and finally going to the Pro Tour feels amazing.
