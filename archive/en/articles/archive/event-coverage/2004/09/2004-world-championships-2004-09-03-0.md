Then you came to the right website, because Day 3 of the 2004 Magic the Gathering Championships in San Francisco is underway. As the players shuffled up for the first round of action, they could look up and see the team leaderboard that had Ukraine a single point ahead of five other teams.


In the individual standings, Kamiel Cornelissen stands apart from the pack as the lone 11-1 player in the tournament. Nicolai Herzog stumbled badly Thursday in his hunt for Player-of-the-Year honors and will try to close ground in the last lap Friday. He will have his work cut out for him -- this likely is be Gabriel Nassif's strongest leg of the competition, with a Top 8 at Pro Tour-Kobe and designer credit on two of the Top 8 decks at Grand Prix-New Jersey. Plus, he has the team competition Saturday.


Don't forget about Rickard Osterberg in this marathon. He has been hanging back just out of the top tables all weekend. His 8-3-1 record can certainly get him to the Top 8 with a strong finish Friday. We know he has already won one Constructed Pro Tour this year so he certainly has the tools. Ted Knutson will be trailing Rickard throughout the day and will have the third in our series of articles profiling the Player-of-the-Year at day's end. 


Check back all day as the field of 302 of the best players from around the globe is pared down to the elite eight who will vie for the title of 2004 **Magic: the Gathering** World Champion.
