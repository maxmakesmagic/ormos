France has long been a powerhouse in pro-level **Magic**, but the past two months have seen quite a resurgence in dominance over the world! 

 In August, Pro Tour Hall of Famer Raphaël Lévy led Team France to victory at the [World **Magic** Cup](/en/events/coverage/l%C3%A9vy-du-soleil-en-france). This victory was notable as it filled out the nation's collective trophy case with France's first team victory at the Pro Tour level.

 Then, just a two days ago, [Grand Prix Lyon](/en/events/coverage/jund-jolts-jeremy-top) winner Jérémy Dezani also won [Pro Tour *Theros*](/en/events/coverage/dezani-proclaims-allez-les-bleus-pro-tour).

That's a pretty great back-to-back for France, but perhaps "dominance" is a bit of hyperbole? Well, let me expand on the Pro Tour a bit.

Not only was the PT winner from France, but so to were two other members of the Top 8. Yup, three of the eight players in the Top 8 were from France (for the record, two each were from Japan and the United States, with Hall of Famer Kamiel Cornelissen alone representing Netherlands). Those other two Frenchmen were longtime pro Guillame Wafo-Tapa and up-and-comer Pierre Dagen.

 Oh, and I'll just casually mention here that Jérémy's opponent in the finals was his teammate and countryman, Pierre, giving us an all-French Pro Tour *Theros* finals. 


*Très Magnifique*!
