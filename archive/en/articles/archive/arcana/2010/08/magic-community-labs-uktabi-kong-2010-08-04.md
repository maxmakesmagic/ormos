![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/tcg/resources/summerofmultiplayer.jpg)On August 8th at 10 am, Magic Players at Gen Con will become game poachers and turn their sights on the legendary Uktabi Kong. 

The [**Magic** Community Labs program](/en/articles/archive/magic-community-labs-2010-06-07) yielded some really exciting formats and after reviewing them, our R&D department has declared [Uktabi Kong](http://community.wizards.com/magicthegathering/go/thread/view/93421/25070453/Powerstone) (formerly Powerstone) the winner! They had to tweak it a bit to make sure it would work in a sealed tournament at Gen Con, and gave it the face of a huge Orangutan, but the soul of the thing is straight from the Magic Community Labs.

So without further ado, here are the rules:

### Uktabi Kong

A multiplayer format for 4â€“6 players.

**Before the Game**

An identification deck is created with one card for each player in the game. One card is a Swamp, the other cards are Forests (other basic lands may be used, as long as one of the cards is unique and the others are identical to one another). Randomly deal out these cards. The person who draws the Swamp is Uktabi Kong. The other players are Poachers. **Do not reveal your identity unless instructed to by the rules below.**

**Playing the Game**




* Uktabi Kong is a Free-for-All multiplayer game with no range of influence. Each player may attack any other player (or multiple players at once).
* Whenever a player is eliminated from the game by another player, he or she reveals his or her identity. If the eliminated player was a Poacher, the game continues. If the eliminated player is Uktabi Kong, the game ends and the player who eliminated Uktabi Kong wins (see Scoring, below).
* If a player is eliminated, but not by another player (for example, concession, being decked, or intentionally damaging him or herself), the eliminated player reveals his or her identity. If he or she was a Poacher, the game continues. If he or she was Uktabi Kong, a new Uktabi Kong is secretly selected using the method explained above. (Note: a player forcing another player to draw with an empty library does not count as eliminating that player)
* A player who concedes or eliminates him or herself is disqualified from the event. If a player is decked, he or she still loses but may continue in the event.
* When a player controls creatures with total power 20 or greater, that player reveals his or her identity. If he or she is a Poacher, the game continues. If he or she is Uktabi Kong, the game ends and that player wins (see Scoring, below). *For example: A player controls creatures with total power 14 and casts Yavimaya Wurm (a 6/6 creature). Players may respond to the Yavimaya Wurm while it is on the stack as normal. When it resolves, players can't respond to the identity of that player being revealed.*
* If the last player in the game is Uktabi Kong, that player wins (see Scoring, below)

**Scoring**




* If a Poacher wins the game, he or she scores points equal to the number of players who started the game.
* If Uktabi Kong wins the game, he or she scores points equal to the number of players who started the game plus the number of players who were eliminated before the game ended. *For example, an Uktabi Kong who wins a 5-player game by eliminating all of his or her opponents would score 9 points for the round (5 players + 4 eliminations).*

Sound fun? It is. Get your Warlord's Axe sharpened up, Polish up that Jinxed Idol and get that Sacred Wolf on the scent, it's time to hunt some Uktabi Kong!
