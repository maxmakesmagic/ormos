You remember *[Duel Decks: Jace vs. Chandra](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_jacevschandra_productinfo)*, right? Two 60-card decks featuring keen alternate-art foils of [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) and [Chandra Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Nalaar). Now, do you also remember [the **Magic** manga](/en/articles/archive/magic-manga-2010-03-02) from Dengeki-Maoh?


Here's the news. First, you can read [the manga online](http://dol.dengeki.com/mtg/comic/). If you don't read Japanese, all you need to do is get a copy of *The Purifying Fire* and follow along.


And second, *Jace vs. Chandra* is back. In Japanese!

This version of *Jace vs. Chandra* is a JAPANESE LANGUAGE ONLY reissue of the popular Duel Deck. The two mythic rare Planeswalker cards feature brand-new art from Japanese manga artist Yoshino Himori, artist for of the Dengeki adaptation of Laura Resnickâ€™s novel "The Purifying Fire."


Everything about this is the same as the English version, except that it's in Japanese only and that the two foil Planeswalkers will have new art. *This* new art:
