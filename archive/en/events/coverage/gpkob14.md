DAY 2 COVERAGE
--------------


As a gray dawn breaks at Port Island in Kobe, 243 competitors have returned to the International Exhibition Hall with their minds on one thing: The Top 8. Seven players have a leg up on the competition, having run the tables on Day 1 to perfect 9-0 records. They are Yuusei Gotou, Yuta Hirosawa, Motoshi Kouyama, Kenta Masukado, Yuki Matsumoto, Lai Pak Yin, and Maeno Kazuha. The road up from 7-2 will be difficult, but we're keeping eyes on players like 17th Ranked Lee Shi Tian, Pro Tour Kobe Champion (and semi-retired mage) Masashiro Kuroda, newly-minted Hall of Famer Makihito Mihara, and others as they try to win out. Nothing less than a 6-0 sweep will do.


Once again, Modern Constructed is a garden of delights. The watchwords this weekend are "preparation" and "sideboard". Players are sticking to the strategies that work for them, heeding the professional wisdom that in this format the biggest edge you can get comes from deck knowledge. The other consequence of the wide-open field is that sideboard versatility is key. Will those players who have stuck by the format's Big 4 decks suffer from being expected, or will they prove that those decks are unshakeably Tier 1? Will up-and-comers like Scapeshift, Blue-White-Red Control, and Burn steal the spotlight? What forgotten archetype will surprise us with a Top 8 appearance? We're just six rounds away from the Top 8. Stay tuned!

DAY 1 COVERAGE
--------------



 Day One of the largest Japanese Constructed Grand Prix has drawn to a close, and where once there were 2270 mages full of burning hopes, now there stand just 243 who will return tomorrow to settle things. Seven players pace the field with perfect 9-0 records: Yuusei Gotou, Yuta Hirosawa, Motoshi Kouyama, Kenta Masukado, Yuki Matsumoto, Lai Pak Yin, and Maeno Kazuha. Close on their heels at 8-1 are the likes of 14th Ranked Yuuki Ichikawa, Shouta Yasooka, and Kuo Tzu-Ching. In a field this large starting 7-2 means needing a perfect Day 2, so players like 17th-Ranked Lee Shi-Tian, Hall of Famer Makihito Mihara, and two-time Pro Tour Top 8'er Akira Asahara will have to summon the kind of performance that made them famous. Perhaps the city could prove lucky again for Pro Tour Kobe Champion Masashiro Kuroda?




Modern continues to be the playground of brews and pet decks. The Big 4 (Twin, Pod, Affinity, and Rock) are still putting up big numbers, but we're seeing strong surges of things like Scapeshift, Blue-White-Red Control, and Burn. Knowing that sideboards are stretched to the breaking point by the wide-open field, savvy players are trying to win the 75-card matchup by playing decks that dodge the most ubiquitous hate. At Grand Prix Boston-Worcester the surprise was Infect, what will see here? Will a field jam-packed with amateur talent upset the resident pros? Tune in tomorrow as six rounds of Swiss will decide our Top 8!
