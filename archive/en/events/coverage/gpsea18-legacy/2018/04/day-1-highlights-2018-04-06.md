Day One of GP Seattle meant the start of not two but THREE days of thrilling Grand Prix play, plus cosplay, coverage, and side events galore. While yesterday eager players flocked to the convention center hall to battle their Brawl decks or get a leg up on the competition by winning a Last Chance Trial, today things really got underway with the start of the Legacy Grand Prix.


While the weather outside was a mix of Seattle's classic fog and rain, inside the Washington Convention Center, over 1,600 players set their sights clearly on the Legacy trophy. The last time players had a chance to flex their Legacy muscles (in a non-team event) at the Grand Prix level was last year in Las Vegas, when Death and Taxes conquered the field.


With some of the most powerful cards and impressive synergies in *Magic* hitting the table, the field was wide open, but at the end of the day only 11 players remained undefeated. Tomorrow, all players with a record of 6-2 or better will return to fight for a place in the Legacy Top 8 while, across the hall, Standard gets underway.


Of course, Legacy was far from the only thing happening in the convention hall, which was alive with Commander, Limited events of all kinds, and iconic *Magic* characters walking the room.


Brawl with Wizards
==================


Grand Prix are always full of fun opportunities for players who aren’t sure that the main event is for them, from side events to Marshall Sutcliffe sightings. This weekend, those opportunities include the chance to try out one of *Magic*'s newest formats against some bonafide Wizards.

Wizards of the Coast headquarters is just a few miles south of Seattle, in Renton, Washington, and thanks to that proximity, GP Seattle is full of seldom-seen wizards responsible for bringing *Magic* sets from the very beginnings of ideas to the boosters, cards, and decks you see in your local game stores.

This weekend, they’re here playing Brawl, a brand-new *Magic* format that mashes up Standard and Commander for a multiplayer experience that’s super friendly for players who haven’t tried their hand at singleton formats, and super fun for those who have. You can read more about Brawl [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ways-play/join-brawl-2018-03-22).


Of course, if you’re not ready to Brawl, there are other formats and other spellslingers to take on, some of them more illustrious than others.

Cosplay Abounds!
================


We’re only a few weeks away from an exciting return to one of *Magic*'s most iconic and history-filled planes - Dominaria. With preview season for Dominaria in full swing, some ambitious cosplayers took the opportunity to craft some of the freshest creations possible.

Cosplayer MJ Scott had a particularly unique opportunity at GP Seattle – she was able to cosplay a card that, up until Friday morning, no one else knew about yet. Her cosplay for Tetsuko Umezawa, which Scott previewed this morning, was made possible in part by the fact that Scott wrote the flavor text on the card.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/events/gpsea18-legacy/d1h_umezawacard.png)


“I was really excited about this card because the Umezawa clan is so important in *Magic*'s history. Tetsuko’s ancestor one time took down Nicol Bolas. Basically the entire Gatewatch just failed at that," Scott said of Tetsuko. “I think that’s a pretty awesome legacy, so it was basically taking a new spin on it, on having a woman representing the clan. We wanted her to be cool, we wanted her to be representative, and I think that, for me, as an Asian-American woman, it meant a lot to me, because she’s a really cool Asian character. And, you know, Umezawa’s Jitte is a really powerful card, and so it was really cool that they rebooted this and made it a fresh character."

Other cosplayers went with classic Dominarian favorites, some of them returning, like Jhoira, who’s captaining the Weatherlight on Dominaria, or [Hanna](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanna), who’s gone but certainly not forgotten.

Dana Fischer Gets Her First Legacy Win
======================================


One of *Magic*'s youngest and most well-traveled mages added yet another accomplishment to her already impressive list today. Seven-year-old Dana Fischer, who has the goal of soon becoming the youngest player to make Day 2 of a Grand Prix, got her first Legacy win in Round 3 of GP Seattle.

The Legacy 1-2-3
================


For *Magic* fans unfamiliar with Legacy, there are three things it’s important to know: 1. 2. 3.


By which I mean nearly all the converted mana costs you’ll see in Legacy equal either one, two, or three mana. Of course, there are always exceptions (and in Legacy, they are some truly wild exceptions).


* [![Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Brainstorm)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)
* [![Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ponder)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)
* [![Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Delver+of+Secrets)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets)
* [![Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Young+Pyromancer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer)
* [![Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Deathrite+Shaman)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman)

Legacy’s popular one-, two-, and three-drops include classic deck manipulation and card drawing spells like [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), cheap creatures that still pack a punch, like [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), and [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis), and removal or disruption like [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares), and Kolaghan’s Command.


* [![Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn)
* [![Gurmag Angler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gurmag+Angler)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Angler)
* [![Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Griselbrand)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand)
* [![Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Force+of+Will)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will)

If a spell costs more than that, there’s a good chance that there’s a way to sidestep that cost. [Gurmag Angler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Angler), for instance, has delve. Emrakul, the Aeon’s Torn can be put into play with a [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) or a [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack), while [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) can come back from the graveyard with a [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate). Then, of course, there’s the iconic [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), which players can cast by exiling a blue card from their hand and paying one life.


Among pro players, Four-Color Control was a popular deck choice, but Lands, Death and Taxes, Tin Fin, and Elves also put in appearances.


Undefeated Players
==================


Day One of Grand Prix Seattle (Legacy Version) is in the books, and though over 1600 players entered the field at the start of the day, only eleven stood unscathed at the end of it.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/events/gpsea18-legacy/d1h_undefeated.jpg)


The Day One undefeated players were Kusakabe Kyohei from Japan, Luke Purcell from Washington D.C., Noah Walker from Massachusetts, Justin Gennari from Rhode Island, Keaton Wood from San Diego, Travis Hilley from Klamath Falls, Oregon, Michael Reed from St. Louis, Daniel Duterte from Seattle, John Mcdermott from South Bend, Indiana, Brian Braun-Duin from Richmond, Virginia, and Seth Manfield from Maryland.


Their decks included five copies of Grixis Delver, three copies of Four-Color Control, two copies of Miracles, and one copy of Storm.


Congratulations to the Grand Prix Seattle Day One undefeated players!
