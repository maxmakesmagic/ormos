"Want to counter my [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell)?"

"End of turn, I copy my [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) with [Thespian's Stage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thespian%27s+Stage) and create an indestructible 20/20 token?"  

"Sure."  

"Untap? Draw?"  

"Sure."  

"Attack you for 20?"  

"Nah, you forgot to pay for [The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Tabernacle+at+Pendrell+Vale) you got lying around there, so you actually need to sacrifice your indestructible 20/20."

"Tobi, that story about the indestructible 20/20 token and [The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Tabernacle+at+Pendrell+Vale) doesn't actually work that way." "It doesn't?"  

"The Tabernacle doesn't force players to sacrifice their creatures but destroys them, so it won't ever touch any indestructible creature."  

"Oh. That's bad. I never realized—and neither did the players in that story!"  

"How unlucky!"
