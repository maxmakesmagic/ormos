Play Dominaria Starting April 20 on Magic Online
================================================

As a long-time *Magic* player, I love seeing characters like Jhoira, Jaya Ballard, Squee, and I guess some other characters who aren't red for some reason from *Magic*'s history return. Welcome (back) to Dominaria!


For *Dominaria* on *Magic Online*, we're starting Sealed Leagues on Friday, April 20, at 10 a.m. PT. You can get in a quick Sealed League before heading to your local game store and playing in a weekend Prerelease event there! Or you can play at home all weekend if you like. These will be normal Sealed Leagues, both the Competitive and Friendly options. You can see the full details at the bottom of this article.


Draft Leagues will begin Monday, April 23, at 10 a.m. PT. Exciting news on this front as well! We're replacing the existing Friendly Draft League structure with an old standby: Pack-Per-Win. You can play three matches, and you'll be awarded a booster for each match you win. All matches will be best-of-three games. For those who prefer the Competitive or Intermediate structures, those are still available and aren't changing. Have fun!


BRAWL
=====


Gavin Verhey recently [announced Brawl](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ways-play/join-brawl-2018-03-22), a new format that's basically 60-card Standard Commander. *Magic Online* is going to be supporting this format. You'll be able to play it in the open play rooms—both 1v1 and multiplayer—and we'll be supporting 1v1 play with a Friendly League! Brawl play will consist of single-game matches. It will otherwise have the same structure as the other Friendly Leagues. You can see the bottom of this article for more details. We hope you have fun with this new format! To help it grow, we'll also be adding a Format Challenge for Brawl, which will begin each Sunday at 12 p.m. PT. Format Challenges are large Swiss events that cut to a Top 8 and award large prizes to top-finishing players. So, who's your Brawl commander?


1V1 COMMANDER
=============


We want to reinvigorate the 1v1 Commander format and are taking a couple steps to do so. First, we are going to change the League from Competitive back to Friendly, as we think it will be more approachable and better suits the best-of-one match format. Additionally, we are working with *Magic* R&D to examine what if any changes to the banned list may benefit the format. Any changes will be announced on the [*Magic Online* Tumblr](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/) on Monday, April 16.


UPCOMING EVENT SCHEDULE
=======================


After you've had some time to play with *Dominaria* for a while, we'll have some extra things on the schedule that we think you'll be interested in!


* May 16–23: Triple *Lorwyn* Flashbacks. This was delayed from earlier this year, but now it's here! Your favorite tribal shenanigans in one wacky format. Mind the board state!
* May 23–30: Designer Alli Medwin has been spearheading a new initiative, which will start this week. More details to come!
* May 30–June 6: CHK-CHK-BOK flashbacks. Mark Rosewater's Tumblr has been asking for *Kamigawa*. Well, here's your chance to relive it! We chose this version of the Draft format because it has performed well in the past and is generally highly regarded.
* June 6–13: Last year's Battle of the Planes was a hit, so we're bringing it back in 2018 for another week. We'll mix up the planes some from last time, but this choose-your-own-plane Phantom Sealed event should be a blast.
* June 13–July 6: My next event needs no introduction: Vintage Cube. You know it and love it. This will be three and a half weeks full of Power Nine goodness right up until *Core Set 2019* comes out. Remember, if you see WotC\_Lee in your pod, stay out of mono-red!

REDEMPTION POLICY UPDATE
========================


Now that *Magic* is moving from two-set blocks to single sets that are their own Limited environment, *Magic Online*'s Redemption Policy is changing accordingly. Redemption sets will continue to go on sale 30 days after boosters for the set go on sale in the *Magic Online* store. (For *Dominaria*, boosters will go on sale April 27, so redemptions will go on sale beginning May 23.)


Redemptions will be guaranteed to be available for fifteen weeks, starting when they become available. After the fifteen weeks are over, they will continue to be available either for another five weeks or until inventory runs out, whichever happens earlier.


PRESTIGE AVATARS
================


Earn trophies in Constructed and *Dominaria* Limited Leagues to earn prestige avatars! Here are the avatars for *Dominaria*: Jhoira, Weatherlight Captain is the silver prestige avatar, the *Weatherlight* itself is the gold prestige avatar, and Jaya Ballard is the mythic orange prestige avatar!

TREASURE CHEST UPDATES
======================


As is tradition, *Magic Online* Treasure Chests are being updated for *Dominaria*. The updated version will take effect starting Monday, April 23. We'll be adding a new Treasure Chest avatar (and boosting the chances of getting one instead of a Standard common or uncommon): Squee, the Immortal! Everyone likes Squee, right? You get to squee! And it's a red card! Anyway, here's the avatar:

The curated list is going through some changes as well, of course. You can see the changes here:
