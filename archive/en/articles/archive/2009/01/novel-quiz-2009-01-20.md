Let's try something a little different. Instead of an "Art Quiz" where we show you snippets of art and you guess what card they're from (as with [this example from Shards of Alara](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1695), we're doing a Novel Quiz. We show you the first sentence of several **Magic** novels and you guess which book they're from.


When you want to see the answers, just click on the sentence and the correct book cover will appear as if by magic.
