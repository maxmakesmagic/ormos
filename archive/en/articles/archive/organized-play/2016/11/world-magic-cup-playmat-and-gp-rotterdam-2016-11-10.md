 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 






The [2016 World *Magic* Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/2016wmc) is just over a week away, but you'll have your first chance to see some of the teams in action this weekend, as many of next week's competing teams along with some of the heavy-hitter Team Limited trios will face off in Grand Prix Rotterdam's two-day main event.


We have some updated information regarding this week's coverage of Rotterdam, specifically the start times, but before we get into that I'd like to show off one of the event exclusives that will be available for purchase at the World *Magic* Cup next week.


World *Magic* Cup Playmat
=========================


As with Pro Tours, the World *Magic* Cup will also have an event-exclusive playmat at the merch booth that visitors have the chance to purchase. This year's playmat meshes the Planeswalker group shot from [Dramatic Reversal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dramatic+Reversal) with a skyline shot showcasing De Rotterdam, one of the many unusual and intriguing architectural designs existing in a city skyline that is, fittingly, very modern.

The World *Magic* Cup will take place November 18–20 and feature 73 countries as they compete across *Kaladesh* Team Sealed and Team Unified Modern for their share of $250,000 and the title of 2016 World *Magic* Cup Champions. Tune in starting at 10 a.m. local time (CET)/1 a.m. PT/4 a.m. ET/9 a.m. UTC on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) to see which countries rise to the top!


Grand Prix Rotterdam
====================


Get your first taste of team action by tuning in to [Grand Prix Rotterdam](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gprot16) coverage this weekend! Keep in mind that, unlike other events, the start times for a Team Grand Prix are a bit different than usual. This is a result of the initial start-of-day Sealed pool registration. We intend to go live and show you a recorded Round 1 feature match.


Below you'll find that information along with the commentator crew, and you can always follow twitch.tv/magic to get notifications on when we go live!


This weekend's crew features a lean toward our European team, along with North American play-by-play guest Brian David-Marshall and Asia-Pacific's writer-reporter guest Chapman Sim.


* **Start Times**: Saturday, November 12 at 11:00 a.m. local time (CET)/2:00 a.m. PT/5:00 a.m. ET/10:00 a.m. UTC, and Sunday, November 13 at 10:30 a.m. local time (CET)/1:30 a.m. PT/4:30 a.m. ET/9:30 a.m. UTC
