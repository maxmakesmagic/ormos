Tarkir is disarray and chaos. With five clans vying for your attention, this seems like a format that is rather difficult to decipher. You'll try to figure out which clan offers the best synergy, while a myriad of Morph creatures muddle the waters and cloud your judgement.

*Welcome to [Sarkhan Vol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Vol)'s hometown!* 




The concerns surrounding the manabase are legitimate. It's somewhat a multi-colored set after all, or can you do well enough by sticking to just two? Nobody is quite sure how many lands to run, and many players agree that there is a huge difference between 16, 17 and 18. Are the banners any good or are they borderline average? How high do you pick the dual-colored lands and the tri-colored lands? Heck, we don't even have consensus on whether it's better to play or draw in Sealed. Things will become even more complex in Booster Draft today as these issues continue to challenge everyone in the room.


Then there's the issue of speed. How fast is the format? Do you want to hop onto the driver's seat and be hyper-aggressive with a bunch of two drops in a world of threes and fives, or go over the top and stall the board with a bunch of defenders before letting your expensive, powerful cards take over the game? How good are tempo spells and combat tricks?

 Where's a bottle of Xanax when I need one? Fortunately for me, now that the rosters for the World *Magic* Cup are set, it seemed like the best opportunity to pick the brains of the top Pros of some of the top countries in the region. What's everyone's take on *Khans of Tarkir*? I figured it would be a great idea to hear a little advice from the very best.
