Pro Tour–Honolulu Qualifying Season: Extended Top 8 Decklists
=============================================================












![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/protour/images/qt_lg.jpg) Punch your ticket to Honolulu by winning a Pro Tour Qualifier! Seeded with decklists from [Pro Tour-Los Angeles](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/decklists-complete-decklists-f-2005-10-29), the Extended format is loaded with archetypes.


Now you can test each decklist thanks to our new [Sample Hand Generator](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/294). Just click on the card fan in the upper right of each decklist and you can see what your opening hand could be, along with mulligans and the first three cards you'd draw.


Decklists will be updated every Thursday during the PTQ season. To find a PTQ near you, [click here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=protour/honolulu06/qualifiers). [Pro Tour-Honolulu](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=protour/honolulu06/facts) is scheduled for March 3-5, 2006.
