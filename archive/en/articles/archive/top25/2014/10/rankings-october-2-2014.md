Welcome to our latest look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. It's possible that you're getting impatient for things to change—our Top 25 has been locked in place since the last Grand Prix weekend, way back at the start of September. Well that quiet month is now consigned to the history books, and October is certain to shake up the standings in seismic fashion.



The month opens with a pair of Grand Prix this coming weekend. In Orlando, expect to see many European pros en route to the Pro Tour, trying their luck with *Khans of Tarkir* Sealed Deck, and (hopefully) Draft on day two, if they make it that far. For the likes of No. 10 Yuuki Ichikawa, No. 11 Yuuya Watanabe, No. 17 Lee Shi Tian, and No. 24 Kentaro Yamamoto, their option for Khans Limited action is much closer to home, with the fabulous city of Shanghai providing the backdrop to another weekend of gold-card exploration.



Once the pros have taken their chances with the 40-card format, it's time for the big one—Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* in Honolulu. Nothing stirs up the rankings quite like a Pro Tour. There are hundreds of points to be given out, and hundreds more to be taken away, as last year's results begin to significantly decay. As our No. 1 ranked player, nobody has more to lose than France's Jérémy Dezani. Together with his Team Revolution, they'll be looking to repeat their incredible success from this time last year, when both Dezani and Pierre Dagen reached the final of [Pro Tour *Theros*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptths13/welcome).



Once the dust settles in Hawaii, it's on to Grand Prix in Los Angeles, Stockholm, Nashville, and Santiago, all before the month's out. It has been quiet here at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings…but it's about to get very, very loud.
