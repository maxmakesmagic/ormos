*Every December we allow our dedicated staff to take a vacation by running two Best Of weeks where we rerun the best of the year. My tradition for my column is that I always use the first week to run what I thought was my favorite article on design and I use my second week to run my personal favorite column.*

*As it's the first week, you get a meaty design article today. Having done [Five Hundred and Counting](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/155) recently, I had most of this year's articles graded, so I looked through all my five-star columns. My favorite ended up being one I hadn't graded yet.*

*Here are my runner ups:*


> * *[Mana Action](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/144)*
> * *[Nuts amp; Bolts: Filling In The Design Skeleton](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/132)*
> * *[Let's See What Develops](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/125)*
> * *[The Bleed Story](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/147)*
> 

*The winning column was actually a two-parter that was inspired by a speech I gave to my daughter's fifth-grade class about game design. I had been meaning to write the column for about half a year, but other topics kept popping up that were more topical. I eventually got to it, and I was very happy with how it (and the speech) turned out. If you have any interest in designing any kind of game, I strongly urge you to give this a read.*

*Happy holidays, everyone!*
