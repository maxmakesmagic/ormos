Back to Back for LSV
====================




October 25












Grand Prix Atlanta 2008
-----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpatl08/lsvchamp.jpg)


It's kind of hard to believe that just a couple of weeks ago, we were watching Luis Scott-Vargas hoist his first Pro Tour trophy and here he is again hoisting his second Grand Prix champion trophy. Back-to-back victories are almost inconceivable, and yet LSV has managed to do just that, and even across completely different formats! LSV has proven his skill time and again, and his victory here just cements that he is one of the best all-around players in the world. Luis Scott-Vargas has definitely earned the right to be named the Grand Prix-Atlanta champion!
