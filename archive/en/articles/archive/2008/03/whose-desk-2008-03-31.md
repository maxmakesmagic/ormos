For today's Magic Arcana, we're giving you a chance to pretend you're a member of R&D! Unfortunately, you're a junior member (you've only been in the department since the begining of the paragraph, after all!), so your job is to carry things from desk to desk. And no one seems to have their name on their desk!


So: can you guess which member of R&D belongs to which desk? To make it a little easier, we're using only people who either write for **magicthegathering.com**, used to write for **magicthegathering.com**, or have done Dossiers.



### Challenge One: Mark Rosewater


You've got an urgent idea that has to get straight to the head of **Magic** design. But no one's home! Mouse over the thumbnails to see your options, and then click on the thumbnail that you believe to be Mark's desk. Choose wisely!

### Challenge Two: Devin Low


Well done! By hanging around Mark's desk all day, you managed to grab his attention. And he likes your idea! Next, you've got to get it through Development, and that means Devin Low. Can you tell which desk is his?

### Challenge Three: Aaron Forsythe


Devin likes your idea too, but he's not ready to sign off on it yet. You have one final challenge: find the desk of Aaron Forsythe, Director of **Magic** R&D. Where's Aaron?

### Postgame: Celebration


Wow! Aaron seems to *love* your idea! Maybe he's just happy because he has a giant [Castle Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle+Sengir) in his office. Either way, congratulations!
