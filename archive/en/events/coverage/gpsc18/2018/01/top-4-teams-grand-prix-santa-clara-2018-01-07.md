Qualified for two PTs via Legacy.


MOCS 2016 Top 4.

Hardcast [Mindbreak Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindbreak+Trap).


**How did working with your teammates help you in the tournament? Was there a particular moment that stands out from this weekend?**


I usually finished my match before my teammates, and they didn't need much help since they're both excellent players. I did enjoy giving Vidi bad advice and still seeing him win.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


A lot; the twelve-hour flight was worth it. Being able to play Legacy at PT 25 is awesome!

**Age:** 23


**Hometown:** Davis, California


**Occupation:** Behavioral Therapist


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** 


Grand Prix Day 2, PTQ Old System Top 8s, some PPTQ Top 8s, and a couple wins, some other stuff. Mostly just this.


**What format and deck did you play and why?**


Modern, Mardu Pyro/Reveler. I like playing "fair" hyper-interactive strategies, and the deck is quite powerful. Also, I like pretty much all the cards in the deck an unhealthy amount.


**What card surprised you the most this weekend?**


Probably [Bedlam Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bedlam+Reveler). Not really a "surprise" it is reaffirmed how sweet it is.


**How did working with your teammates help you in the tournament? Was there a particular moment that stands out from this weekend?**


My teammates were helpful in though spots (stating the obvious). I would say the stand out was winning our win-and-in.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


It means my first Pro Tour qualification after five years of grinding. Feelsgoodman.

**How did working with your teammates help you in the tournament? Was there a particular moment that stands out from this weekend?**

I get to go to Minneapolis with my two buddies!

Staying alive at 1 life versus Temur, then ultimating a Nicol Bolas, God Pharaoh to win.

Pro Tour, a second chance at gravy, $$.
