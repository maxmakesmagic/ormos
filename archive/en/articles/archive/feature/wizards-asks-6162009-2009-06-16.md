*When was your first tournament, and what happened?*


  
**Mark Globus:** The first tournament I played in was in the Fall of 1994, after *The Dark* was released. It was the equivalent of Vintage format, though I don't believe that the distinction existed at that time. I played a White Weenie deck, and was proudly sporting my full set of four [Army of Allah](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Army+of+Allah)s, but these failed to compete with various Moxen and other power cards that were floating around. I went 1-2 and then was dropped from the double-elimination tournament.


![Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Black+Lotus)  
Humorously, I recall seeing a full set of [Moxen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?name=+%5Bmox%5D&set=%5B%22Unlimited%20Edition%22) plus a [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) being sold prior to the tournament for $130, and I thought it was crazyâ€”who would buy six cards for that much? Not long after the tournament, I wished I had!
