The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on December 14, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by a [Paradoxical Colossus](#9).


Today's Must
============


1. [Channel LSV—Holiday Cube Draft](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-lsv-holiday-cube-draft-8/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

Oh happy day, *Vintage Cube* is back! (It used to be called the *Holiday Cube*.) If there's anyone you want to watch draft the most powerful of *Magic Online* cubes, it's LSV. Enjoy each and every pun, self-depreciating comment, and broken interaction.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Art with Tom](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/snacktimewithmikeandant-12142016-snack-time-45-art-with-tom) | Gathering Magic | Mike Linnemann and Ant Tessitore

Tom Wanerstrand, one of *Magic*'s art greats, stops by Snack Time with Mike and Ant to talk, what else, art. The man painted [City of Shadows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Shadows). [City of Shadows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Shadows)!


1. [A Frozen Standard Metagame?](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/a-frozen-standard-metagame/) | ChannelFireball | Josh Silvestri

This is one of the most complete breakdowns of how the Standard metagame did something odd this time around—shifted slowly yet somehow suddenly at the same time, with the Grand Prix events in Madrid and Denver.


1. [Captain's Log: Take Notes](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13679&writer=Conley+Woods&articledate=12-14-2016) | TCGPlayer | Conley Woods

It's the little things that count, and Woods recounts how you can count on the little things being difficult to track and improve on in *Magic*. But those little things add up in a big way, and it's no small feat to see a large improvement in your game over a short amount of time just by taking a big interest in the most minute details.


1. [Eternal Week](http://www.constructedcriticism.com/podcasts/constructed-criticism-165-eternal-week/) | Constructed Criticism | Spencer Howland, Casey Bloodworth, and Michael Hinderaker

"He couldn't make the podcast, but he qualified for the Pro Tour," is one of the best *Magic*-related excuses possible for not being on your own podcast. Second only to "I'm going to work for Wizards of the Coast." Or at least I like to think so every time I watch another Pro Tour qualifier season pass me by.


Top 25
======


1. A little off the top, a lot off the back

Not much movement at the top of the rankings this week, but there's a ton once you get below No. 15. Matthew Nass and Ryoichi Tamada both screamed up into the Top 20 this week, up six spots each. Plus, we have the re-re-return of our World Champion, Brian Braun-Duin, at No. 24. That means Oliver Tiu, our Rookie of the Year from last year, gets pushed to just outside the Top 25. Not that he'll stay there for long.


Check out the rest of the Top 25 below.

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Seeing the answers to this has got me thinking... what's your favorite Standard format ever? What's the 10? And what's the 1? <https://t.co/Kxj9zLjfdF>

>  — Paulo Vitor (@PVDDR) [December 13, 2016](https://twitter.com/PVDDR/status/808706092356292610)

Thanks to [a tweet from Sam Stoddard](https://twitter.com/samstod/status/808572393346076676), there was a lot of conversation yesterday about how people felt about the current Standard. But then *that* turned into a conversation about the best Standard formats of all time. I tend to like this Standard more than most (it always helps when there's a [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) in the format), but answers varied wildly and interestingly. I, for example, will always have a soft spot in my heart for *Kamigawa*–*Ravnica*-era Standard.


A lengthy Reddit thread concerning Stoddard's original tweet also ensued, but the [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5ia30y/sam_stoddard_asks_about_the_quality_of_standard/db6l3sn/) pretty wonderfully sums up a lot of the opinions of people who just want to play and have fun how they want to have fun. That said, [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5ia30y/sam_stoddard_asks_about_the_quality_of_standard/db6jst0/) pretty well sums up the opinions of (reasonable) people on the other side.


1. [[*Magic* Story] Breakthrough](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5ib6fr/magic_story_breakthrough/)

It's Wednesday, which means it's crazy *Magic* Story theory day! Grab your nicest tinfoil hat, read the [latest episode of *Magic* Story](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/breakthrough-2016-12-14), and go ahead and share that theory about how you're pretty sure the [Myojin of Night's Reach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myojin+of+Night%27s+Reach) is secretly controlling [Nicol Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=260991) in order to release [Marit Lage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=416746) so that the Phyrexians can compleat Dominaria, just like their leader [Teferi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=389712) told [Koth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=266362) to make them do while they were hiding out on Ravnica with the Dimir, all of which was orchestrated by [Baron Sengir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir) in order to get another *Homelands* expansion. (Note: Dear lord, none of that is actually true.)


Deck of the Day
===============


1. Paradoxical Colossus

Combine one part [Metalwork Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalwork+Colossus) deck, one part [Paradoxical Outcome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradoxical+Outcome), and a whole heaping of cost reductions, and you have this beauty of a deck that went 4-0 at a recent Standard Showdown. I know I'm in love.


[Aetherflux Reservoir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflux+Reservoir) has been a card I've tried to make work a number of different ways, but have, so far, fallen short. But one talented player might just have cracked it with this deck. The key is the octet of cost reducers in [Herald of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Kozilek) and [Foundry Inspector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foundry+Inspector). Once you have two of those on the board, the various [Prophetic Prism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Prism)s and [Metalspinner's Puzzleknot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalspinner%27s+Puzzleknot)s become free, cycling through your deck (anyone remember the old [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator) deck?). Once you have three or four cost reducers in play, well, all bets are off.


The genius is that, yes, you can try to set up the [Paradoxical Outcome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradoxical+Outcome), [Aetherflux Reservoir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflux+Reservoir), cost reducers combo to draw a ton of cards—or you can play just like a normal [Metalwork Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalwork+Colossus) deck, powering out giant robot monsters to run all over your opponent. But if that won't work? How about doming your opponent for 50 when you do go off?


Just a small play hint: play your Heralds before your [Foundry Inspector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foundry+Inspector)s. Inspectors might be played later for free. Heralds will always cost you two mana.
