Squirrel!


I'm sorry, I'm not sure that was excited enough for this week's wallpaper.


SQUIRREL!!!


That's better, but it still doesn't match the internet's collective reaction to the art on the long awaited Squirrel Token from *Conspiracy*.

While this isn't the first time we've seen a Squirrel token (or the first time we've seen the [Squirrel's Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel%27s+Nest) enchantment that produces Squirrels), the art by Daniel Ljunggren has quickly become a fan favorite. So, for all of the Squirrel fans out there (SQUIRREL!!!), we've created wallpapers for your amusement.


Enjoy!
