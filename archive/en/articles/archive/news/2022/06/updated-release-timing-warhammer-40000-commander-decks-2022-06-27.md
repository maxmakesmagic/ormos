Due to ongoing global supply chain challenges and delays in production, the global release of *Warhammer 40,000* Commander decks is now October 7, 2022. This release date change includes both the regular and Collector's Edition *Warhammer 40,000* Commander decks.


The *Secret Lair x Warhammer 40,000: Orks*, *Secret Lair x Warhammer Age of Sigmar*, and *Secret Lair x Blood Bowl* drops will also be impacted. We will follow up in the coming weeks with additional details on updated timing.
