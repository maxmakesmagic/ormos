It's Adventure Week here on **magicthegathering.com**, so strap on your [Adventuring Gear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adventuring+Gear) and get ready for a wild ride. This week I am proud to introduce a new Extended archetype that has the ability to win games on the first turn!

I was shuffling a random pile of cards at a friend's house last week when I saw a copy of [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach). I started asking around about [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) with [Protean Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk). [Carrion Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) is not legal in extended anymore so the [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) / [Body Double](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) loop just doesn't work. A few people suggested that I could use the [Protean Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk) trigger to fetch up a playset of [Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab)s along with a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and a playset of [Dryad Arbor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor). The idea sounded a bit silly, but I decided to throw together a list and see how things panned out.


I will start by explaining the combo:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Through the Breach | Protean Hulk |

Once you have assembled [Protean Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk) and [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) in your hand you cast the [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) and put the [Protean Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk) onto the battlefield. At the end of the turn you sacrifice the [Protean Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk). You search your library for four copies of [Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab), four copies of [Dryad Arbor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor), and one copy of [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). Each crab mills for three per land. The math works like this: 3 x 4 x 5 = 60. If you already drew combo pieces, it usually doesn't matter. If you draw [Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab) you can usually get a few mills out of it before your opponent decides to kill it. You also have an army of blockers post-combo that can usually buy you an extra turn to play a land and fully mill out an opponent if you had an awkward draw.

**[Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) and [Simian Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide):** Mana acceleration is very important. Turn four is the norm nowadays in Extended. We need cards like this to break serve. I won one of my first test games on turn two with a [Simian Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide) and [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song).


**[Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach):** A key combo piece.


**[Protean Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk):** I chose to play only two copies of the [Protean Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk). [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) seemed strictly superior to me because I could grab it with [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths).


**[Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths):** This is the best tutor available for a deck like this. [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) finds our mana acceleration, [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact)s, and [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach)es.

**[Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder):** I have a hard time not playing [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) in my blue combo decks.


**[Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder):** The most impressive Snake in the history of the game serves two purposes here: [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) accelerates our mana and acts as a combo piece.


**[Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab) and [Dryad Arbor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor):** The fruition of the combo.

Remember to mulligan aggressively with this one. You don't want too many [Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab)s or [Dryad Arbor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor)s in your opening hand.


People seemed pretty excited about the ticket count in my last column. This deck's count is a bit higher than last week's, but still significantly lower than most Extended decks. Here's what these rares were trading for as of this writing:

[Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach), 0.2 tickets each (4 copies) = 0.8 tickets  
[Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest), 3.2 tickets each (4 copies) =12.8 tickets  
[Shivan Reef](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), 0.5 tickets each (4 copies) =2 tickets  
[Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact), 6.5 tickets each (4 copies) =26 tickets


**Total cost of rares:** 42.6 tickets


I played the deck in a few heads-up tournaments online. I'd like to share some of my experiences with you.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab81_nacatl.jpg)I lost the roll, mulliganed down to five, and kept [Simian Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide), [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach), [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact), and [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). If I drew a land I could win on the second turn. My opponent played a fetch land into [Stomping Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground) and cast [Wild Nacatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl). I draw a [Telling Time](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telling+Time), play my [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and pass the turn. My opponent played a [Hallowed Fountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain), attacked for 3, and cast a [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). I drew a [Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab) and passed the turn. My opponent played another fetch land, attacked for 4, cast [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary), and passed the turn. I drew [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) and passed the turn. My opponent played another fetch land, aimed a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) at my face, and attacked for lethal damage. I posthumously drew a card and found the land I needed. Boo.

My opponent cycled a [Deadshot Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadshot+Minotaur) on my end step, and I figured I was playing against [Living End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End). My opponent played another land and passed the turn. I sacrificed my [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) on my opponent's end step to find an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island).

My opponent cast a cascade spell, spinning up [Living End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) as always, killing my [Dryad Arbor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) but bringing my [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and all his friends back to the battlefield. I drew a [Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab) for my turn, played my land, cast [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), cast [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) finding [Protean Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk), cast [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach), put [Protean Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk) onto the battlefield, and passed the turn. I was a bit short in the milling department, but I had plenty of chump-blockers for the next turn. My opponent attacked, and I blocked something to stay alive. I played a [Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab) and a land on my turn, and the game was over.

I played my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and cast [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), I saw nothing that resembled a [Protean Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk) or [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact), so I shuffled those three away and drew a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). My opponent played a [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and passed the turn. I cast another [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and again saw no Pacts or Hulks, so I shuffled and drew another [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach).

During my draw step, my opponent attempted to cast a [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique).

My opponent looked at my hand and let me keep it, and lost to milling on my end step.

My opponent cast a [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), removed a [Mistbind Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) as the imprint, played a land, and passed the turn. I popped the Expanse for an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). I drew another [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), played the first [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), saw a [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) and a [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact), and drew one and left the other on top. My opponent cast a [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) on my end step and took away my [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach). (It was replaced by the [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) on top of my deck.) My opponent played a fourth land and passed the turn. I drew a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played my land, and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Pestermite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) on my end step, and cast [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) in response. My opponent tapped me out with [Pestermite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), then untapped, cast [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker) and made about 30 hasty [Pestermite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite)s. Looks like I'm not the only combo deck.

I drew another [Simian Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide), played my [Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest), and passed the turn. My opponent suspended an [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) and passed the turn.

I drew a [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) for my turn. Played my third land, exiled both [Simian Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide)s, cast [Through the Breach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach), put [Protean Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk) onto the battlefield, etc. I milled my opponent out on turn three.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/2_1.jpg)  
The deck performed decently for me in further testing. It lacks the consistency to be a top-tier tournament deck, but it is certainly a lot of fun to play. The deck sometimes gets unbeatable draws. (I don't mean [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) into [Mistbind Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) unbeatable, I mean [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) into [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) into [Yawgmoth's Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Will) unbeatable.) If you're the type who likes to play mill decks, then I strongly recommend trying out this combo. It also seems like a good alternative for people who have been playing with [Hive Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Mind) this Extended season.


Happy brewin!
