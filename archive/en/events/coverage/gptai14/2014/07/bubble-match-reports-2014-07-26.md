While many players in the room have already secured seats in Day 2, some others aren't so lucky. In fact, many are struggling to win their bubble match so that they may return tomorrow. With over 800 players here at Taipei, only the Top 128 will advance.

Pro Tour Champion Mike Hron (left) is up against Charles Law from Singapore (right). Hron's deck looks like a monstrosity, laden with goodies such as [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster) and an assortment of removal spells, however it was Law's Red Green deck which prevailed, qualifying him for Day 2.

Former World Champion, Makihito Mihara (left), seems to be having a rather rough day despite having a powerful, but clunky, deck featuring [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess), [Burning Anger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Anger) and double [Covenant of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covenant+of+Blood). Unfortunately, he ended up losing the match and placing a heartbreaking 129th. Makihito Mihara would need to pick up his points at Pro Tour Portland.

3-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor Soh Weng Heng (left) was up against Imai Ayato (right) from Japan. Soh's consistent White Red aggro deck featuring a plethora of flyers and burn nabbed him the first game against Ayato's greedy 4-color deck. In the end, it was Soh who got to the finish line, making it through to Day 2.

Just a few tables down, Huang Hao-Shan (left) was paired, against fellow countryman Huang Youn Ming (right). Not wanting to leave anyone behind, both players decided to shake on it and take the draw to move into Day 2 with matching 6-2-1 records.



Similarly, Pro Tour Journey to Nyx Top 8 competitor Nam Sung Wook has decided to take a draw with Zheng Zuo to advance into Day 2 rather than risking elimination. Fellow Korean teammate and Grand Prix Minneapolis Champion, Park Jun Young, has also decided to ID with Adam Yen, ensuring that we'll have at least two Korean players tomorrow.

World *Magic* Cup Champion Kuo Tzu Ching (right) narrowly defeated Xiao Yong-Yu (left) to finish the day at 19 points. "I'm not even sure if I will make it though," he murmured, "my tiebreakers may not be high enough." Luckily, he managed to squeak in at 114th.

Over at table 43, Grand Prix Washington D.C. Top 4 competitor, Yam Wing Chun (right), was forced to play out the last match as well. His opponent's, Mak Wai Hou (left), tiebreakers would not allow them to Intentionally Draw. After two games, both players were tied at one a piece but Mak had already witnessed [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros), [Soul of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Zendikar) and [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) emerge from Yam's deck. Mak decided to gamble against his tiebreakers rather than gamble against Yam's bomb rares, any of which would likely spell doom for him. Thankfully, the gambit paid off and both players will be returning tomorrow.

Possibly the best pool of mythics and rares you could possibly open!
