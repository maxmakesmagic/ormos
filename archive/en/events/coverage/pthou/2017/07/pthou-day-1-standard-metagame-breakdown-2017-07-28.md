Together with the help of Marc Calderaro, we went through all decklists, categorizing every single competitor's weapon of choice into categories. With over 20 archetypes, this was an indication of an extremely diverse metagame. Let's take a look at what all our competitors brought to the tables!

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ramunap+Ruins)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramunap+Ruins) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sunscorched+Desert)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscorched+Desert)
Ramunap Red was the most popular strategy by far, occupying almost 25% of the metagame. It benefited greatly from the deserts in the *Amonkhet* block—namely [Ramunap Ruins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramunap+Ruins) and [Sunscorched Desert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscorched+Desert)—and some players even included a couple of [Dunes of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dunes+of+the+Dead) and [Endless Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Sands) in the mix. Having upwards of 20 damage incorporated into the mana base provided a lot of reach, and this was one of the key reasons the deck had been so successful in recent weeks.  
  
[Earthshaker Khenra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthshaker+Khenra) and [Ahn-Crop Crasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ahn-Crop+Crasher) punished opponents severely for holding back potentially-useless blockers, while the deck gains some long-term resilience thanks to [Earthshaker Khenra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthshaker+Khenra)'s eternalize ability, [Hazoret the Fervent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazoret+the+Fervent), and [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance) from the sideboard.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cryptbreaker)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptbreaker) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Relentless+Dead)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relentless+Dead)
The next most popular archetype was Mono-Black Zombies, a deck which Gerry Thompson took down Pro Tour *Amonkhet* with. Adding all mono black, blue-black and black-red versions together, it amounted to 63 players who chose to put their trust in [Cryptbreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptbreaker) and [Relentless Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relentless+Dead), along with all of their undead friends. Some versions splashed [The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God) for end-game resilience, as well as [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) to stop nasty spells, while one player chose to supplement his removal suite with [Abrade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrade) and [Cut // Ribbons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cut+%2F%2F+Ribbons)!


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Winding+Constrictor)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dreamstealer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamstealer)
Black-Green Constrictor was the third most dominant archetype, and the prospect of quick, clean kills with [Winding Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor) and [Rishkar, Peema Renegade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishkar%2C+Peema+Renegade) was still very alluring. [Dreamstealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamstealer) showed up in numerous lists, since the deck had no problem enhancing its power with [Blossoming Defense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blossoming+Defense), [Verdurous Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdurous+Gearhulk), and even Larger than Life!


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Heart+of+Kiran)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Kiran) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Toolcraft+Exemplar)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toolcraft+Exemplar) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Inventor%27s+Apprentice)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inventor%27s+Apprentice)
Mardu Vehicles remained strong, but dipped in popularity compared to the past few Pro Tours. The Planeswalker plan was threatened by the existence of [Hour of Devastation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hour+of+Devastation), so many players opted to adopt a more aggressive approach, which meant that [Inventor's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inventor%27s+Apprentice) was becoming more popular.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Torrential+Gearhulk)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk)
[Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk) decks were also well-represented, especially when [Abrade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrade), [Supreme Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Will) and [Hour of Devastation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hour+of+Devastation) provided so many new tools for the control players. [Nicol Bolas, God-Pharaoh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+God-Pharaoh) was also the win condition of choice in several lists. Regardless of whether players were playing Blue-Red Control, Blue-Black Control or Grixis Control, the core remained mostly similar.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hour+of+Promise)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hour+of+Promise) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger)
Moving down to sixth place were Red-Green ramp strategies as well as [God-Pharaoh's Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Pharaoh%27s+Gift) strategies. Big mana strategies made a resurgence, with Gifts of Paradise, [Weirding Wood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weirding+Wood), [Spring // Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spring+%2F%2F+Mind), or [Beneath the Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beneath+the+Sands). This enabled a turn-four [Hour of Promise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hour+of+Promise) (for two copies of [Shrine of the Forsaken Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+the+Forsaken+Gods)) to accelerate into turn-five [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger)! [God-Pharaoh's Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Pharaoh%27s+Gift) was immensely popular in the week leading into this weekend, but its popularity tapered down by Pro Tour time.

Just because a deck was not as well-represented doesn't mean we were going to leave it out of the metagame. Here is the exhaustive list of all decks with three or less copies. Some of these decks were rather innovative and interesting, and only time will tell how they fare against the pillars of the metagame!
