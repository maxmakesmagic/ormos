The semifinals of Grand Prix Sendai brought two Pro Tour champions to the table. Brian Kibler, winner of Pro Tour-Austin, sporting his Next Level Bant deck was forced to battle one-third of Pro Tour-Charleston Champion, former Player of the Year, and reigning ***Magic*** Online Player of the Year, Shota Yasooka sporting a Jund deck.


Both players decided to keep their opening hands, with the first play of the game being a [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger) for Kibler. Yasooka countered with a [Sprouting Thrinax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax). Kibler was able to land an [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant) the following turn, creating a chump blocker for Yasooka's Thrinax. Yasooka, without a fourth land, was only able to play a [Putrid Leech](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech).

Kibler played [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) and [Wall of Omens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens), creating another token, but an end-of-turn [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and follow-up [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning) from Yasooka took care of the Knight-Errant. Undeterred, Kibler was able to cast another Elspeth the following turn. Yasooka cast [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning), dropping Elspeth to two loyalty while allowing Kibler to discard a [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine). The following turn, a [Ranger of Eos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos) from Kibler allowed him to return [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine) from his graveyard, and, after giving it flying with Elspeth, Yasooka dropped to eleven life.


A [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) from Yasooka was able to take care of Kibler's second Elspeth. Kibler attacked with his [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine) allowing Yasooka to turn his Thrinax into three Saprolings, while Kibler played a post-combat [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), forcing all of Yasooka's creatures to attack it the following turn. After a forced suicide attack from Yasooka, a Seige-Gang Commander was put onto the battlefield by the former Player of the Year.


A [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) from Kibler took care of Yasooka's [Siege-Gang Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander), allowing Kibler to turn Gideon into a 6/6 and attack with his team. Yasooka blocked with his Goblins, dropping to two life. A [Sarkhan the Mad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+the+Mad) off the top for Yasooka turned his remaining Saproling token into a 5/5 Dragon, but the Dragonmaster himself was able to simply attack in with his team and take game one.

Game two got started with a turn one [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) for Kibler and a turn two [Putrid Leech](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech) for Yasooka. A [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge) from Kibler took care of Yasooka's Leech. In return, his post combat [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) was dealt with by a [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) from Yasooka.


Kibler's acceleration allowed him to play a turn three [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine), dropping Yasooka to fifteen. Yasooka's only response was a [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), creating a 3/3 Beast token, but an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) from Kibler on the token and attack from [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine) dealt with Wildspeaker. With no play from Yasooka, he fired up his [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) dropping Kibler to fifteen.


Another [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine) from Kibler allowed him continue the beats, while Yasooka did nothing. Another attack from Kibler elicited a [Bituminous Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bituminous+Blast), cascading into a [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker). After combat, Kibler cast a [Sphinx of Lost Truths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Lost+Truths) and a Noble Hiearch, allowing Kibler to bring back the recently blasted [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine).


Yasooka's draw allowed him to cast a [Siege-Gang Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander) and a [Pithing Needle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle), while keeping two lands up thanks to Garruk. Despite this, with Yasooka at only three life, Kibler's Sphinx was enough to take the match.
