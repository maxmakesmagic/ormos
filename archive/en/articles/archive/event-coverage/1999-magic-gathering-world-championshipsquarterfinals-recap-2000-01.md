In the quarterfinals of the 1999 Magic: The Gathering World Championships, 1997 World Champ Jakub Slemr faced 1998 US Champion Matt Linde.


Slemr, who hails from the Czech Republic, was playing a Black Control deck with several discard spsells, as well as Powder Keg and Yawgmoth's Will for card economy. Linde was playing a mono-green swarm deck with 26 creatures plus four Urza's Legacy Creature-Lands.

On the second Quarterfinal table, Canada's Gary Wise faced Mark Le Pine of the US. Wise was playing the Black Control decks, and Le Pine was playing Sped Red, a Sligh deck with a heavy Land Destruction focus.


In the first game, Le Pine started off strong, getting Wise down to four life with early Mogg Fanatics and Avalanche Riders. Wise soon stabilized the board with a Cursed Scroll, however, and managed to finish Le Pine off with a Phyrexian Plaguelord and a Phyrexian Negator.
