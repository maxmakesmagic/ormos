**Card of the Day - vendredi 30 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Spectral%20Searchlight)#### Spectral Searchlight


 *Ravnica* uncommon. This versatile card was actually inspired by a submission from one of the readers for You Make the Card 2. In addition to fixing your own mana this also offers help to your teammates, and it can even switch over to offense when you don't need it by putting mana into your opponent's mana pool at times when they might not be able to use it! 


 **Card of the Day - jeudi 29 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Golgari%20Brownscale)#### Golgari Brownscale


 *Ravnica* common. There are many firsts with this new set. Golgari Brownscale is the first card to have a trigger based on going from your graveyard to your hand. 


 **Card of the Day - mercredi 28 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Farseek)#### Farseek


 *Ravnica* common. In a world like Ravnica, mana fixing is obviously crucial. The challenge for the design team with this one was that they wanted a card which could take advantage of the new dual lands, but which didn't strictly obsolete Rampant Growth. To accomplish both, Farseek was worded to get any land type other than forest, but note that it can still search out any of the new dual lands that is also a Forest. 


 **Card of the Day - mardi 27 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vedalken%20Entrancer)#### Vedalken Entrancer


 *Ravnica* common. This card underwent quite a bit of change during development. The original version from the design team actually milled four cards per activation, but that proved ridiculous for Limited play. The ability was moved to three but still turned out to be problematic, so the final version ended up at two. Even at half the power of its original version, we think you'll still find this plenty reasonable for Limited formats. 


 **Card of the Day - lundi 26 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Circu,%20Dimir%20Lobotomist)#### Circu, Dimir Lobotomist


 *Ravnica* rare. This is the first **Magic**  card to ever feature the phrase "target library." In fact, the comprehensive rules were changed to allow this phrase, as previously libraries couldn't be targeted by spells. The main reason? It was the only way to template Circu's abilities that would fit on the card! 


 **Card of the Day - vendredi 23 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hunted%20Wumpus)#### Hunted Wumpus


 *Mercadian Masques* uncommon. Though it's easy to miss at card size, the background to the Mercadian Masques piece shows a hunter's silhouette gesturing to fellow hunters as they chase the Wumpus in the foreground. (Click here for a large version of the MM Hunted Wumpus.) 


 **Card of the Day - jeudi 22 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Safe%20Haven)#### Safe Haven


 *The Dark* rare. In **Magic**'s earliest days land cards were often printed that had nothing at all to do with mana production. Despite *The Dark's*  small size, it contained three different non-mana related cards (the others are Maze of Ith and Sorrow's Path). Later in the game's history R&D clearly defined lands as cards specifically relating to the production of mana, though they can have other abilities as well. 


 **Card of the Day - mercredi 21 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Birds%20of%20Paradise)#### Birds of Paradise


 *Alpha* rare.  
The Birds have been one of the staples of the game since it began, but they were created as an afterthought. Their art was originally supposed to be for Tropical Island, but the bird was too prominent. So Richard Garfield created a card just for the art, and it ended up being the most versatile mana-producing creature ever. 


 **Card of the Day - mardi 20 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wildfire%20Emissary)#### Wildfire Emissary


 *Mirage* uncommon. Red and blue are tied for the most Efreet cards in **Magic** at five apiece (plus Frenetic Efreet, which is both colors). At a time when much (if not most) popular spot creature removal was either white or involved 3 damage, this efreet enjoyed quite a bit of play in many different decks. 


 **Card of the Day - lundi 19 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Corrupt)#### Corrupt


 *Urza's Saga* common. Black is the only color with such a core philosophy of trying to get you to play more and more of the color to the exclusion of other colors. Often that commitment shows up in mana requirements, such as Drain Life's cost or Frozen Shade's ability, where more black mana means more power. But a related family of black cards rewards you for having more swamps rather than just having more black mana. (Some other examples are Nightmare, Dakmor Sorceress, Infernal Harvest, and Mutilate.) 


 **Card of the Day - vendredi 16 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Demonic%20Hordes)#### Demonic Hordes

 Alpha rare. Though it's a subtle difference, this is a departure from the most common execution of a drawback if the controller doesn't meet a requirement. On most cards, the controller knows exactly what bad thing will happen to them if they don't meet the card's requirement, but in this case there is an uncertainty factor since the opponent gets to choose which land is sacrificed. 


 **Card of the Day - jeudi 15 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bounty%20of%20the%20Hunt)#### Bounty of the Hunt


 *Alliances* uncommon. The reason this card used temporary +1/+1 counters was to get around a templating problem **Magic** used to have. Originally, a spell with multiple targets couldn’t target the same target more than once, which caused problems with how the designers wanted this card to work. To get around the problem counters were used for this card. (This kind of problem was one of the reasons the targeting rules were changed with *Champions of Kamigawa*.) 


 **Card of the Day - mercredi 14 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Torment)#### Torment



*Stronghold* common. In addition to Torment, there are four other **Magic** cards which share an exact name with a **Magic** set. (Remember, only exact names, so something like Lingering Mirage wouldn't count for *Mirage* since there are extra words in that card's name.) How many others can you come up with? When you're ready, click here to reveal the answer. *Visions*  
*Prophecy*  
*Apocalypse*  
*Onslaught* 


 **Card of the Day - mardi 13 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Arrest)#### Arrest


 *Mercadian Masques* common. Though white excels at destroying mass amounts of creatures (with spells like Wrath of God), it hasn't had much of a tourney-level removal spell for individual creatures since Swords to Plowshares. Arrest and Pacifism have been taking turns over many of the game's blocks as something of an answer to individual creatures, and both are excellent in Limited formats, but neither has made much of a jump to Standard tournaments. 


 **Card of the Day - lundi 12 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Death-Mask%20Duplicant)#### Death-Mask Duplicant


 *Darksteel* uncommon. Though this particular one hasn’t caused too much trouble, Shapeshifters as a group have probably caused more rules headaches than just about any other creature type, particularly if you include honorary Shapeshifter Vesuvan Doppleganger. (Some readers will surely bring up the Licids, but Wizards of the Coast’s rules gurus will neither confirm nor deny that such creatures ever actually existed.) 


 **Card of the Day - vendredi 9 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dark%20Heart%20of%20the%20Wood)#### Dark Heart of the Wood


 *The Dark* common. The second set to feature gold cards (after *Legends*), *The Dark* was the first set to have a gold card that wasn't a creature. 


 **Card of the Day - jeudi 8 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Feldon's%20Cane)#### Feldon's Cane


 *Antiquities* uncommon. Because of the way the *Antiquities* version was templated, Feldon's Cane was reusable! The remove-from-game effect wasn't part of the cost, so the effect could be announced and then its user could destroy it in response with an instant-speed effect. The Cane would then be destroyed, the remove-from-game effect would fail to find the Cane, and the graveyard would be shuffled back into the deck with the Cane in it! (Later versions of the card corrected this templating problem.) 


 **Card of the Day - mercredi 7 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Decimate)#### Decimate


 *Odyssey* rare. Decimate features an interesting twist on the old formula of giving extra power to a card by adding a compensating drawback. In this case, the extra power *is* the drawback, as Decimate can only be cast when all the required targets are in play. 


 **Card of the Day - mardi 6 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Psionic%20Blast)#### Psionic Blast


 *Unlimited* uncommon. Mark Rosewater has been trying to get a new version of this card into the game for even more sets than he can remember. The challenge is that the ability is out of flavor for blue. Generally speaking, one way to deal with that is by adding enough of a drawback that it's not out of place on a non-red card. (Though it does have a drawback, as printed, Psionic Blast is way too powerful.) 


 **Card of the Day - vendredi 2 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Peacekeeper)#### Peacekeeper


 *Weatherlight* rare. In the flavor text to this card, Sisay, Captain of the Weatherlight, references her mother, who is pictured in the card's art. Sisay's mother makes a return appearance in the flavor text of Archangel. 


 **Card of the Day - jeudi 1 septembre 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bribery)#### Bribery


 *Mercadian Masques* rare. This card was originally slated for *Urza's Destiny*, but R&D didn't like that its effect was so similar to Treachery. Because of this, it was decided that Treachery would stay in *Destiny*  since it had the free spell mechanic, and Bribery was pushed off to *Mercadian Masques*.
