Swedes Sweep Grand Prix Utrecht!
================================

Grand Prix Utrecht 2013
-----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gputr13/winning-team.jpg)Over 2,000 players descended on Utrecht in the Netherlands to play *Gatecrash* team limited, but of all the contingents of players that rocked up for team sealed and team draft, it was the Swedish contingent that most completely dominated the field as team on team competition whittled us down to an all Swedish finals.


Joel Larsson was chasing Pro Points wherever he could after a second place finish at Pro Tour *Gatecrash*, and teamed up with Elias Watsfeldt and Mikael Magnusson to do so. Throughout the Swiss portion of the competition, they received only two losses in total â€“ to another all Swedish team of Jonathan Bergstrom, Tomas Westling and Fredrik Carlsson. That set up for an epic final where the two teams (being supervised by a Swedish judge and various Swedish fans) witnessed a tour de force from both teams.


It seemed that Bergstrom, Westling and Carlsson had the measure of their countrymen, powering through in successive rounds to take home the trophies as Grand Prix Utrecht champions!


It has been quite the weekend here in the Netherlands, and we hope that you've enjoyed watching along as much as we've enjoyed bringing you the stories from *Gatecrash* team limited. We hope that you'll join us again soon for the climax to the online season, with the **Magic Online** Championship Series finals, from PAX East.
