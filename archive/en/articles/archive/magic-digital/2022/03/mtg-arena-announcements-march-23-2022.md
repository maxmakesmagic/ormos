State of the Game—*Alchemy: Kamigawa*
=====================================


Last week, Jay Parker and Megan O'Malley gave us a look at the new 30-card set, improvements coming to *MTG Arena*, and lots more. In case you missed it, check out the [*Alchemy: Kamigawa* State of the Game article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-alchemy-kamigawa-2022-03-16).


*Alchemy: Kamigawa* Packs and Bundles Available Now
===================================================

*Alchemy: Kamigawa* packs and bundles can be purchased now in the *MTG Arena* Store!


* 1x *Alchemy: Kamigawa* pack for 1,000 gold
* 15x *Alchemy: Kamigawa* packs for 3,000 gems

Also, look for new bundles like the Tamiyo Compleat Bundle, Koi Pet Bundle, Spirited Companion Bundle, and several depth-art bundles.


**Special one-time purchase beginning March 31**: look for a 20-pack *Alchemy: Kamigawa* bundle for 15,000 gold or 3,000 gems! This will give you a boost as you add *Alchemy: Kamigawa* cards to your collection. But note! The *Alchemy: Kamigawa* 20-pack bundle will replace the special 20-pack *Alchemy: Innistrad* bundle, so if you haven't purchased that one but want to, do so soon, because it disappears on March 31!


[Check out the new *Alchemy: Kamigawa* cards](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/alchemy-kamigawa) and start adding them to your collection!


Upcoming Alchemy Balance Changes
================================


As part of the April 7 game update, we are planning to rebalance a number of cards in Alchemy. Since this is very close to a Qualifier Weekend, we wanted to give players as much notice as possible, with our goal to have the changes finalized and announced next week, though they will not be playable until the update is live.


Out of the Shadows Begins This Friday!
======================================


The [Out of the Shadows event](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/ninja-card-styles-leap-out-shadows-2022-03-02) kicks off Friday, March 25, with opportunities to add Ninja card styles to your collection like these:

Enter the streets of Towashi in this new event, using the Out of the Shadows emblem with the text:


Whenever one or more creatures you control deal combat damage to a player, a random creature card in your hand perpetually gets +1/+1. Until your next turn, you may cast creature spells as though they had flash.


Check out [complete event details and a list of the card styles you can win](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/ninja-card-styles-leap-out-shadows-2022-03-02), and start playing, because Out of the Shadows ends on April 1!
