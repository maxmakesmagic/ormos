Not yet 18 years old, Soh was the R&D pick to attend this event after garnering attention this past year with a couple of Top 8s that were credited to his massive ***Magic**  Online* experience.


The Malaysian wunderkind was near the top of the standings all week and started to pull away from the pack on Thursday with a 5-1 record in the Constructed formats. Terry put in work on every format before the event and was well-prepared throughout the week. The reward for his preparation will be a chance to design a card bearing his likeness in an upcoming expansion. Look for Jin, the Master of Disruption sometime next year -- and look out for Terry Soh at the next Pro Tour.


The Invitational is Magic's all-star game, and all the stars came out to shine this week including past Invitational winners Kai Budde and Bob Maher â€“ two players with more than a combined $500,000 in winnings. Among the many highlights of the week was the unveiling of Bob's card, the product of his 2004 Invitational victory -- Dark Confidant, a 2/1 black wizard for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) with a particularly dangerous ability, will be featured in *Ravnica* later this year.
