![Zhang Liao, Hero of Hefei](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zhang+Liao%2C+Hero+of+Hefei)**[Zhang Liao, Hero of Hefei](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zhang+Liao%2C+Hero+of+Hefei)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms*. Like a lot of the cards from this set, this one is based in reality. The real-world [Zhang Liao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Liao) was a great general serving under Warlord [Cao Cao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Cao) (who also has a [**Magic** card](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magic+card)). General Zhang defended the [Hefei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hefei) fortress from a rival warlord, thus the "hero" moniker on his card. 
 


![Tahngarth, Talruum Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tahngarth%2C+Talruum+Hero)**[Tahngarth, Talruum Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tahngarth%2C+Talruum+Hero)** – *Planeshift*. Tahngarth had plenty to do in the *Weatherlight* saga, but, wow, did he have a lot more to *say* about it! Sure, he has [his own card](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=his+own+card), plus his [anger issues](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=anger+issues) and [angry face](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=angry+face) are represented, but with [twenty-six cards of flavor text attributed to him](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&flavor=+%5BTahngarth%5D), he was also quite the talker! 
 


![Stonebrow, Krosan Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stonebrow%2C+Krosan+Hero)**[Stonebrow, Krosan Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonebrow%2C+Krosan+Hero)** – *Time Spiral*. Most cards from *Time Spiral* pay homage to earlier ones. In this case, [Stonebrow, Krosan Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonebrow%2C+Krosan+Hero)'s abilities come down from [Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Fist+of+Krosa). The two characters are connected by story as well, not least of which in the axe named Soul Reaper that Stonebrow wields—it's the same one Kamahl used to create the false god, [Karona](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karona)! Read more about Stonebrow and all the [legends of *Time Spiral* in this feature](/en/articles/archive/legends-time-spiral-2006-11-13). 
 


![Brigid, Hero of Kinsbaile ](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Brigid%2C+Hero+of+Kinsbaile+)**[Brigid, Hero of Kinsbaile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brigid%2C+Hero+of+Kinsbaile+)**  – *Lorwyn*. As is appropriate for a set inspired by Celtic and British folklore, the name [Brigid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigid) comes from the Celtic religion, and one of her symbols was an arrow. Neat! While **Magic**'s Brigid isn't a [God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22God%22%5D), as a [Kithkin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&page=0&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Kithkin%22%5D) she represents a much older creature type. Yes, the Kithkins really exploded onto the scene during [*Lorwyn-Shadowmoor* block](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Kithkin%22%5D&format=+%5B%22Lorwyn-Shadowmoor%20Block%22%5D), and were pretty well represented during the [*Time Spiral* block](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Kithkin%22%5D&format=+%5B%22Time+Spiral+Block%22%5D), but the first Kithkin came from *Legends*: [Amrou Kithkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1601). 
 


![Anthousa, Setessan Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Anthousa%2C+Setessan+Hero)**[Anthousa, Setessan Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anthousa%2C+Setessan+Hero)** – *Theros*. Setessa is a polis composed primarily of women and children, and according to the [second Planeswalker's Guide to Theros](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/262c), "children of Setessa are called *arkulli* ("little bears")." In **Magic** slang, a 2/2 creature (for two mana) is known as a "Bear" (thanks to [Grizzly Bears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=155)). Anthousa makes 2/2 creatures. Hmm… coincidence? 
 
![Jeleva, Nephalia's Scourge](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/6542kYJTLc_EN.jpg)  
Jeleva, Nephalia's Scourge – *Commander* (2013 Edition). Back before [Avacyn, Angel of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Avacyn%252C%2BAngel%2Bof%2BHope) was restored (yay [Avacyn, Angel of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Avacyn%252C%2BAngel%2Bof%2BHope)!), the good folk of Nephalia [often served as lunch](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/165) for the not-so-good folk of Nephalia. Even today, after the [Helvault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helvault) was opened, Jeleva remains a constant threat to the province.

![Prossh, Skyraider of Kher](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/KVpEYaZkC3_EN.jpg)  
Prossh, Skyraider of Kher – *Commander* (2013 Edition). The last time we saw Kher was its [Scourge in *Future Sight*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+in+Future+Sight), and before that its [Keep in *Time Spiral*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keep+in+Time+Spiral). *Legends* gave us [a pair of Kher Kobolds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&name=+%5BKher%5D&set=+%5B%22Legends%22%5D), but Kher was introduced with Alpha's [Roc of Kher Ridges](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=218).

![Oloro, Ageless Ascetic](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/hbwwmx6q1F_EN.jpg)  
Oloro, Ageless Ascetic – *Commander* (2013 Edition). A month or so ago, **Magic** player and all-around cool guy [Chris Kluwe](https://twitter.com/ChrisWarcraft) dropped by the office to play *Commander* (2013 Edition). We then asked him to [reveal Oloro on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisWarcraft/statuses/387243828383465472) for us last week. Fun!

![Derevi, Empyrial Tactician](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/rDas0lTAPg_EN.jpg)  
Derevi, Empyrial Tactician – *Commander* (2013 Edition). Derevi isn't the first Empyrial [something] in **Magic**, nor is she even the first Empyrial "Bant" (green, white, blue) card. That distinction goes to [Empyrial Archangel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empyrial+Archangel), from *Shards of Alara*.

![Marath, Will of the Wild](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/0lpCxGONoP_EN.png)  
Marath, Will of the Wild – *Commander* (2013 Edition). FYI, [Marath has errata](/en/node/650231). "X can't be 0" was left off the card, so his second ability should read: 


 X, Remove X +1/+1 counters from Marath: Choose one — Put X +1/+1 counters on target creature; or Marath deals X damage to target creature or player; or put an X/X green Elemental creature token onto the battlefield. X can't be 0. 





![Karametra's Acolyte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte)**[Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte)** – *Theros*. For as long as it has existed, the word "acolyte" has meant "follower; attendant." And the word has existed for quite some time! It came to us from Ancient Greek (and probably before that from [Proto-Indo-European](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language)), combining the *a-* prefix ("together with") with *kolouthos* ("road"). Okay, swell, but who is Karametra, then? Well… that will be revealed in the future. 
 


![Arena Athlete](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arena+Athlete)**[Arena Athlete](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena+Athlete)** – *Theros*. The word "arena"... isn't Greek. Surprise! It's from Latin (and maybe from Etruscan before that), where it meant "a sand-strewn place of combat" (the sand was to soak up blood). Interestingly, while English took the word for its place meaning, [Italian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=374830) and [Spanish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=376075) adopted the sandy part, where *arena* means "sand." Oh, but don't worry, in keeping with the theme, "athlete" *is* Greek and has meant "someone who competes" pretty much since it was coined. 
 


![Returned Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Returned+Centaur)**[Returned Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Centaur)** – *Theros*. As you probably already know, "centaur" comes to us from Greek—specifically, *kentauros*. But etymologists shrug and mumble a bit when asked where the Greeks came up with the word; maybe it's from a [Thessalian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Thessaly) tribe of bull fighters (*kenteo* is "fight;" *tauros* is "bull") who... didn't have horse bodies. [That's its own topic, though!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur#Theories_of_origin) The "turn" of "Returned" also comes to us ultimately from Greek, although it might have its roots in Proto-Indo-European (aka [PIE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language)). 
 


![Horizon Scholar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Horizon+Scholar)**[Horizon Scholar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Scholar)** – *Theros*. Okay, yes, [the riddle of the sphinx](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=%20http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx#The_Riddle_of_the_Sphinx) is Greek, but this week is about words, not myths. (Spoilers!) English got the word "horizon" from French, which got it from Latin, which… yup… got it from Greek—in this case, *horizon kyklos* ("bounding circle"), ultimately from *horos* ("boundary"). And "scholar" *also* comes to us from the Greek *skhole* (by way of Latin), which meant "leisure, idleness, or learned discussion." Such a Greeky card! 
 


![Evangel of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Evangel+of+Heliod)**[Evangel of Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evangel+of+Heliod)** – *Theros*. The word "evangel" comes to English from French, which got it from Late Latin. As you might have guessed, since we're talking about Theros, it originated in Greece as *euangelion* ("good tidings"). It derives from the Greek *angelos* ("messenger"), which in turn is a translation of a Hebrew word possibly borrowed from… Persian? Whew! At any rate, it's quite an old word! 
 


![Akroan Horse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Akroan+Horse)**[Akroan Horse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Horse)** – *Theros*. The famous finale to the long Trojan War came in the form of a large wooden horse. The [Trojan Horse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Horse) story is known to us mainly through the Latin poet Virgil's story, [*Aeneid*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid), although it is mentioned in Homer's [*Odyssey*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odyssey) (the events having occurred after [*Iliad*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad)). 
 


![Fleshmad Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fleshmad+Steed)**[Fleshmad Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshmad+Steed)** – *Theros*. The demigod Herakles (Latinized as Hercules), yet another son of Zeus, went mad at one point and killed his sons. Once he regained his sanity, he served penance by performing twelve labors for King Eurystheus. One of these [dodekathlon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labours_of_Hercules) (twelve labors), was to steal flesh-eating horses known as the [Mares of Diomedes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mares_of_Diomedes). 
 


![Fleetfeather Sandals](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fleetfeather+Sandals)**[Fleetfeather Sandals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleetfeather+Sandals)** – *Theros*. Among other things, Hermes was messenger of the gods in Greek mythology, and although he was probably pretty fast on his own, he wore a pair of [winged sandals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talaria)—gifts from his father, Zeus—that made him even faster. 
 


![Curse of the Swine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Curse+of+the+Swine)**[Curse of the Swine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+the+Swine)** – *Theros*. In Homer's [*Odyssey*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odyssey), Odysseus and his men land on an island controlled by the witch-goddess Circe, who promptly turns many of them into pigs. In return for a year of Odysseus's affection, she returns them to human and later aids them with information.
