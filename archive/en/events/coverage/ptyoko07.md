After a grueling four-game control-on-control final, Guillaume Wafo-Tapa of France emerged as the winner of Pro Tour-Yokohama. Already renowned as a deck designer, Wafo-Tapa scored the big trophy in his first Sunday appearance at a Pro Tour - certainly ending any anonymity Wafo-Tapa may have previously held.


Pro Tour champion is an impressive title, especially when you consider Wafo-Tapa accomplished the feat against one of the most fearsome Top 8s ever assembled. To get to his showdown with Japan's Kazuya Mitamura in the finals, Wafo-Tapa first had to defeat Worlds Top 8 member Paulo Carvalho and Pro Tour-Honolulu champion Mark Herberholz. Mitamura's road was not any easier, taking down reigning Rookie of the Year Sebastian Thaler and Pro Tour-Charleston champion Tomoharu Saito to make the finals.


Ridiculous haymakers filled the final match, with [Draining Whelk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draining+Whelk)s and Teferis flying across the table. Mitamura took one game with the "Pickles" combo of [Brine Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brine+Elemental) and [Vesuvan Shapeshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuvan+Shapeshifter), but ultimately, Wafo-Tapa's choice to play cards with as much raw power as possible paid off. After navigating a Top 8 filled with big monsters and bigger names, Guillaume Wafo-Tapa emerged as the champion of Pro Tour-Yokohama!
