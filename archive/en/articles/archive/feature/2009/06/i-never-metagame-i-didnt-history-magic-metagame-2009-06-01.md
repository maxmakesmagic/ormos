Considered the first real archetype in competitive **Magic**, the "Weissman Deck" was a take-on-all-comers control deck that used all the early power cards. Weissman understood that the strength of broken cards like [Mind Twist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Twist) lay in their ability to dominate an opponent's resources. One Twist destroyed numerous cards. One [Moat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moat) neutralized an entire ground offensive. This principle, now called card advantage, has influenced tournament-caliber strategies ever since. 

### Standard Enters a Vise Age

![Black Vise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Black+Vise)As major events moved from the broad Type I (Classic) format to the more "even" Type II (Standard) playing field, broken cards continued to dictate top tables in every arena. The 1995 U.S. Nationals and World Championships divided Standard into two kinds of predominantly black decks: one with four [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach)s and the other with four [Black Vise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Vise)s. These two strategies held widely different surface goals (one encouraging high hands, the other low), but had one common ability: both were incredibly quick. 

Players of the stock-discard deck (usually mono-black) could cast [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) and [Hypnotic Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypnotic+Specter) on the first turn, follow that up with [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) or some fast creature on the second turn, and then be shuffling for the next game—victorious—in the blink of an eye. 

[Black Vise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Vise), which Chris Pikula once called "Three Free Bolts," is the most efficient turn-one damage source in **Magic** history. Henry Stern's "Vise Age" deck abused an early Vise by backing it up with multiple [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine)s. The Mines counteracted the power of discard, kept opponents in Vise damage range, and gave the "Vise Age" player a constant supply of fire to use on attacking creatures and unfortunate opponents. 

Knowing these decks defined the environment, Mark Justice played the metagame to win the 1995 National title. Justice pummeled mono-black decks with his hard-to-kill (and increasingly dangerous) [Whirling Dervish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirling+Dervish)es. He used the [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine)s from "Vise Age" to power his own Black Vises and keep his own hand full of direct damage. By playing neither of the standard strategies, Justice ended up besting both. 

### [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Necropotence) Summer

![Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Necropotence)The Standard environment changed radically with the restriction of [Black Vise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Vise). Players were no longer hampered by small hand sizes, so [Land Tax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land+Tax) and [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) were able to turn card advantage, rather than speed, into a defining force. While top-decking the broken [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance) could still dominate a game, more consistent strategies, like playing an [Erhnam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erhnam+Djinn) and protecting it with [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon), or establishing the [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) / [Drain Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life) engine to outdraw an opponent, were becoming common. 

This change allowed Mike Loconto to win the first-ever Pro Tour event with a slow blue/white deck. Ironically, the subsequent tournament environment was defined by the deck that didn't win. 

With an offense of Knights and [Hypnotic Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypnotic+Specter)s, Leon Lindbäch's deck was reminiscent of the old discard decks. However, he added four [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence)s, ushering in a new age of the **Magic** metagame. By June of 1996, Standard was plunged into the "Black Summer." Every player who wanted to win either used multiple [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence)s, or played a deck that could defeat the power of [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Necropotence). 

The drawing power of [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence+) and [Drain Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life+) combined with the sheer card domination of four [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach)s and four [Strip Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strip+Mine)s to dominate most tournaments. Most players found it impossible to deal with the pure speed of the [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dark%2BRitual) / Specter / Knight offense that [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Necropotence)decks inherited from their discard ancestry. Tom Chanpheng had to play twelve main-deck, protection-from-black creatures to wrest the 1996 World title away from hordes of [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Necropotence)decks—another perfect example of addressing the metagame. 

### A Slightly Different Strategy

![Ball Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ball+Lightning)By spring of 1997, the Standard Restricted List included [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach+) and [Strip Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strip+Mine). The colors were now more-or-less balanced (between black and white anyway), and two strong decks emerged during the Qualifiers for Pro Tour-Paris: [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) variants and control variants. While hampered with an overall weaker card base, the new [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Necropotence)decks still commanded the most powerful card-drawing engine in the game. However, the blue/white decks enjoyed a renaissance of viability, using the *Mirage* Tutors to fetch restricted cards and broken combinations, such as [Land Tax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land+Tax) / [Zuran Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zuran+Orb) or [Zuran Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zuran+Orb) / [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance). 

And yet, it was during these Paris Qualifiers that a little-known player from Ithaca, New York, used the scoffed-at "Sligh" deck to best both strategies and put a third major archetype on the **Magic** map. With an unending supply of direct damage, David Price burned the life-chained [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) players into the ground while his weenie horde crushed the control decks. With [Ball Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning), Price's deck dealt a lot of damage ... and it still does. 

At the 1997 Nationals, David Price became a **Magic** legend with his modified "Sligh" deck, called "Deadguy Red." Assuming most players would run blue/white decks (with four slow [Thawing Glaciers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thawing+Glaciers)) or self-destructive [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Necropotence)decks (now lacking [Ivory Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Tower) and [Zuran Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zuran+Orb)), Price created an all-out assault deck with burn, [Ball Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning)s, and [Lava Hounds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Hounds). Price ran over players who tapped out with their [Thawing Glaciers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thawing+Glaciers) and sent the death-drawers to an even earlier grave. Although he had no chance at making Day 3 due to a dismal draft record, Price went a perfect 6-0 in Standard and earned the names "Dream Crusher" and "King of Beatdown." 

### The Present and Future Kings

![Cursed Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cursed+Scroll)A year after Price put red back on the map, Standard is still divided into three camps: "Deadguy Red" ("Sligh"), "Cuneo Blue" (control), and black/green "Nightmare Survival" (black card advantage). 

"Deadguy Red" retains its ties to Price's beatdown deck from the 1997 Nationals, relying on [Ball Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning) and [Fireblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireblast) to deal tons of damage. However, it's now even more consistent with its powerful one-mana creatures and [Cursed Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll). 

"[Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) Survival" seems the perfect foil for "Deadguy Red"; with Walls and annoying Spikes, it slows down an offensive deck long enough to win via a huge creature or forces a concession through the ultimate card advantage scheme: recursion. 

To complete the triangle, "Cuneo Blue" controls black/green. Its permission base deters expensive graveyard recursion and gains control with [Nevinyrral's Disk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nevinyrral%27s+Disk) and [Whispers of the Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispers+of+the+Muse). Unfortunately, a first-turn [Jackal Pup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup) is often the harbinger of a fiery doom. 

The removal of the *Mirage* block—particularly the *Visions* power set—is sure to shake up the metagame. Old archetypes will undoubtedly be weakened while upcoming sets give birth to new ones. The result? A new balance of power in the environment, a new chapter for the ever-evolving tournament metagame.
