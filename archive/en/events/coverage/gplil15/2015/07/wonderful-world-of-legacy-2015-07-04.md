Earlier in the day I posted a series of basic primers on some of the decks we expected to see at the Grand Prix today.



Unsurprisingly, I've seen a lot of Islands on my wanders through the hall. So many that some players have tried to take advantage by playing main deck hate cards such as [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast) and [Choke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choke). This strategy has not worked out for some. I overheard one player bemoaning a sequence of opponents not featuring a single Island in either its basic or dual-land guise.



"Goblins, Artifacts, Elves …"



That's the thing with a format as diverse as Legacy. It might look like wall-to-wall [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), and various flavors of Island plus other land type, but it's not actually wall-to-wall [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), and various flavors of Island. That main deck [Choke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choke) can end up looking pretty silly when you're being squished by a massive [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine).



As I walked around, I grabbed a few snapshots of some of the more unusual decks.

Remember [Time Spiral](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Spiral)? Not the set—the card.



At various times in Magic's history [High Tide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide), a deck based around an innocuous Fallen Empires instant, was a much-feared deck. It still lives on in Legacy. [High Tide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide) to boost the mana production of Islands plus ways to untap and retap those islands (for example [Candelabra of Tawnos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Candelabra+of+Tawnos), [Time Spiral](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Spiral)) is an old way to generate tons of mana.

I'm not sure what the Legacy Enchantress deck looks like, but a board of [Argothian Enchantress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argothian+Enchantress) followed by [Enchantress's Presence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enchantress%27s+Presence) is usually an omen of bad things to come.



In an early round I saw a deck that looked like Lands, except it was merrily attacking away with [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster). Not many Islands to [Choke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choke) there either.

Later on I saw a more conventional interpretation of Goblins. I'm assuming the player had a fun game. [Warren Instigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warren+Instigator) putting [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker) onto the battlefield with [Goblin Ringleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Ringleader) and [Goblin Matron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Matron) is all fun and games until the opponent gets buried in Goblins. (It's still fun and games for the Goblin player …)



(Main deck [Choke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choke) isn't too good here either.)



All these old cards, especially in languages players may not be familiar with, can be difficult to keep track of. I saw one player helpfully show his opponent a binder full of [Cavern Harpy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+Harpy) in various languages after being asked what this strange card did. Your definition of helpful might vary considering the same player had an [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) in play at the time …



Everyone has to start somewhere but when I saw someone pick up a [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) to read in round two my first thought was: Oof, you're going to have a long day.



While walking round I did pass a game at the perfect time to see an amusing Oops! moment. Both players had blue dual lands in play. One cast [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) and put the last remaining card from his hand card face down on the table. His opponent did the same with a card from his hand. The first player turned up [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience). His opponent flipped up [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn).



Oops indeed. Sometimes [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) is a perfectly fair card, after all.



That would have been a perfect moment to take a picture … if I'd had the camera on me.



So I guess that oops goes for me too.
