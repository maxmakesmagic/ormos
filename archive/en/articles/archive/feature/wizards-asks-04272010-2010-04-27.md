*Have any good Eldrazi "war stories" from Prereleases and Launch Parties?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** I don't think there's ever been a Limited format this deserving of the word "epic." I have seen [Kozilek, Butcher of Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+Butcher+of+Truth) trade in combat with a [Venerated Teacher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerated+Teacher) enchanted with [Eldrazi Conscription](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Conscription). I have already achieved my dream of the turn-three [Hand of Emrakul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hand+of+Emrakul). A friend of mine even hardcast [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn), although unfortunately she didn't get to take her extra turn—because she gave [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) haste with [Battle Rampart](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Rampart)!

My favorite one so far, though, is one I already mentioned on Twitter (@[dailymtg](http://twitter.com/dailymtg)). It's my opponent's turn five at the Prerelease, and he has already played his fifth land. He has four Eldrazi Spawn thanks to two [Brood Birthing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brood+Birthing)s, and last turn he cast [Pawn of Ulamog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pawn+of+Ulamog). I have a freshly cast [Ondu Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ondu+Giant). My opponent attacks with his 2/2 [Pawn of Ulamog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pawn+of+Ulamog) into my 2/4 Giant.

Now, I have some inkling of what's about to happen—call it a sixth sense—but I decide I can't live in fear. I block. No tricks—the Pawn dies, and out pops a fifth Eldrazi Spawn token for my opponent. Then he taps all five lands. Then he sacs all five Spawn. [Spawnsire of Ulamog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnsire+of+Ulamog)? Oh no, much worse.

![Kozilek, Butcher of Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kozilek%2C+Butcher+of+Truth)  
[Kozilek, Butcher of Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+Butcher+of+Truth). On turn *five*.

My opponent happily drew four cards (to a chorus of oohs and ahhs) and annihilated me in short order. Pow!
