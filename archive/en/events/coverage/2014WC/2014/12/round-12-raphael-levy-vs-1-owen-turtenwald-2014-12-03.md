The first-ranked player in the world.


That's a description that gets thrown around a little more these days. The near-weekly updates to the Top 25 ensure the ebb and flow of premier event victories are tracked. The better a player performs at more events, the higher their rank rises.


Owen Turtenwald, thanks to impressive performances at Pro Tours and Grand Prix in the second half of 2014, is the current claimant to the title. With the support of similarly high-ranking teammates Reid Duke and William Jensen—the third and seventh-ranked respectively—Turtenwald continues to add exclamation points to his impressive resume. While it would take several more wins to secure a World Championship Top 4, it would be a feather one could reasonably expect to appear in his hat at some point.



 For Lévy, his adventures with the World Championship began years ago. In a Top 8 dominated by players from the United States, he was the eighth that held out a stand for the rest of the world. While he fell short there, as captain of last year's French national team he helped secure victory in the 2013 World *Magic* Cup.





*Both France's Raphaël Lévy and the USA's Owen Turtenwald are hanging on, but another loss would prove disastrous for either player's Top 4 hopes.*
