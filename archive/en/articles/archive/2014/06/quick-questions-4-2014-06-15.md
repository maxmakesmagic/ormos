**What is the most overrated card in the format?**

*Marijn Lybaert: Probably [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack). I just don't like it. When I have been playing burn it has simply been bad. You would think it's good at least in the mirror to respond to your opponents [Warleader's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warleader%27s+Helix), but that never really happens.*

*Alessandro Portaro: [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid). I've never liked it. And against [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) it's a 2-mana do nothing card.*

*Tomoharu Saito: [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination). You can't afford to play it on turn three. And in the late game just drawing one extra card isn't good enough.*

*Lee Shi Tian: [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat).*

*Patrick Dickmann: [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), it's got worse with the release of [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight).*
