Can Turian finish up his career with a milestone by winning his first individual Pro Tour? Will Jonsson achieve that elusive feat for the first time himself? Will Stark solidify his status as the future of the game? Will Antoine Ruel win his first Pro Tour? Can Perez del Pozo or Herberholz win a Pro Tour on their very first try?
