**Modern Dailies and 8-Player Single-Elim Replaced by Modern Competitive League**


Due to the success of Competitive Constructed Leagues, we're going to be transitioning away from Modern Dailies and Modern 8-Player Single-Elimination Events into a Modern Competititve League to ensure that Modern players are able to find a challenging event to play in whenever they want, on their own schedule. Details on the Modern Competititve League can be found below.


These changes will occur with the May 18 downtime. The Modern Friendly League and Modern 2-Player Queues will continue to run as normal.


**League Begins**: May 18, following the downtime  
**Location**: Play Lobby -> Constructed Tournaments -> Leagues  
**Structure**: Five matches, each up to 50 minutes  
**Format**: Modern  
**Entry Options**:


* 12 Event Tickets
* 120 Play Points

**Prizes**:


 




| Match Wins | Match Wins | QPs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 Wins | 10 booster packs and 120 Play Points | 3 |
| 4 Wins | 6 booster packs and 120 Play Points | 1 |
| 3 Wins | 120 Play Points | 0 |

**NOTE:** Wizards of the Coast employees and other persons affiliated with it are eligible to play in this event. For more information, please see this [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/wizards-announces-wizards-play-policy-2015-01-30) and this [FAQ](https://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2312) about this policy.

**Reminder: No Downtime on May 11**


In an effort to make sure *Magic Online* is available when you want to play *Magic*, we’re working on ways to reduce the number of times we have to bring the system offline for maintenance. As a first step we’re simply going to eliminate at least one downtime each month.


Here are the dates of the exact downtimes we’ll be skipping in the first half of 2016:


* May 11
* June 8
* June 22

During these weeks without a downtime, *Magic Online* will NOT be processing set redemptions. **This means that if your order wasn't made prior to the May 4 downtime, it won't be processed until May 18.**
