***Patrick Dickmann:** I'm rooting for Jérémy Dezani. A good friend and a funny guy.*

***Willy Edel:** Someone from South America or Asia. I don't think a European or American player will win. If I had to pick someone who's not me, it'd be Lee Shi Tian.*

***Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:** Hopefully me!*

***Shahar Shenhar:** I will. Not just this year but next year too. We'll have to see about 2016."*

***Fabrizio Anteri:** I like Ivan Floch.*
