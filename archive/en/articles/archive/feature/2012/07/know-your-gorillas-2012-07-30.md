For today's Arcana, we have a quiz that appeared in the July 1996 issue of *The Duelist*. *Alliances* had just come out, and it was time to tell the world about the secret gorilla history of the set.

Click on the playtest name to see the actual name. And then you can mouse over the actual name to see what the card does, in case you're not 100% up on your *Alliances* cards.
