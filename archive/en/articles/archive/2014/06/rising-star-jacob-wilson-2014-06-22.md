 Let's take a little trip back in time. It's a cold day in Chicago back in November 2012. A young Jacob Wilson travels to The Windy City from Northern California with dreams of hoisting a trophy in the air. The dust has settled and only one opponent remains. Josh Utter-Leyton, one of the greatest *Magic* players in the world, is calm and deliberate, making every with play with surgical precision. Wilson is unphased, striving for perfection in his plays until the last card hits the table. Utter-Leyton smiles, extends his hand, and Wilson is crowned the Grand Prix Chicago Champion.
