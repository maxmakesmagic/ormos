Working on *Magic*'s Community team, we enjoy reading feedback from our passionate fans across the internet. One thing we've seen come up regularly over for several years is a simple question:


*"Why can't I buy that on a shirt?"*


As *Magic* fans, many of you would like to share that with the world, be it on your T-shirt or favorite coffee mug. We'd love you to do that too! But over here in Europe, that's unfortunately not been possible.


Until now! From this week, we have launched a partnership with Zavvi to bring you high-quality, officially licensed *Magic* items, including T-shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies, and even coffee mugs. These are available in a range of designs celebrating *Magic*'s history, colors of mana, and our return to Dominaria. All items are available across Europe and Russia, with fast and reasonable shipping.

What's more, we will update the range of designs and items available regularly with upcoming sets. Bookmark the store or sign up for Zavvi's email updates to see latest additions, and make sure you don't miss any limited-edition items.


Whether you want to say "NOPE" to everything your opponent plays, show your devotion to colorless, or boast of your degree from the Academy at Tolaria West, we hope you'll enjoy this new way to express your love of *Magic*.

As always, we really appreciate your feedback, so please let us know what you think on Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit. Note we cannot accept unsolicited design submissions, but if there's something you'd like to see in the future (*e.g.*, "more stuff with mana symbols," "a Belzenlok shirt"), we'll take this into consideration.


Wondering about the rest of the world? We already have a licensing manager working to bring you more official *Magic* items (such as [board games and miniatures](https://wizkids.com/2017/11/14/wizkids-expands-licensing-partnership-with-wizards-of-the-coast/) from WizKids), and we're currently recruiting for a [director of licensing](http://company.wizards.com/job/director-category-licensing) to lead these efforts globally. Expanding *Magic*'s brand into new areas is important to us, so you can expect to hear more on this in the future.
