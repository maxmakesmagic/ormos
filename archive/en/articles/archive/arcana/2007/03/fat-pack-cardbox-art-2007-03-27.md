The*Planar Chaos* Fat Pack (available everywhere that **Magic** cards are sold!) is chock full of goodies from the *Planar Chaos* novel, the Player's Guide, to a twenty-sided life counter, to extra basic lands, to extremely cool card storage boxes with custom art and color dividers.

*This photo contains an outdated shot of the Player's Guide with Akroma instead of [Serra Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Sphinx)*Here are a couple of detail views of the design wireframes of the card boxes, featuring art by Daren Bader of [Akroma, Angel of Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Fury) and the dragon [Oros, the Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oros%2C+the+Avenger). If you put the card boxes side-by-side, the art lines up across the two boxes. Check out those design wireframes for a stretched-out view of that art:
