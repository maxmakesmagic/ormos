*Do you have a question about **Magic: The Gathering** or Wizards of the Coast? Send it, along with your name and location, to us via this [email form](javascript:makeWinXY('/company/emailtoauthor.asp?author=Ask%20Wizards',500,455);). We'll post a new question and answer each day.*

Why didn't you translate the word "Planeswalker" on Russian *Shards of Alara* cards?  
**September 30, 2008**
**Q:** Why didn't you translate the word "Planeswalker" on Russian *Shards of Alara* cards? You already used such a fine word as "Мироходец" in Lorwyn, so why couldn't you do it again?  
 –Andrey, Moscow, Russia


**A:** From **Monty Ashley**, **Magic** Web Team:


The answer to this question is in the *Shards of Alara* FAQ (available on [the Magic Set FAQs page](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs)), with a twist: it's not in the English FAQ! This is because people looking just at the English cards would never know that our policy had changed.


Here's the relevant section:



> \*\*\*Ранее встречавшийся тип карты: Planeswalker (Мироходец)\*\*\*
> 
> 
> Тип карты, ранее называвшийся «Мироходец», изменяется. Начиная с выпуска Осколки Алары во всех языках будет использоваться одно и то же английское слово — «planeswalker».Planeswalker-ы постепенно становятся центральными литературными и игровыми персонажами Magic: The Gathering. 
> 
> 
> Использование единого названия в разных странах и языках позволяет упорядочить терминологию, как это уже было сделано несколько лет назад в отношении бренда Magic: The Gathering.　Игра Magic одинакова во всем мире, то же самое справедливо и по отношению к planeswalker-ам.  
>  Planeswalker-ы — могучие союзники, сражающиеся на вашей стороне.  
>  Пятеро из них дебютировали в выпуске Лорвин, и вот, наконец, в выпуске Осколки Алары появляются несколько новых героев.(Тип карты у тех пяти карт теперь изменяется на «planeswalker».)  
>  Информацию о том, как разыгрывать карты planeswalker-ов, можно найти в документе «Часто задаваемые вопросы (FAQ) — выпуск Лорвин» или на сайте по следующей ссылке:  
> [http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/rules/planeswalkers](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/rules/planeswalkers)
> 
> 


Oh, and for English-speakers who are wondering what that said, here's the original version that was translated but didn't go into the English FAQ:



> \*\*\*Returning Card Type: Planeswalkers ([insert translated planeswalker type here])\*\*\*
> 
> 
>  The name of the card type "[insert translated planeswalker type here]" is changing. Beginning with the \_Shards of Alara\_ set, the same word -- "planeswalker" -- will be the used in all countries. The planeswalkers are becoming pivotal characters in the \_Magic: The Gathering\_ storyline and game; unifying their name is a way to create a common language across the various countries, the same way the \_Magic: The Gathering\_ brand name was unified a couple of years ago. The \_Magic\_ game is the same everywhere in the world, and so are the planeswalkers.
> 
> 
> Planeswalkers are powerful allies you can call on to fight by your side. They were introduced in the \_Lorwyn\_ set, and this set contains the first new ones since the original five. (Those five cards now have the card type "planeswalker.")
> 
> 
> For information about how to play planeswalkers, please see the \_Lorwyn\_ FAQ or the following website:

Why have most of the white Soldiers in *Legions* lost their mouths?  
– ASK WIZARDS CLASSIC**September 29, 2008 – Double Ask Wizards Classic!****Q:** Why have most of the white Soldiers in *Legions* lost their mouths?  
 –Ryan, Ottowa, ON, Canada 


**A:** From **Brady Dommermuth**, **Magic** Creative Director:


![Lowland Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lowland+Tracker)
Thanks for asking, Ryan. Here's the deal with all the "mutations" in the *Legions* set: Deep in the Krosan Forest, the [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) lies buried in the ground, still attached to the sword [Kamahl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl) used to slay [Ambassador Laquatus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ambassador%2BLaquatus). The Mirari's twisted magic is emanating from Krosa like radiation, causing everything on Otaria to become an amplified, exaggerated version of itself. Wizards begin to liquefy, Goblins grow feral and hunched, Clerics emanate light, and Soldiers become huge, speechless battle-tanks. And the freakification isn't over; wait until you see the next step of magical evolution in the upcoming *Scourge* set.


**Q:** What are the weird swirly people on the *Scourge* cards meant to be? I've seen them on [Scornful Egotist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scornful+Egotist), [Grip of Chaos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grip+of+Chaos), and [Parallel Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallel+Thoughts), but I'm sure they pop up more often. I thought they might be avatars of the mana in Otaria, but if so where are the green, white and black ones?  
 –Hayden, Halifax, NS, Canada 


**A:** From **Brady Dommermuth**, **Magic** Creative Director:


![Scornful Egotist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scornful+Egotist)
In a previous Ask Wizards response, I explained how the creatures on Otaria are being twisted and evolved by the [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari)'s sickly magic. The 'liquid glass' creatures you see in the *Scourge* set are the final mutation/evolution step for Otaria's wizards. Their corporeal forms are almost drifting away -- they're becoming creatures of pure thought. The one on [Grip of Chaos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grip+of+Chaos) has been turned from bluish to red by the strange power of the enchantment.


*These questions first appeared on [February 12](/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-february-2003-2003-02-03) and [June 17](/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-february-2003-2003-02-03), 2003.

Is it possible for a creature to Devour Sprouting Thrinax and the three saprolings it creates when it hits the graveyard?  
RULES CORNER**September 26, 2008 – Magic Rules Corner**
**Q:** Is it possible for a creature to Devour Sprouting Thrinax and the three saprolings it creates when it hits the graveyard?  
 –Peter, MN, USA


**A:** From the **Magic** Rules Corner:


First off, let's make sure everybody's on the same page. Devour is a new mechanic in *Shards of Alara*. Here are two preview cards with devour:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Caldera Hellion | Mycoloth |

  

> 
> 502.82. Devour
> 
> 
> 502.82a Devour is a static ability. "Devour N" means "As this object comes into play, you may sacrifice any number of creatures. This permanent comes into play with N +1/+1 counters on it for each creature sacrificed this way."
> 
> 
> 502.82b Some objects have abilities that refer to the number of creatures the permanent devoured. "It devoured" means "sacrificed as a result of its devour ability as it came into play."
> 
> 
> 


Note that "any number of creatures" includes zero—you're never forced to sacrifice a creature because of devour if you don’t want to.


Okay, now let's take a look at Sprouting Thrinax:


![Sprouting Thrinax](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/tcg/products/shardsofalara/nx9mflzcgh_EN.jpg)  
Sprouting Thrinax has a triggered ability. Its trigger condition is "When Sprouting Thrinax is put into a graveyard from play[...]"


So let's say you play Caldera Hellion. As a creature spell (or an artifact, enchantment, or planeswalker spell) resolves, it comes into play. Devour says that you may sacrifice creatures "as" Caldera Hellion comes into play. This means that you get one chance to sacrifice creatures for devour: while Caldera Hellion is resolving.


You choose to sacrifice Sprouting Thrinax, and its "put into a graveyard" ability triggers. But that ability can't go on the stack yet, because you're still in the middle of resolving Caldera Hellion. Caldera Hellion finishes resolving and comes into play, and now it's time to put triggers on the stack. It's too late to sacrifice any creatures, and you still don't have any Saprolings. So the answer is **no—by the time the Saprolings come into play, the creature with devour is already in play.**


In the particular case of Caldera Hellion, there's a funny end to the story. Immediately after Caldera Hellion comes into play, there are two abilities that have triggered and are waiting to be put on the stack: the "put into a graveyard" ability of Sprouting Thrinax, and the "comes into play" ability of Caldera Hellion. Since you control them both, you get to choose the order in which they go on the stack. If you choose to put Sprouting Thrinax's ability on the stack first, Caldera Hellion's ability will resolve first. Caldera Hellion will deal 3 damage to each creature (including itself, but with the counter from devouring Sprouting Thrinax, it's a 4/4), then you'll put three Saprolings into play, so the Saprolings will survive to be devoured another day!

**Q:** I was wondering what cards have been reprinted in every core set since Alpha. I have been wondering this for a while but when the card of the day on Friday, August 8, 2008, I thought I would ask.

What was last weeks theme for Card of the Day?  
**September 23, 2008**
**Q:** What was last week's theme for Card of the Day?  
 –Various


**A:** From **Monty Ashley**, **Magic** Web Team:


For people who don't know what the question is about, a little background information is in order. The Card of the Day usually has a secret theme each week, often involving strained puns on the names of the cards. For example, a few weeks ago, we had this cycle:


[Blind Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Seer)  
[Horn of Deafening](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horn+of+Deafening)  
[Phage the Untouchable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phage+the+Untouchable)  
[Scrubland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrubland)  
[Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher)


The theme for that cycle was "cards that reference missing one of the five senses." As you can see, it starts fairly clean, with "blind" and "deaf" right there in the card names. Then Phage is "untouchable", so that's sort of like "no sense of touch." Then, for "no taste", there's Scru**bland**, which is admittedly kind of a cheat. And we couldn't find any cards at all for "no sense of smell", so we had to go with Faceless Butcher and a terrible joke about it having no nose. Hilarious!


Before getting to last week's (which wasn't really fair, since it combined a fairly obscure theme with a huge stretch), here are some of our favorite cycles from the past few months:


**August 5-7**


[Rubinia Soulsinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rubinia+Soulsinger)  
[Springleaf Drum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum)  
[Clambassadors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clambassadors)  
[Hair-Strung Koto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hair-Strung+Koto)  
[Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare)

**Theme: Rock Band.**  The first four cards represent the four instruments (singer, drum, bass, and the koto is close enough to a guitar), and the fifth card is the only **Magic** card that's also a song in Rock Band. That doesn't count downloadable content or Rock Band 2, which wasn't out yet.


**July 21-28**


[Barbary Apes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbary+Apes)  
[Echo Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echo+Chamber)  
[Copy Enchantment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copy+Enchantment)  
[Zuo Ci, the Mocking Sage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zuo+Ci%2C+the+Mocking+Sage)  
[Elvish Impersonators](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Impersonators)


Click here to see the theme!


**Theme: Mimic Week.**  Each of the five cards includes a synonym for "mimic", which was the theme of the articles that week.


**June 24-27**


[Street Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith)  
[Castle Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle+Sengir)

**Theme: The original five areas of Disneyland.** I was on vacation *at* Disneyland this week, so I made the cycle ahead of time. [Castle Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle+Sengir) is a bit of a cheat (it represents Fantasyland), but it turns out there aren't any cards with the word "Fantasy" on them anywhere.


**May 5-20**


[Rustspore Ram](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rustspore+Ram)  
[Bull Aurochs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bull+Aurochs)

[Jamuraan Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jamuraan+Lion)

[Crooked Scales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crooked+Scales)  
[Dross Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Scorpion)

**Theme: Signs of the (western) Zodiac.** I think this might be our only cycle that went for more than a week. And we got through it without having to resort to the Zodiac creatures from *Portal Three Kingdoms*! Since this cycle ended on a Tuesday, we had to decide what to do for the rest of that week. We ended up going with [Iceberg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iceberg), [Cloud Pirates](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Pirates), and [Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists) to go along with the vague water-theme suggested by [Clearwater Goblet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clearwater+Goblet) and [Island Fish Jasconius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island+Fish+Jasconius).


**April 7-11**


[Surge of Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surge+of+Strength)

**Theme: Cards whose names contain their precise mana cost.**  This is one of my favorite Card of the Day themes we've ever done, and I don't think the forums guessed it. It started when I noticed Su![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)e of Strength and Wa![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)ior's Oath. We threw in Disr![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)pt, but didn't want to do two cards like that. After we decided we didn't mind spaces, Glitterin![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)ish got added to the list. Incidentally, its initials are *also* ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif). That's kind of neat.


But we needed one more! Finally, and this was a decision that caused a surprising amount of debate, we went with [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter). Personally, I think that its cost of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) is perfectly demonstrated with B**one**splitter, but some member of the team think that's an outrageous cheat. I tried to convince them that one in Roman Numerals is "I", so you could have Bonespl**I**tter, but they weren't crazy about that either. Then I pointed out that if you're using a typewriter, you don't normally use the "1" key. Instead, you use the lowercase "l", hence: Bonesp**l**itter.


Okay, so that's the sort of thing we're talking about. But what about last week?

Okay, so it was kind of an obscure reference, I guess. But how good a job did we do with the cards? [Flash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash) is Grandmaster Flash. That one's fine. And [Grand Melee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Melee) is Melle Mel. Kind of a stretch there, maybe. I went with "Grand" Melee partly because [Melee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melee) isn't that interesting a card, and partly because he's **Grand**master Melle Mel. Cough. Then one of the Furious Five was called "Scorpio", so you've got [Pit Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Scorpion). And for Cowboy, [Krazy Kow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krazy+Kow). Ditto Kid Creole (not the one that sang "Endicott"; this was a different Kid Creole) and [Meddling **Kid**s](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Kids).


Already you're thinking this was an unfair cycle. It's a tough reference to begin with, and at least two of the cards are stretches. But it's even more unfair than that. You see, it was Grandmaster Flash *and* the Furious Five. He wasn't one of the Five himself. That means that in order to shoehorn [Flash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash) into the cycle, I had to bump someone. Sorry, Rahiem; your name was just too hard to find a card to match.


  
What is the story behind Sword of Fire and Ice and Sword of Light and Shadow?  
 –Billy  
– ASK WIZARDS CLASSIC**September 22, 2008 – Ask Wizards Classic****Q:** I was wondering what is the story behind [Sword of Fire and Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice) and [Sword of Light and Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Light+and+Shadow)? Why did you leave out green? And how did you choose the abilities?  
 –Eric, Winnipeg, MB, Canada 


**A:** From **Tyler Bielman**, **Magic** R&D:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Sword of Fire and Ice | Sword of Light and Shadow |

Verily, Eric of Winnipeg, a noble inquiry worthy of a grand tale. 


Seven millennia ago, Planeswalker Stern and Planeswalker Tinsman forged the swords to do battle in a blood-feud that would tear asunder the very foundation of reality.


Ok, not really. 


The Swords were created after *Darksteel* moved from Design into Development. History is unclear about who created them (I believe it was Henry Stern or Brian Tinsman), however they were created because we felt that there wasn't enough "Randomly Cool" equipment. "Randomly Cool" is a kind of code-term around here for splashy, interesting effects that have a lot of impact when you first see them. When I watched people open *Darksteel* packs at the Pre-release tournament, it was great to see people respond the way we had hoped. 


As far as green's absence goes, you may know that each color in **Magic** has two enemy colors. However, when looking at the colors symbolically, there is usually a more obvious animosity toward one enemy color or the other. 


For example, the enmity between White and Black is easier to see at a glance than the hostility between White and Red. Green is frequently an odd man out when looking at these snapshot relationships, because Nature doesn’t really have an enemy in that sense.


One of the fun things about designing *Mirrodin* was that we could play around with combining colored effects without making gold cards. We picked two of the more natural enemies, Red & Blue and White & Black and made cards that fooled around with what it would be like if those colors got together and 'made' a sword. The abilities changed a lot before we landed on the ones that were printed. Unfortunately, it would be nigh impossible to scribe that entire epic upon this measly page. Verily"

If I have the *Lorwyn* Ajani in play and someone else plays the new Ajani, will they both die?  
RULES CORNER**September 19, 2008 – Magic Rules Corner**
**Q:** With the release of Shards, there will be a new Ajani. If I have the *Lorwyn* Ajani in play and someone else plays the new Ajani, will they both die because of a state-based effect because they have the same planeswalker subtype (Ajani), or will nothing happen to either of them?  
 –Richard, Nashville, TN, USA


**A:** From the **Magic** Rules Corner:


This has been a surprisingly common question since the unveiling of *Shards of Alara*'s Ajani Vengeant:


![Ajani Vengeant](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/tcg/products/shardsofalara/0op465culb_EN.jpg)  
This Ajani, as you might be aware, is the redder, angrier counterpart to *Lorwyn*'s Ajani Goldmane:


![Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ajani+Goldmane)
Notice that although the two cards have different names, they share a subtype: Ajani.


Now let's take a look at the rule that covers what happens when two planeswalkers have the same subtype:


420.5q If two or more planeswalkers that share a planeswalker type are in play, all are put into their owners' graveyards.


This rule bears many superficial similarities to the "legend rule":


420.5e If two or more legendary permanents with the same name are in play, all are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the "legend rule." If only one of those permanents is legendary, this rule doesn't apply.


Both of these rules appear on the list of state-based effects, meaning that they apply any time a player would receive priority, right before that player receives priority. This in turn means that they can't be responded to; if two planeswalkers with the same subtype or two legendary permanents with the same name are in play, both are put into their owners' graveyards before any player gets a chance to do anything about it.


Both of these rules put the permanents directly into their owners' graveyards; this means that they can't be regenerated, and being indestructible won't protect them.


The biggest difference between the two rules, as you've noticed, is that the rule for planeswalkers is based on subtype, while the "legend rule" is based on names. Basically, the rule for planeswalkers keys off of subtype so that two planeswalker cards that represent the same character can't be in play together—regardless of whether they share an actual card name—addressing one of the major complaints about the legend rule. It's way too late to try to change the legend rule this way, but it wasn't too late for planeswalkers.


Finally, note that, although they are very similar rules, the subtype rule for planeswalkers and the "legend rule" are different. Planeswalkers aren't legendary, and Mirror Gallery won't affect them.

How do the name and picture of Ancestral Recall tie in to the action of the spell?  
**September 17, 2008**
**Q:** How do the name and picture of [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) tie in to the action of the spell?  
 –Cody, Burlington, VT, USA


**A:** From **Monty Ashley**, **Magic** Web Team:


Hmm. An oldie, eh? Let's look at the card:


![Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ancestral+Recall)
And (since I forgot this step when I answered the [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) question last week), let's look at a larger version of the art:


![Ancestral Recall](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/aw_091708.jpg)*[Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) full art by Mark Poole*


Unfortunately, we don't have the art description on file, which is the sort of thing that happens with fifteen-year-old cards. However, it just so happens that I, um, "know" the answer to this question. See the slight glow around the guy on the right? That is meant to suggest that he's not physically there in the vaguely Aztec setting. He's been brought back to the time of his ancestors, and now he's remembering things that they knew.


So that's the connection between the name and the art. Mechanically, this knowledge of his ancestors is represented by getting a few more cards. In the same way that "brain damage" frequently means "discard a card" ([Addle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Addle), [Brainspoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainspoil), [Skull Fracture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skull+Fracture), and so on), "learning things" translates to "draw some cards" (directly with [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) and [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) and indirectly with cards like [Collective Unconscious](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Unconscious)). This seems like a good time to mention [The Bake a Cake Example](/en/articles/archive/bake-cake-example-2005-11-22), which describes one way to imagine what cards in your library "mean", although that example doesn't explore the flavor difference between the hand and the graveyard.


  
How are Naya and Jund pronounced?  
**September 16, 2008**
**Q:** How are Naya and Jund pronounced?


Nigh-uh, Neigh-uh, or my favourite: Nuh-YAH! And is it Junned (rhymes with shunned), Joond, or even Yoond?   
 –Pegaweb, Adelaide, Australia


**A:** From **Doug Beyer**, **Magic** Creative Writer:


Hi, Pegaweb! I'll go ahead and give you the whole pronunciation run-down on the names of the shards.


* Bant is pronounced with a short "A" sound. It rhymes with "plant" (your pronunciation of the vowel in "plant" may differ from mine, I realize).
* Esper rhymes with "vesper": ESS-per.
* Grixis has a hard "S" sound at the end, like "this" or "miss": GRIX-iss (not GRIX-iz).
* Jund does rhyme with "stunned," with the regular old "J" sound as in "just shut up and run, there's a dragon coming."
* Naya is pronounced NIGH-uh. It rhymes with "papaya" or "messiah," the way I say 'em.

Happy shard-exploring!


  
I've always wondered how much refreshments (especially coffee) the **Magic** R&D consumes every day. Are there some who manage to do their Magical work without the magic of caffeine?  
ASK WIZARDS CLASSIC**September 15, 2008 – Ask Wizards Classic****Q:** I've always wondered how much refreshments (especially coffee) the **Magic** R&D consumes every day. Are there some who manage to do their Magical work without the magic of caffeine?  
 –Lauri, Finland 


**A:**
**Paul Sottosanti**, **Magic** R&D:


Hey Lauri,


Thanks for the question. We debated for some time and came up with the following list:


**Top Five Most Caffeinated R&D Members**


1. 1. Richard Garfield
2. 2. Randy Buehler
3. 3. John Carter
4. 4. Henry Stern
5. 5. Mons Johnson

  
Richard is included at the top of this list not just for the name dropping factor, but because I'm told he likes caffeine more than all of R&D put together. When asked about the creator of **Magic**, Mark Rosewater paused, then answered, "Well, I've known Richard about nine or ten years, and...well, how about this. His email used to be [java@wizards.com](mailto:java@wizards.com). How's that?" Randy surely needs his caffeine more than ever after the birth of his daughter. John Carter, when asked how much he'd had today, replied that he was working on his third soda and his fourth cup of hot chocolate. Henry Stern, longtime **Magic** developer, and Mons Johnson, leader of a little known group of goblin raiders, also qualified due to almost daily coffee consumption.


As a bonus, we also compiled the opposite list:


**Top Five Least Caffeinated R&D Members**


1. 1. Mark Gottlieb
2. 2. Matt Place
3. 3. Paul Barclay
4. 4. Brian Schneider
5. 5. Me

  
Our very own evil genius, Mark Gottlieb, learned at Evil Camp that alcohol, meat, and caffeine all blunt your mental capabilities. His dedication to the quest for world domination means that he's sworn off all three. Matt Place starts each morning off with a few laps around the mana pool, so doesn't need the artificial stimulation. It's interesting to note that the previous Rules Manager, Paul Barclay, falls at third on this list while his replacement John Carter has an equal standing on the other one. Who knew that Rules Manager could be such a stressful job? In any case, John was then quoted as saying, "If I ever leave this position, I'll probably retire from caffeine as well." Paul and Brian both have the occasional soy hot chocolate at Starbucks, but keep it fairly light. And as for me, I seem to be immune to the stuff, and coffee tastes, well, terrible, so there's not much point.


So you could argue that the people who do partake in the magic of caffeine do better Magical work than the ones who don't, but some of us might disagree.


Your choice.


*This question first appeared on [October 19, 2004](/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-october-2004-2004-10-01). We haven't updated the survey, so it's no longer accurate.

Could you clarify the interactions that exist between effects that force a creature's P/T to be specific values versus effects that raise, lower, or switch that creatures P/T?  
RULES CORNER**September 12, 2008 – Magic Rules Corner**
**Q:** Could you clarify the interactions that exist between effects that force a creature's P/T to be specific values versus effects that raise, lower, or switch that creatures P/T?  
 –Various


**A:** From the **Magic** Rules Corner:


With [Lignify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lignify), [Godhead of Awe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godhead+of+Awe), [Snakeform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snakeform), the *Eventide* Mimics, and more arriving just in the last year, variations on this question have come up a lot. Rather than answer them piecemeal, we decided to bundle them together and teach you the underlying structure that helps determine the answers. We'll give a few examples at the end.


Rule 418.5 in the Comprehensive Rules covers the interaction of *continuous effects*—in other words, it tells you how to determine what characteristics a creature or other object in the game ends up with when multiple continuous effects apply to it at once. This is accomplished through a series of *layers*, which determine the order in which to apply those continuous effects to find the end result.


The first question, then, is "What is a continuous effect?" It's an effect from a spell or ability that lasts for some actual length of time. [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) creates a continuous effect, because its effect lasts until the end of the turn. Each of [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny)'s abilities creates a continuous effect, because its effect lasts until the end of the game. [Glorious Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem)'s ability creates a continuous effect, because its effect is true for as long as [Glorious Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem) is in play. (*One-shot effects*, on the other hand, happen immediately and then have no lasting effect. "Draw three cards" is an example of a one-shot effect.)


Understanding how the game handles continuous effects can be a mind-bending concept—but the key is right there in the name, and in the difference between continuous effects and one-shot effects. A one-shot effect (from [Harmonize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harmonize) or [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror), for example) changes the game state then immediately dissipates. A continuous effect, on the other hand, hangs around. [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) might feel like a one-shot effect because it's an instant, but that's not how it behaves. It doesn't deposit a +3/+3 bump on a creature and go away. Rather, imagine that its effect invisibly hovers over that creature for the stated period of time. As long as it's hovering, the +3/+3 bump is there. The tricky thing is that all continuous effects hover like this. If a creature is affected by [Mirrorweave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave), [Mind Bend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Bend), [Lignify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lignify), [Night of Souls' Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+of+Souls%27+Betrayal), and [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth), that creature has a lot of stuff hovering over it! The layer system determines what order those effects are applied in. Importantly, the order in which they're applied is *not* *necessarily* the order in which they showed up!


![Mirrorweave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mirrorweave)So let's take a look at the layers. There are six of them, and they're applied in order from 1 to 6. In every moment of every game, the game automatically rebuilds each permanent from the ground up. It starts with the printed wording on a card (or the original characteristics of a token), then applies all the continuous effects hovering over it in layer order, and winds up with the permanent's current characteristics. It's an eternal refresh.
 The unofficial Layer 0 is the original card or token. That's what you start with.  
**Layer 1 is for copy effects.** ([Mirrorweave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave), [Clone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone), and so on.) Those come first.  
**Layer 2 is for control-change effects.** ([Threaten](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten), [Confiscate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscate), and so on.)  
**Layer 3 is for text-changing effects.** ([Glamerdye](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glamerdye), [Artificial Evolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificial+Evolution), and so on.)  
**Layer 4 is for type-changing effects.** ([Imagecrafter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imagecrafter), [Leyline of Singularity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Singularity), and so on.)  
**Layer 5 is a catchall; it's for everything else except power and toughness-changing effects.** Generally, this means things that change a permanent's colors and abilities ([Aphotic Wisps](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphotic+Wisps), [Canopy Claws](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Claws), and so on.)  
**Layer 6 is for power- and toughness-changing effects.** But there's more to this story...


We'll get to layer 6 in a moment. First, you may have noticed that lots of spells and abilities have effects that fit into multiple layers. In those cases, the effects are split apart and each piece applies in the appropriate layer. For example, [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village)'s effect says that it becomes a creature that's still a land (layer 4), becomes an Ape (layer 4), becomes green (layer 5), has trample (layer 5), and becomes 3/3 (layer 6)!


OK, back to layer 6. There are lots of different kinds of effects that can change a creature's power and toughness, so layer 6 has a layer system all its own. There are five sublayers, and they're applied in order from a to e.


**Sublayer 6a is for characteristic-defining abilities (or CDAs).**  
 If a creature has a \* in its power/toughness box, it's got a CDA to define its power, toughness, or both. This comes first because it's a substitute for a number in the power/toughness box. Examples include [Overbeing of Myth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overbeing+of+Myth), [Coiling Woodworm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coiling+Woodworm), and [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf).


**Sublayer 6b is a catchall; it's for everything not covered in sublayers 6a, 6c, 6d, or 6e.**  
 Specifically, this covers effects from resolved spells and abilities that change a creature's power or toughness (like [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) or [Afflict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict)), effects from resolved spells and abilities that set a creature's power or toughness to a specific value (like [Battlegate Mimic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlegate+Mimic) or [Snakeform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snakeform)), and effects from static abilities that set a creature's power or toughness to a specific value (like [Lignify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lignify) or [Godhead of Awe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godhead+of+Awe)).


**Sublayer 6c is for changes from counters.**  
 These are effects from +1/+1 counters, -1/-1 counters, and any other counters that directly alter power and/or toughness. Applying them in this sublayer means they *always* apply.


**Sublayer 6d is for effects from static abilities that modify power or toughness but don't set them to a specific value.**  
 These are effects that, like counters, are sitting on the board giving a constant power/toughness bonus (or a constant negative). Examples include [Glorious Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem), [Night of Souls' Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+of+Souls%27+Betrayal), [Blanchwood Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blanchwood+Armor), and [Vulshok Battlegear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear). Applying them in this sublayer means they *always* apply.


**Sublayer 6e is for effects that switch a creature's power and toughness.**  
 These are always applied last. That makes the bookkeeping easier; you can do all of the other calculations first, then switch the resulting values. Examples include [Inside Out](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inside+Out) and [Crag Puca](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crag+Puca).


Effects that apply in sublayer 6c, 6d, and 6e never conflict with one another—they all apply. But effects in sublayer 6b can conflict with one another, and that's where the confusion comes in. If effects within a particular layer or sublayer overwrite one another (for example, one effect says a permanent is green then a later one says it's blue, or one effect gives a creature +3/+3 then a later one says it becomes 1/1), the effects are usually applied in *timestamp order*. This is a fancy way of saying that they're applied in the order that they first took effect, so the most recently played one wins. There are exceptions, but they're obscure enough to not worry about.


### Layer 6 in Action


*Example 1:* [Shorecrasher Mimic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shorecrasher+Mimic) (2/1) is in play. Its controller plays a spell that's green and blue. [Shorecrasher Mimic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shorecrasher+Mimic)'s ability triggers and resolves, and it becomes 5/3 (layer 6b). Later in the turn, it's targeted by [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) (also layer 6b). The effects are applied in timestamp order, so [Shorecrasher Mimic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shorecrasher+Mimic) is 8/6.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Shorecrasher Mimic | Giant Growth |

*Example 2:* [Shorecrasher Mimic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shorecrasher+Mimic) (2/1) is targeted by [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) (layer 6b), giving it +3/+3, making it 5/4. Later in the turn, its controller plays a spell that's green and blue. [Shorecrasher Mimic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shorecrasher+Mimic)'s ability triggers and resolves (also layer 6b). The effects are applied in timestamp order, so [Shorecrasher Mimic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shorecrasher+Mimic) is 5/3.


*Example 3:* [Hill Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant) (3/3) is enchanted with [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) (layer 6d). It's 6/6. It's then targeted by [Snakeform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snakeform), setting its power and toughness to 1/1 (layer 6b). [Hill Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant) is 4/4.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |

*Example 4:* [Hill Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant) (3/3) has two -1/-1 counters on it (layer 6c). It's 1/1. [Godhead of Awe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godhead+of+Awe) comes into play, setting all creatures' power and toughness to 1/1 (layer 6b). [Hill Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant) is -1/-1. Its toughness is less than 1, so it's put into its owner's graveyard.

*Example 5:* [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) (2/4) is targeted by [Inside Out](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inside+Out) (layer 6e). It's 4/2. Later in the turn, it's enchanted with [Torpor Dust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Dust) (layer 6d). [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) is 4/-1. Its toughness is less than 1, so it's put into its owner's graveyard.

*Example 6:* [Overbeing of Myth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overbeing+of+Myth) is in play. Its controller has five cards in hand, so it's 5/5 (layer 6a). An effect puts two +1/+1 counters on it (layer 6c), making it 7/7. It's targeted with [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) (layer 6b), making it 10/10. Later in the turn, it's targeted by [Snakeform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snakeform) (layer 6b). [Snakeform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snakeform) applies after the Overbeing's CDA (because of sublayer order) and after [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth)'s effect (because of timestamp order), but before the effect from the two counters (because of sublayer order again). [Overbeing of Myth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overbeing+of+Myth) is 3/3.

[Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) (2/4) is targeted by [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) (layer 6b). It's 5/7. [Mirrorweave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave) then turns it into a copy of [Wood Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wood+Elves) (layer 1). It's now a 4/4 [Wood Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wood+Elves).


So next time you play [Wings of Velis Vel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wings+of+Velis+Vel) on an activated [Marsh Flitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter) with two +1/+1 counters on it, you'll know what happens!

I'm an American citizen currently living in Japan. Which Nationals can I play in?  
**September 11, 2008**
**Q:** I have a bit of a convoluted question for you. Here's the situation I find myself in...


I'm an American citizen currently living in Japan. I arrived here at the end of July, 2008, and will be here until August, 2009 at the earliest.(I may decide to stay longer) I'm not a Japanese citizen and don't plan on attempting to become one, but I do have a visa for three years.


I competed at my local Regionals tournament in June back in the States for fun, and know that I cannot compete in any other country's regionals/nationals this year. However, what can I do next year?


A) Must compete in the States because I'm an American citizen (and not a Japanese).  
 B) Must compete in Japan because I was a resident of Japan as of January 1st, 2009.  
 C) Can compete in either one as I was a resident of Japan as of January 1st, 2009, AND am an American citizen.  
 D) Compete in neither because I'm not a Japanese citizen, and I am not residing in America as of January 1st, 2010.  
 E) Another possibility I haven't thought of.


I noticed in the eligibility criteria that permanent residents were also allowed to compete in the country's nationals. Would I qualify under that as I am living in Japan(and have a job here) rather than visiting?


Thanks, and I apologize if this makes anyone's head hurt.(it makes mine!)  
 –Brendan, Chiba-ken, Japan


**A:** From **Scott Larabee**, Senior Organized Play Content Designer:


The answer to your question is "C".


The rules for which National You can play in can be found in the Magic Premier Event Invitation Policy. The specific rules are:



> **Residential Eligibility**
> 
> 
> Each National Championship is open only to those DCI members who are citizens or have been residents of that country since January 1 of the year of the National Championship.
> 
> 
> Players may compete in only one National Championship per season. If a player competes in a City Championship Final or Regional tournament (such as a Regional Championship, National Qualifier, open tournament, or other tournament offering an invitation to a National Championship) in one country, he or she may not compete in City Championship Final, Regional tournaments or National Championships for another country until the following season. Please see section 3 – Residential Eligibility for complete information.
> 
> 
> 


You may always play in the Nationals of a country of which you are a citizen. You may play in the Nationals of a country of which you are a resident, provided you have been a resident of that country since January 1 of the year in question.


If you are eligible for multiple National Championships, and you play in the Regionals, National Qualifier, etc for one country, you may not play in the Nationals for another country.


  
What was the art description for Tarmogoyf?  
**September 10, 2008**
**Q:** [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) is considered one of the best creatures of all time, but the art is so dark it is difficult to tell what is going on in the picture. What was the art description for Goyf?  
 –Andy, Minneapolis, MN, USA


**A:** From **Monty Ashley**, **Magic** Web Team:


Here's the art description:



> Location: Arctic world in a blizzard  
>  Action: Show a variation on the Lhurgoyf, a monster unique to Magic. This creature should resemble the Lhurgoyf a little but can be stranger in form.  
>  Focus: the ancient and terrible Lhurgoyf  
>  Mood: a devouring monstrosity  
>  Notes: Not set in world of styleguide. Design an alternate MAGIC reality!

I remember seeing this crazy flowchart printed in The Duelist to resolve damage prevention effects (or something). Do you have that lying around?  
**September 9, 2008**
**Q:** I started playing back in revised, taking several breaks along the way. One of the pleasant surprises when I returned was how good the Sixth Edition rules were.


I don't remember the rules around when I began playing in detail, so do you think you could take us to a trip back to the dark days of the interrupt, possibly by putting up some old rules articles, or explaining some of the more egregious quirks? Specifically, I remember seeing this crazy flowchart printed in The Duelist to resolve damage prevention effects (or something). Do you have that lying around?  
 –Matthew, Sydney, Australia


**A:** From **Monty Ashley**, **Magic** Web Team:


I actually do! In fact, that issue of *The Duelist* (Issue #9, from February 1996) is on my desk and open to that article and its neat timing maps already. How convenient for me!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/mtgcom_arcana_130_pic1.jpg)The idea here is that the rats tell you which direction to go in the corridors, the squares are "trapdoors" that are mandatory detours to other charts, and the diamonds are "potential" trapdoors. The green-shaded corridors can only be followed during the active player's main phase and not during an attack.


The reason I had the magazine open was that I was hoping to use these maps as Arcana fodder. Unfortunately for me, Arcana got there [six years ago](/en/articles/archive/rules-maze-2002-07-03). Phooey! But you can go there for a couple of the other maps.


  
I noticed a **Magic** *Invasion* poster on Peter Parker's wall in the new *Spider-Man* movie. Was it a paid advertisement on Hasbro/WotC's part or is it pure coincidence that the geeky Peter Parker plays **Magic**?  
ASK WIZARDS CLASSIC**September 8, 2008 – Ask Wizards Classic****Q:** I noticed a **Magic** *Invasion* poster on Peter Parker's wall in the new *Spider-Man* movie. Was it a paid advertisement on Hasbro/WotC's part or is it pure coincidence that the geeky Peter Parker plays **Magic**?  
 –Terry, Burton, MI, USA 


**A:** From **Scott Rouse**, **Magic** Marketing Manager:


Peter Parker has been a huge **Magic: The Gathering** player for a number of years. In fact, prior to the incident at the lab with the genetically engineered arachnid, Peter was trying to qualify for the Pro Tour. With his new role as a crime fighter, he has less time to play with the fellas down at Neutral Ground, but I hear he has been doing some late night beta testing for **Magic Online**.


Seriously though, movie production designers will often place props into a scene to create a more realistic environment. The producers of the *Spider-Man* movie thought Peter Parker would be the type of person who would play **Magic**. In December 2000 the *Spider-Man* movie production team contacted us looking for **Magic** and **D&D** items to place in Peter Parker's bedroom. I jumped at the chance to get **Magic** products in a sure-to-be blockbuster movie about one of the best superheroes ever. That same day I sent a package of cards, novels, binders, and posters off to Columbia Pictures. We would have to wait over a year to find out if they used any of the items we sent. In the September 2001 issue of *Wizard Magazine*, a sneak peek look at Peter's movie set bedroom confirmed the use of a **D&D** poster but there was no mention of anything from **Magic**. When the movie was released we were very excited to see they had used an *Invasion* poster in Peter's bedroom. We did not pay a fee for the placement of the posters in the movie, although that is a very common practice in the entertainment industry.

What happens to blockers when you attack with two [Nath's Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Elite) or similar creatures? I can't even find an answer for this in the comprehensive rules.  
RULES CORNER**September 5, 2008 – Magic Rules Corner**
**Q:** What happens to blockers when you attack with two Nath's Elite or similar creatures? I can't even find an answer for this in the comprehensive rules.  
 –Brendan, Southbury, CT, USA


**A:** From the **Magic** Rules Corner:


The answer is in the Comprehensive Rules, in section 500, "Legal Attacks and Blocks." But because there are many situations that can arise that are much more complicated than this, the answer is a bit buried (the Comprehensive Rules being, after all, comprehensive). Let's tease it out.


That section of the Comp. Rules lays out two types of effects that can change attacking and blocking decisions: *restrictions* and *requirements*. Restrictions determine when creatures can't attack or block; requirements determine when a creature must attack or block.



![Nath's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nath%27s+Elite)
![Nath's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nath%27s+Elite)

Restrictions are pretty simple to deal with: all restrictions must be obeyed. A creature with flying and shadow can't be blocked by a creature that can't block both flying creatures and shadow creatures. A creature with "This creature can't be blocked by more than one creature" and "This creature can't be blocked except by two or more creatures" can't be blocked at all; there are no circumstances in which a block obeys both restrictions.


Requirements, however—like that of [Nath's Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Elite)—can get a little more complicated when there's more than one of them at work. A set of attackers or blockers obeys a requirement if it (1) meets the requirement to the extent possible without violating restrictions, and (2) results in the maximum possible number of requirements being followed (which may be less than the total number of requirements).


![Foriysian Interceptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Foriysian+Interceptor)
Let's look at what that means. Part (1) is simple: your tapped creatures, creatures with unpaid costs to block, and creatures that can't block [Nath's Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Elite), such as [Scavenging Scarab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Scarab) or [Gloomwidow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gloomwidow), don't have to block [Nath's Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Elite). Note that bit about "unpaid costs"—[Nath's Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Elite) can't force a creature enchanted with [Cowed by Wisdom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cowed+by+Wisdom) to block, because it can't force that creature's controller to pay the cost associated with blocking.


Part (2) determines what happens when two [Nath's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nath%2527s%2BElite) attack at once. Any set of blockers is legal if it causes the maximum number of requirements to be met. Since blocking one [Nath's Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Elite) fulfills one requirement and blocking the other [Nath's Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Elite) also fulfills one requirement, your creatures that can block [Nath's Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Elite) can each legally block either one of them. Any set of creatures where each creature is blocking as many [Nath's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nath%2527s%2BElite) as it can block is a legal set of blockers.


If you control creatures, such as [Foriysian Interceptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foriysian+Interceptor), that can block more than one creature, each one must block both [Nath's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nath%2527s%2BElite), because the maximum number of requirements that can be fulfilled for those creatures is two. Creatures that can block more than two creatures, such as [Avatar of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avatar+of+Hope), can still block other creatures, as long as they are blocking both [Nath's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nath%2527s%2BElite).


No matter how many restrictions and requirements are at work on a set of attackers or blockers, remember: restrictions must be obeyed, the maximum number of requirements that don't violate restrictions must be obeyed, and requirements can't force you to pay costs.

How can I tag the "Daily MTG" page as a favorite so that I don't have to load through all the flash intros each time I go to read the articles?  
**September 4, 2008**
**Q:** How can I tag the "Daily MTG" page as a favorite so that I don't have to load through all the flash intros each time I go to read the articles?  
 –Glen, Morrisville, NC, USA


**A:** From **Dave Guskin**, **magicthegathering.com** Web Developer:


Hi Glen! Different web browsers handle favorites, sometimes called bookmarks, slightly differently. You can navigate directly to Daily MTG using the direct URL <http://www.dailymtg.com/>. When you type in this URL, it will immediately redirect your web browser to the page <http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/default.aspx>. This is the page you want to favorite / bookmark.


Once you're looking at the Daily MTG front page, you can save it using the shortcut key combination **Ctrl + D** on Windows, or **Cmd + D** on a Mac. If you prefer, you can click the Favorites Menu (in Internet Explorer) or the Bookmarks menu (in Firefox) and click "Add to Favorites" or "Bookmark this Page," respectively. By default, browsers will name the record with that webpage's title—in this case, "Daily MTG : Magic: The Gathering". Feel free to change that to taste.


As an aside, you can quickly skip the Flash intros without waiting for them to load by going down to the footer at the bottom of that page and clicking the **Magic: the Gathering** logo or the "Continue to the **Magic**  Main Page" button.


  
How difficult is it for weekly columnists like Mark Rosewater to actually remember any interesting design/development stories about the current set?  
**September 3, 2008**
**Q:**  I remember reading somewhere that Magic expansions are completed by R&D well over a year before we get to see them. How difficult is it for weekly columnists like Mark Rosewater to actually remember any interesting design/development stories about the current set?  
 –Luke, Sydney, Australia


**A:** From **Mark Rosewater**, **Magic** Head Designer:


Luke,


It's part memory and part looking things up. We have a database that tracks every change so anything we're fuzzy on we can check. In addition, we spend a lot of time working on the same things over and over so certain things tend to stick. 


  
In a picture from your website, the color wheel was out of order. Is this some kind of sneaky hint that you are planing to change the color wheel, or is it just a printing error?  
**September 2, 2008**
**Q:** In [this picture](http://www.wizards.com/sideboard/images/gpcop08/Jim-Nelson-hard-at-work.jpg) from your website, the color wheel is out of order, with blue and black switched, and with red on top instead of white. Is this some kind of sneaky hint that you are planing to change the color wheel, or is it just a printing error?  
 –Josh, Birmingham, AL, USA


**A:** From **Helene Bergeot**, **Magic** Brand:


Thanks for writing! I wish I had a fascinating story to share, but this was just a printing error. We work with various agencies across the world and most of the designers are not familiar with the game, which can lead to this type of mistake. It’s actually not the first time such an error has happened, although it’s probably the first time it involved a branding material as visible as a Grand Prix back drop—the next set of Grand Prix banners will feature a correct color wheel!
