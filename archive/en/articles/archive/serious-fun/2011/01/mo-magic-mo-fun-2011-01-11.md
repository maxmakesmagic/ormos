 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






Welcome to the week *before* the first *Mirrodin Beseiged* preview week! Yes, I know the pain of there being no card to ogle and share is daunting. I promise: *the awesome* is coming.

So what do we do in the meantime? Perhaps a quick draft or two isn't something you're keen on with the latest set just around the corner. Maybe building more decks with *Scars of Mirrodin* isn't very exciting at the moment. You might even think there isn't any way to fill the time with something that provides nigh endless amusement.

*You would be wrong.*

To say that I play a lot of **Magic** is a fair assessment. But it's how I play that **Magic** that may surprise you: I almost always play with paper cards. Whether it's a product of my fascination with the smell of freshly opened booster packs, the comfort of using the cards I'd carried by hand for so long, or the dynamic environment of sitting down socially with friends, paper **Magic** is just how I do it.

But I put the "almost" in there because I'm on an adventure. I want to try more **Magic** than I have ever before and the biggest piece I'm missing is the digital kind: **Magic Online**.

There's a lot of ways to get into **Magic Online** and it's up to you to find the way that works for you. I'll share a few over the coming months but today I have the most hilariously awesome ways to play in the digital age. It's something that despite being popular and hilariously random is almost impossible to replicate outside **Magic Online**.

I'm speaking, of course, about [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) Basic Vanguard.

As an avid fan of Vanguard I knew about Mr. [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) from back when *Dissension* was released and the format first emerged. It wasn't until late last year when the [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) Basic Event Deck was released online that I actually decided to pull the trigger. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_momir.jpg)*Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar art*  
**Momir Basic Vanguard****In Brief:** [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) Basic Vanguard is a **Magic Online** format where all players use a deck of basic lands and generate random creatures from across the entire breadth of **Magic**.


**Rules Rundown:** You'll need the [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar), Simic Visionary online avatar as well as a deck of 60 basic lands. (This is the convenient mix within the [Momir Basic Event Deck](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/mtgomomirvig/productinfo) available for purchase under Special Sets in the online Store.) The only two options for actions players have initially are to play a land for a turn as well as use the [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) avatar to generate a random creature token of a creature of the converted mana cost of the ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) paid.


You start with four extra life thanks to the avatar, but everything else is a normal game of **Magic**.


**Pros:** With perhaps the easiest deck ever to build, [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) Basic Vanguard is incredibly easy to get going. Every game is unique and different thanks to the random creatures you and your opponent will create. Combat, abilities, and the enters/leaves the battlefield triggers of creatures all play out in amazing ways.


**Cons:** Randomization is a fickle mistress. Just like [Warp World](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warp+World) and [Stitch in Time](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitch+in+Time), things can go both for and against you. There are creatures that are less than exciting to receive (like [Phage the Untouchable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phage+the+Untouchable) or [Drake Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drake+Familiar)) and some that feel incredibly unfair if they appear against you (like [Hoverguard Sweepers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hoverguard+Sweepers)). Playing with a good sense of humor is definitely required.


  
In sum, [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) Basic is a way to play with every creature in **Magic** without even needing to own any. Just sign up for **Magic Online**, grab the event deck, *and go* (in two easy steps):

### 1. Head to the Casual Play room.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_01.jpg)  
### 2. Start a Momir Basic under Constructed.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_02.jpg)  
While you get a sense of what [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) Basic is all about from the details above, let's dive into what these games actually feel like.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_match1Headera.jpg)  
The player futant was my first opponent and a friendly one at that. I rolled out with a [Goblin Legionnaire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Legionnaire), [Krosan Warchief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Warchief), and [Nagao, Bound by Honor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nagao%2C+Bound+by+Honor) to an opposing force of [Fire Ants](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+Ants), [Tibor and Lumia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tibor+and+Lumia), and [Shard Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix).

When futant was gifted a [Storm Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Spirit), the fan got hit. I popped my [Goblin Legionnaire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Legionnaire) to take out the [Fire Ants](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+Ants). Then ... oops.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_03.jpg)  
A mistake was made. Of course, my mind didn't process seeing the [Shard Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix) ability on the stack, so ...

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_04.jpg)  
A click later and I missed my chance to activate [Krosan Warchief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Warchief)'s regeneration ability.

  
With the boards missing many creatures I was still in a tight spot: [Storm Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Spirit) was what felt like a huge creature while I didn't have my own with flying. After I dropped the [Anti-Bob](/en/articles/archive/orgg-vs-bob-accounting-2004-12-02) ([Trained Orgg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trained+Orgg)) I was dismayed to see futant's follow up turn yield the *actually huge* [Devouring Strossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Strossus).

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_05.jpg)  
At 11 life, that's game when [Skeletal Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Wurm) is what you get to summon. Thanks again, futant!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_match2Headera.jpg)  
It wasn't long after that ending that I had jumped into another game, this time with greg\_champ84. It started out pretty similarly, a few smaller creatures ([Ohran Viper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ohran+Viper) being the scariest by far) starting each other down.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_06.jpg)  
We traded a few creatures but what I wanted was a clean way to trade away for [Ohran Viper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ohran+Viper). What I got was an [Exalted Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Dragon).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_07.jpg)  
Which, in a frank matter of speaking, is referred to as a "bombo" in **Magic**. The Dragon met the Viper, which ended the prospect of some card draw, but was supplanted by a [Woodcrasher Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodcrasher+Baloth). My [Craw Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm) was a little less sexy gift from the random-machine brain controlling the game.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_08.jpg)  
I took a mean hook to the jaw, but I was still standing after trading some creatures away. Unfortunately, [Titanic Bulvox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Bulvox) promised a swift demise. Giving the creature die an 8-converted-mana-cost chuck I received one of my favorite creatures from the original *Mirrodin* era: [Living Hive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Hive).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_12.jpg)  
There are worse ways to go than with a trusty companion! Thanks greg\_champ84!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_03.jpg)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_match3Headera.jpg)  
I was hoping a little luck would be on my side going into another game, this one paired against Nemeros. Like the other games, we started off at a bit of a stalemate.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_09.jpg)  
But one of the best parts about [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) is that your luck can change in an instant: a [Looming Hoverguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Hoverguard) appeared for me and set the balance firmly in my favor.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_10.jpg)  
After trading my [Siege Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Wurm) for a [Craw Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm), luck decided to look favorably upon Nemeros: [Archdemon of Unx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archdemon+of+Unx).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_11.jpg)  
Finally! Something for a truly back-and-forth tussle!

So what happened? Technology. I think.

  
I slipped in a [Silver Seraph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Seraph) and the Archdemon upgraded [Golgari Thug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Thug) from a 1/1 to a 2/2 for Nemeros. But when the Archdemon struck across, and I chose not to block since my creatures would be getting a huge +2/+2 treatment thanks to the [Seraph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seraph) next turn, it looked like Nemeros got disconnected.

When Nemeros was back, the Archdemon finished combat damage. Then, just before I made another eight-mana creature and turned on [Silver Seraph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Seraph)'s threshold ability, Nemeros gave up the ghost.

I'm not sure why it happened that way but such is the way of things. I guess this counts as a win, right?

### Taking Momir to 11

I had an absolute blast playing [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) and I'm itching to do it again. If you've already tried [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) Basic Vanguard there is one way to crank the power up on the experience. Add two different vanguard avatars: [Jhoira of the Ghitu Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Jhoira%2Bof%2Bthe%2BGhitu%2BAvatar) and [Stonehewer Giant Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Stonehewer%2BGiant%2BAvatar).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf125_avatars.jpg)*Jhoira of the Ghitu and Stonehewer Giant avatar art*  
What does this do? Well, for starters it means you create a Freeform Vanguard game with the text of MoJhoSto in there.


> * [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) and a deck of all basic lands is still required and will function in the same way.
> * [Jhoira of the Ghitu Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Jhoira%2Bof%2Bthe%2BGhitu%2BAvatar) is somewhat similar avatar to [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar), except with a fixed cost of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif) to activate and gives you choices of an instant or sorcery.
> * [Stonehewer Giant Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Stonehewer%2BGiant%2BAvatar) automatically equips every creature you play through [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) with an Equipment card with converted mana cost equal to or less than what you paid.
> 

Yes, you're reading that right: tons of free Equipment and even more random, varied spells now of types other than creature! Australian native Russell Tassicker recently [wrote about this](http://topdeckhero.com/2011/01/11/160/) way to play, though he certainly wasn't the first to concoct this creation. If [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar) seems tame or boring, MoJhoSto is something on a whole different order of awesome!

I'm sure after I work out some more kinks in using the interface, like not clicking unless I'm 100% sure what's going on, I'll be humming along and slinging some more basic lands. If you've tried [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Momir%2BVig%252C%2BSimic%2BVisionary%2BAvatar), Momir or other great ways to play through **Magic Online** please share! I'd love to hear how you're making the most of the digital digs.

Join us next week when *Mirrodin Besieged* shows us why knowing is double the battle.
