China's last hopes to retain the Champion trophy on local soil lay in the hands of Liu Yuchen, He Yue and Zhang Zhiyang. It wasn't going to be easy though, because they were matched against Yuuya Watanabe, Makihito Mihara and Yuuki Ichikawa in their semifinals.

### Table A: Liu Yuchen (White-Black Allies) vs. Yuuya Watanabe (White-Red)


Watanabe's deck focused on doling out early damage with the help of efficient beats such as [Kor Castigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Castigator)s and annoyances like [Firemantle Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firemantle+Mage)s. The pair of [Angelic Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Gift)s would prove to be a great tool, especially when paired with bigger threats such as [Ondu Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ondu+Champion), [Shatterskull Recruit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatterskull+Recruit) or [Deathless Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathless+Behemoth)! [Planar Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Outburst) and Ondu Uprising offered the potential for blowout situations.

Liu's Allies deck was also of similar nature, but he did have access to some lifegain cards such as [Kalastria Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Healer) and [Drana's Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drana%27s+Emissary) that could swing the race in his favor.


Both players traded [Kor Castigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Castigator)s and tried to flood the board with threats during a temporary respite. However, a timely Ondu's Uprising reduced Liu's board to nothing, while Watanabe had a pair of [Valakut Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut+Invoker)s on his side. A couple of lands later, Liu realized that he was locked under these triggers and quickly reached for his sideboard.


The second game didn't go too well for Watanabe though, but he managed the comeback in Game 3 with [Kor Bladewhirl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Bladewhirl) and [Kor Castigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Castigator) against Liu's slow draw. Well, Liu was forced to mulligan and summoning nothing until turn five. By then, the writing was on the wall and Liu lamented his misfortune while he prayed for his teammates to win!

### Table B: He Yue (Red-Green Landfall) vs. Makihito Mihara (5-Color Green)


Mihara's colorful deck had a Blue-Green core with a splash for goodies such as double [Roil Spout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roil+Spout) and to maximize his Skyrider Elves. Topping out the curve were a bunch of badass Eldrazis, [Ruin Processor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+Processor), [Eldrazi Devastator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Devastator) and [Void Winnower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower), he also sought to abuse some of the Converge cards in his pile, such as the very fancy [Prism Array](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prism+Array).


He Yue would strive to end the game quickly before Mihara could reach his powerful endgame, with his Red-Green Landfall deck. A cursory glance indicated that he had all the archetype needed.


Facing a pair of [Snapping Gnarlid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Gnarlid)s, Mihara coughed out some speed bumps in the form of [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner), before clearing out He's hand with an Awakened [Mire's Malice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire%27s+Malice). That bought him enough time to land a 5/5 [Skyrider Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyrider+Elf), as well as [Prism Array](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prism+Array). Scrying 3 and tapping down He's board accordingly, Mihara quickly took Game 1.

*Triple threat!*


In cruel irony, Mihara lost his lead twice as quickly as he gained it. Flooding out after drawing ten lands, he was quickly crushed by three [Snapping Gnarlid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Gnarlid)s and an enormous [Territorial Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Territorial+Baloth).


In the third, Mihara kicked off with [Lifespring Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifespring+Druid) to enable a 5/5 [Skyrider Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyrider+Elf), which met with [Plummet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet) as soon as it hit the board. However, He had no creatures on the board until turn five, when he dropped [Territorial Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Territorial+Baloth). Mihara churned out [Catacomb Sifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Sifter) and [Ruin Processor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+Processor) and He's beatdown deck looked like it was out of possibilities.


How could one expect to punch past a 7/8 and deal 20 damage with just a single 4/4 on the board? To aggravate matters, an Awakened [Roil Spout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roil+Spout) reduced He to nothing. Another Awaken spell, this time [Mire's Malice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire%27s+Malice) cleared out He's hand. [Emeria Shepherd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Shepherd) gave He a fighting chance, but a topdecked [Prism Array](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prism+Array) allowed [Void Winnower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) to deal the finishing blow!


**He Yue 1—Makihito Mihara 2**

### Table C: Zhang Zhiyang (Blue-Black Ingest) vs. Yuuki Ichikawa (Blue-Red Devoid)


Ichikawa's deck was a hybrid of Ingest and Devoid. He was able to exile cards for processing via [Mist Intruder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Intruder) and [Benthic Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benthic+Infiltrator), in order to utilize two copies of each [Oracle of Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Dust) and [Ruin Processor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+Processor)s. Two copies of [Nettle Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Drone) and [Touch of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Touch+of+the+Void) offered his deck a little reach, backed by double [Spell Shrivel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Shrivel) and [Adverse Conditions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adverse+Conditions).


Dismissing some of Ichikawa's early threats with [Spell Shrivel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Shrivel) and [Complete Disregard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Complete+Disregard), Zhang tried to further cripple Ichikawa's resources with [Transgress the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind). Ichikawa revealed the last two cards in his hand ([Outnumber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outnumber) and [Processor Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Processor+Assault)) “fizzling” it.


He did, however, topdeck Ulamog's Reclaimer the next turn, which allowed him to kill Zhang's [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner) with [Outnumber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outnumber) before bringing it back from the yard. Zhang found insufficient creatures to outlast two removal spells in Ichikawa's hand, prompting him to scoop up his cards.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nettle+Drone)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Drone)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vile+Aggregate)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Aggregate)
In the second game, Ichikawa's opener of double [Nettle Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Drone) and [Vile Aggregate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Aggregate) provided a much faster clock than Zhang's [Culling Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Culling+Drone), [Benthic Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benthic+Infiltrator) and [Dominator Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dominator+Drone). Backed by [Spell Shrivel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Shrivel) and [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel), Ichikawa was able to continually deploy creatures while keeping them alive.


Despite Zhang's best attempts, no creature could slip by, aside from the unblockable 1/4. [Vestige of Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vestige+of+Emrakul) and [Oracle of Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Dust) fueled the final triggers of [Nettle Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Drone), and when Zhang tapped out for [Ugin's Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%27s+Insight), he was finished off by Ichikawa's entire team charging into the red zone.


**Zhang Zhiyang 0—Yuuki Ichikawa 2**
