Both Ralph Betesh and Daniel Cecchetti dispatched different Mono-Red Aggro opponents in the quarterfinals. While Betesh's large Abzan Aggro creatures proved to be too much, Cecchetti scraped by in his first game on 1 life before [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) did its work, while the second game involved him never leaving the driver's seat.



The two players wasted no times in getting underway.



**The Games**



Cecchetti stepped on the gas early with a first-turn [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) and a second-turn [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid). This let him power out a third-turn [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental), which began its manifesting mayhem while Betesh was left with only a [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer).

[Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) from Betesh cleared away the [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental), while Cecchetti followed up with [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater). Another [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) cleared the Hydra, and the Deathdealer traded with Cecchetti's mainfest...



...however, that one was just replaced with a new manifest off of Checcetti's follow-up second [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental). [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) disposed of the face-down creature, revealed to be a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), but trading cards for manifests is a losing game-plan, and Cechetti capitalized by dumping his hand: a new [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), a [Voyaging Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr), and the deck's key engine: [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen).



But [Banishing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light) off the top made things trivial a few turns later, relieving Betesh of his only blocker to secure the first game. There would be no monumental life-gain this game.



While [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance) allowed Betesh to remove Cecchetti's first play of the second game—a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix)—the Abzan Aggro player was also missing an essential component to allowing his deck to cast things like [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s: green mana.

Much like the last game, Cecchetti's high-impact creatures all demanded answers, and by turn five it came time to answer the following question:



Can Betesh deal with [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental)?



The answer to that question was “not until that fifth-turn [Sandsteppe Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandsteppe+Citadel) could untap,” at which point [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) disposed of the manifest-machine. It was promptly replaced by another copy from Checchetti. The green mana just came too late for Betesh.



The [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) Betesh deployed was met with a [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) turning face up. [Banishing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light), much like the first game, again removed Betesh's sole blocker, and a monstrous Polukranos ensured lethal with the [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental).



**Daniel Cecchetti defeats Ralph Betesh 2-0 and advances to the finals!**
