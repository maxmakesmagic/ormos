### The Preamble


As soon as he sat down at the Feature Match table, Brett Thompson had a question for his opponent: "So you're famous, right?"


Josh Utter-Leyton laughed. "For some defintions of famous, yeah."


"Are you in the Top 25 Rankings?"


"Yeah, I'm number two."


"Two.... wow."

*Brett Thompson*

Wow is right. Josh Utter-Leyton, reigning Player of the Year and backbone of Channel-Fireball's constructed playtesting, is a fearsome foe. He's come to Vancouver armed with a Blue-White-Red control deck that keys off powerful spells like [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) and [Jace, Architect of Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought).


Brett Thompson will have his work cut out for him. An Alberta native, Thompson moved to Vancouver five years ago. HeHe's enjoying his first Grand Prix, having spent the past year honing his skills at West Coast Stamp and Coin in Nanaimo, and watching event coverage to learn from the masters. He earned his 3-0 without the luxury of byes, dispatching Mono-Black, Esper Midrane, and Mono-Red with his Mono-White Aggro deck.


Welcome to the Big Leagues!


  
  
  

 
### The Match


An inauspicious start for Thompson, who had to mulligan his first hand. It got worse as his first threats, [Precinct Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precinct+Captain) and [Boros Reckoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner), were matched by [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) and [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) from Utter-Leyton. Thompson had to pass his fourth turn with nothing more than a scry land, which gave Utter-Leyton an opportunity to play [Jace, Architect of Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) and minus it for cards. Thompson split [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) verus two lands. Utter-Leyton thought for a moment, then scooped the Wrath.

*Josh Utter-Leyton*

Thompson's troubles continued as his next turn was just a [Soldier of the Pantheon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon). Utter-Leyton used up the last of Jace's loyalty to get more cards, then replaced him immediately. He was in total control. Soon he was resolving [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for three while Thompson could only play out lands. [Ætherling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling) hit the table, and a turn later Jace Ultimated, allowing Utter-Leyton a look at Thompson's deck. He noted some surprises - [Archangel of Thune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Thune) and [Heliod, God of the Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%2C+God+of+the+Sun), then took [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) for himself. Thompson, a true gentleman, even provided him soldier tokens with which to defeat him.


### Utter-Leyton 1 - Thompson 0


  
  
  

 
Game two kicked off with another mulligan for Thompson, but at least his deck came off the blocks faster. He led with Dryad Millitant into [Boros Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Elite) into [Boros Reckoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner). Utter-Leyton took a moment on his third turn, before deciding on [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) for the Reckoner. Thompson hit for three more and played another Reckoner, mentally crossing his fingers.


It wasn't a [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), but the [Fiendslayer Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiendslayer+Paladin) that Utter-Leyton put down was enough to convince Thompson to keep his troops home. Thompson played [Heliod, God of the Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%2C+God+of+the+Sun), and passed. With a shrug, Utter-Leyton cleared the board with a Verdict. Thompson passed and empty turn, planning to rely on Heliod for troops. A [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) from Utter-Leyton meant he would only get one. Another [Fiendslayer Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiendslayer+Paladin) for Utter-Leyton was soon joined by [Archangel of Thune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Thune), and the +1/+1 counters started to pile up. Thompson's draws provided no solution, and soon he was extending the hand in defeat.

### The Postgame


Brett Thompson was unfazed by his loss, and eager to move on to the next match. The players exchanged good luck wishes for the rest of the event.


I asked Utter-Leyton about his deck choice this weekend. He was confident in its ability against the expected field. [Assemble the Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assemble+the+Legion) is backbreaking against Mono-Black Control. He said that you can't plan to just answer black's threats, because their [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)s and [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)es will make sure they can land a threat that you don't have an answer for. Instead, you play a threat that trumps their whole deck. I asked him about running [Counterflux](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterflux) over [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve), and he said that the advantage [Counterflux](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterflux) gives in Game Ones of blue-white matches is enormous. The opponent is simply unable to resolve their threats.
