Day 1 Coverage



Welcome to Grand Prix Santiago 2018!


Astonishing, cosmopolitan, and worldly, Santiago is a reflection of a pure spirit and a love of the very best things in life. Between towering skyscrapers, local markets, and shopping streets, you’ll also find expansive museums, top-flight restaurants, as well as stunning views of the Andes mountains. No wonder 40% of Chileans call this capital city home! Almost 800 players - over 260 teams - were in attendance, making this one of the largest tournaments in Chile to date.


Today, we will be engaging in eight rounds of Team Sealed, followed by six more rounds of Ixalan Block Team Sealed tomorrow if you survive the 6-2 cut. After that, a Top 4 cut will take place, and a couple of single elimination Team Drafts will determine the champions of Grand Prix Santiago 2018!
