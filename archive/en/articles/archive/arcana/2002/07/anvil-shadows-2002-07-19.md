Sometimes when cards are reprinted, there are little snafus in the files that no one catches. In the case of the *Chronicles* [Wall of Shadows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Shadows), the victim was its expansion symbol.

[Wall of Shadows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Shadows) originally appeared in the *Legends* expansion, but when it was reprinted, the symbol was accidentally changed to that of *Antiquities*.
