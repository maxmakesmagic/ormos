* [**Thursday, 11:05 a.m.: The Metagame Runaround, Standard Edition**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/10chiba/worlds_1.mp3) (19.8 MB)

* [**Thursday, 8:45 p.m.: Team Time!**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/10chiba/worlds_2.mp3) (11.9 MB)
With six rounds of individual Standard competition gone, it's time for the National Teams to flex their collective muscles, with the first two of their four dedicated rounds this week. There's plenty of points at stake, with teams receiving nine points for a victory, whether it's two matches to one, or a clean sweep. Lose, and you go away with nothing. While the Slovak Republic duked it out with Team America, we step into a classic rivalry featuring the oldest of friends and enemies, Great Britain and France. Storm and Survival, Faeries and Traps, Blue-White and Blue-Black, it's a festival of Greatest Hits, plus we bring you all the news from the Individual contest. Is Brad Nelson still in pole position for Player of the Year?...


* [**Friday, 10:34 a.m.: Largely Limited**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/10chiba/worlds_3.mp3) (6.5 MB)
Draft day at Worlds is the largest simultaneous draft of the year. With no cut to day two, over 350 players sat down this morning to test their Limited skills with the *Scars of Mirrodin*  set, which has proved a highly skill-intensive environment. We scan the tables for the top names, including Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, Brian Kibler, and the U.S. National Champion Josh Utter-Leyton. Infect, Metalcraft, [Furnace Celebration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Celebration), Dinosaurs....it's all here as Worlds goes Largely Limited.


* [**Friday, 7:35 p.m.: K v K, K KO's K, K?**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/10chiba/worlds_4.mp3) (12.9 MB)
While Kopec versus Kibler may not trip off the tongue, it's still a mouthwatering highlight of three feature matches in the penultimate draft round. Mateusz Kopec is the talented Polish player with an Extended Grand Prix win to his name, while Kibler is, well, Kibler. Also in the spotlight are Dave Williams up against Kazuya Mitamura, while U.S. Champion Josh Utter-Leyton takes on Gerry Thompson. The final Limited action of the 2010 season is just a click away.


* [**Saturday, 10:36 a.m.: Teams Throwdown**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/10chiba/worlds_5.mp3) (13.4 MB)
While the main course of Day 3 is the six rounds of Extended action that will determine the Top 8, we begin with two fabulous rounds of team competition. With perennial European top-notch Austria in the mix, we watch them take on the Slovak Republic, anchored by **Magic Online**  star Robert Jurkovic. We begin with chatting to the overall leader, Mateusz Kopec of Poland, and also get to speak with the 10-2 Lukas Jaklovsky of the Czech Republic, and both Jeremy Neeman and Ian Wood of the Australian team. Standard, Extended, Legacy, and a globe full of **Magic**  get us off to the races on Day 3. 


* [**Saturday, 6:45 p.m.: Tasting the Tension**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/10chiba/worlds_6.mp3) (16.6 MB)
Nothing, but NOTHING, beats Round 17 of Worlds every year. The Top 8 is still unknown, plenty of players are facing one last make-or-break effort to end or continue their season. In this final podcast action of the season, we bring you action from each and every one of the matches that matter. Wafo-Tapa, Matignon, Sperling, Froehlich, and Nakamura are just five of the players involved in the most tension-filled hour of the year. Stop reading. Start listening. 


* [**Interview with World Champion Guillaume Matignon**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/10chiba/worlds_winner.mp3) (7.1 MB)
With the 2010 World Championships' dramatic conclusion just minutes old, Guillaume Matignon shares his thoughts on winning the World Championship title and creating a tie for Player of the Year with Brad Nelson. After starting the tournament 3-3, Matignon didn't drop another match en route to the title.
