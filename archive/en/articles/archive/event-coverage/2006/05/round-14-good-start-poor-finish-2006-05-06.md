For readers of the **Magic** website Brainburst, it seems like Paolo Vitor Da Rosa has been writing forever, but in reality he's only an 18-year-old college student from Brazil. He was in contention for a Top 8 slot in Hawaii right up until the last round, and is once again in the hunt here in Prague, proving at least when it comes to **Magic**, he swings both ways. Da Rosa's opponent is the ubiquitous Frenchman Olivier Ruel, who hasn't been outside a Top 8 hunt in the final rounds of a Pro Tour since about the time the Mayflower landed.


### Game 1


The first spell of the game was [Silhana Starfletcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silhana+Starfletcher) from Ruel followed by a [Tidewater Minion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidewater+Minion) a turn later. Da Rosa cast a [Greater Mossdog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Mossdog) on his own turn, casting a [Demon's Jester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demon%27s+Jester) a turn later, but Ruel had [Douse in Gloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Douse+in+Gloom) for it. Ruel's development went exactly according to schedule, but Paolo had been slowrolling [Kindle the Carnage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kindle+the+Carnage), getting a five for three when he discarded [Skarrgan Firebird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skarrgan+Firebird) to the massive burn spell. Ruel's face fell when he saw how poorly fate had treated him, but two turns and two [Coiling Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coiling+Oracle)s later, he had four creatures in play to Da Rosa's two, a [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) and [Sadistic Augermage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sadistic+Augermage). [Gleancrawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gleancrawler) a turn later, however, made the French master squirm a little.

[Gleancrawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gleancrawler) was only able to hit once before Ruel smashed it with [Cytoshape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cytoshape), again  

reshaping the game to his advantage. A swing with the team brought Da Rosa to 9, and Olivier dropped the hammer, casting [Moroii](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moroii) behind it. Da Rosa wasn't done either, taking out most of Ruel's team a turn later with [Pyromatics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromatics) and [Douse in Gloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Douse+in+Gloom) plus a block from [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) on the [Moroii](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moroii). A dredge war of attrition kicked off between the two players as Stinky battled against [Shambling Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) and an [Enigma Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enigma+Eidolon) for Ruel. The battle went on for some time before Ruel's library clock finally won out, and Da Rosa scooped up his cards to head into Game 2 with 30 minutes left on the clock.


Ruel sided in Rise // Fall and [Dimir House Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+House+Guard) between games, saying it was worse for his mana base but better for the deck.


### Game 2


Game 2 in this match wasn't even a game. Da Rosa parised to six and then couldn't find more than three lands, while Ruel curved out, hitting [Coiling Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coiling+Oracle), [Silhana Starfletcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silhana+Starfletcher), [Cytoplast Root-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cytoplast+Root-Kin), [Dimir House Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+House+Guard). A little smashy-smashy, and Da Rosa was once again assured the fear of finishing a win or two short of the Top 8, just like in Hawaii.


Final Result  

Olivier Ruel 2, Paolo Vitor Da Rosa 0
