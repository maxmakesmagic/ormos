*Strixhaven* Season Alternative Play Calendar
---------------------------------------------


Classes are now in session, with guest-lecture alternative play events available weekly. Each of these events begins on Wednesday at 10 a.m. Pacific time and continues for one week unless otherwise specified. *Strixhaven* season ends with the MTGO launch of *Modern Horizons 2* in early June.


* April 21: *Strixhaven* Supreme Draft – Play like a grad student with all the most powerful spells that this esteemed school of mages has to offer.
* April 28: New Spotlight Cube – This Cube will be *pioneering* some new space for us, and it promises to be an exciting new thing to try. As usual, more information on this will be available shortly before the event launches.
* May 5: Emma Handy's *Proliferate Cube* returns – One of the most popular spotlight cubes from 2020 is back with an update. You can *counter* on having a good time for a week in early May!
* May 12: *Legacy Cube* returns – For two weeks, we're reviving a cube that's been dormant for almost a full year. For those of us who love the power level of *Vintage Cube* without the huge spikes that come with actual power, this is the cube to watch for.
* May 26: New Spotlight Cube – As usual for new spotlight cubes, we'll have more information as we get closer.

MTGO Premier Play Update Changes
--------------------------------


We appreciate your feedback regarding the changes to MTGO's Premier Play that were announced last week. Based on that feedback, we are making the following changes:


1. Leaderboard points are now removed from Format Challenges. The intention of leaderboard points and the leaderboard invitations is to reward consistent success in Premier Play. By removing leaderboard points from Format Challenges, players can focus on a smaller number of more important events. We believe that in general, the leaderboard point system is excellent, but it goes too far if it incentivizes playing in more than a dozen events each weekend.
2. The continued success of Legacy and Pioneer shows us that there are enough players to safely increase the minimum player count for their Format Challenges to 64. With this increased player requirement, the prize pool increases as well to match that of Modern's Format Challenges. Full prize schedules are described here: [https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-format-challenges](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmagic.wizards.com%2Fen%2Fcontent%2Fmagic-online-format-challenges&data=04%7C01%7CKendall.Pepple%40c.wizards.com%7C0f07fc509c704a64fd3d08d8ffaa497f%7C701edd3ec7a84789b1ce8a243620d68f%7C0%7C0%7C637540454148300786%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=yWXdrO8SEPAEAGTWr0H1FOXm%2Fz6xVFjh1YUbCuUvzqI%3D&reserved=0).
3. We understand that Limited players are disappointed in the removal of the Limited Showcase path and are exploring ways to offer more Limited Premier Play opportunities.

Showcase Qualifiers
-------------------


Players who earned entry into the Showcase Qualifier will be squaring off for an invitation to the Champions Showcase. The entry fee for Showcase Qualifiers is a format token that matches the format of the Showcase. As with QPs, after the season's Showcase Qualifiers are finished, all unused Format Tokens will be removed from players' accounts. Each Showcase Qualifier is a scheduled Swiss-style event with a Top 8 playoff. The winner of each Showcase Qualifier earns a spot in the final Showcase event and a chance to earn their share of $70,000 and an upcoming Premier Event invitation.


Showcase Qualifiers are scheduled as follows:





| **DATE** | **TIME** | **EVENT** | **FORMAT** | **INVITATION** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

April 21 Patch Notes
--------------------


* [Prismari Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismari+Command) no longer incorrectly requires the opponent to discard two cards.
* Legendary sorceries from *Dominaria* can once again be cast, provided the would-be caster controls a legendary creature.
* [Bartered Cow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bartered+Cow) now properly creates a Food token when discarded. *Moo*.
* Several cards that look at the top card of a player's library will no longer follow that up with incorrectly erasing some cards from the top of that library. Notably, this includes [See the Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Truth).
* Players can now set yields in a game without affecting any other MTGO games they maybe playing concurrently.
* [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) now works correctly with many cards, including [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle), [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone) (and similar cards), [Mystic Sanctuary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Sanctuary), [Harmonic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harmonic+Sliver), and others.
