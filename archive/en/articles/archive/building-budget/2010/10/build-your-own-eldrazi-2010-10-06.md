Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






Last week I wrote about a combo deck that focused on [Myr Galvanizer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Galvanizer)'s interaction with [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin). There seemed to be quite a bit of confusion in the forums in reference to some of the things I said. Most of the confusion surrounded a statement I made about [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) being the only non-burn instant-speed removal spell left in Standard. Many readers were confused by this statement. My point was that [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) would probably be the only non-burn instant speed removal that saw any serious play. It seems far-fetched to me that players would opt to play instant speed removal that doesn't deal with [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel) and the [Titans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Btitan%5D&set=%5B%22Magic+2011%22%5D) when they could easily play a sorcery that could actually deal with the bombs. 

This week I'd like to talk about a new deck that takes advantage of an underestimated enchantment from *Zendikar*. I'm not entirely sure of this deck's origin. I saw different versions of the deck being passed around on Facebook; Mostly by Pat Chapin, so I assume this came from that particular think-tank. Most of those versions played green for creatures like [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and [Fauna Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman). Personally, I feel that a mono-white version of the deck could fare very well in the new Standard. 

Let's talk about the plan!

### Quest for the Argentum Armor

[Quest for the Holy Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quest+for+the+Holy+Relic) has a big qualifier. You have to cast five creature spells to find said Holy Relic that you've been questing for. Luckily for us, there are a number of ways to play five creature spells without even using every card from our hand. Cards like [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) and [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) allow us to dump creatures onto the battlefield to maximize the value of a quick quest for the Holy Relic. Cards like [Kor Skyfisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Skyfisher) and [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) can bounce a zero-cost artifact creature back to our hand and let us replay it to maximize the number of counters we get on our quest. [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) is the obvious all-star in this type of strategy. You'll always net a bit of card advantage with this one. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab111_quest.jpg)  
Activating [Quest for the Holy Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quest+for+the+Holy+Relic) has always been a bit of a stretch. It's a lot of work for not so much pay. After you've gone through the work of casting five creatures you end up netting some random stick that maybe increases your clock by a turn. At best, you were finding a [Basilisk Collar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk+Collar) and sticking it on a [Cunning Sparkmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage). Luckily for us, though, that's all changed with the printing of [Argentum Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argentum+Armor) in *Scars of Mirrodin*. This is the type of Equipment that's actually worth working toward. [Argentum Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argentum+Armor) grants its wearer +6/+6 and targeted annihilation. This deck's best draws are actually unbeatable. It seems pretty unreal to grab and equip an [Argentum Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argentum+Armor) on the second turn and attack to destroy your opponent's land. Even if your opponent has a removal spell for your "build-your-own-eldrazi" you can simply cast a [Kor Outfitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Outfitter) the next turn and put them further behind. 

![Quest for the Holy Relic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Quest+for+the+Holy+Relic)  
Lets talk about the cards I decided to include here. I'd like to look at each card from a strategic standpoint and talk about how it might affect what plays you should make in a given game. 

### Quest Checklist

[Quest for the Holy Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quest+for+the+Holy+Relic) is certainly the most powerful thing that a deck like this can take advantage of. In order to take advantage of this, though, we need to make sure we don't cast too many "do nothing" creatures before we stick our quest. For example, there's no reason to cast an [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) blind on the first turn. It can only end badly for you. Sure, you may want to cast your [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) on the second turn so you have something to return to your hand with your [Kor Skyfisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Skyfisher), but blindly casting a [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) or [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) seems like it never works out. You have to treat the Quest a lot like you would treat [Glimpse of Nature](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+of+Nature) in the older Extended elf decks. Using your expendable creatures to survive to a point where you draw the [Quest for the Holy Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quest+for+the+Holy+Relic) at which point you can dump all the creatures from your hand onto the battlefield and go fishing for some Argentum which will probably win you the game. Remember, your opponent cannot cast a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to deal with the quest activation's equip. You never target which creature will be equippedâ€”if your opponent lets you search your library, he's given up any chance to cast the Bolt before the target gets +6/+6 and you get a free vindicate every turn.

| Ornithopter | Memnite |

[Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) and [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) are easy to cast creatures that work exceptionally well with cards like [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) and [Kor Skyfisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Skyfisher). Cards like this don't normally make the cut. In fact, I would be wary about including these cards in even the most dedicated [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) decks. This deck is different, though. Our goal is a lot more focused than other aggressive decks. We badly want to use our [Quest for the Holy Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quest+for+the+Holy+Relic) and these cards, despite their low power level, are very good at activating the enchantment. The deck also naturally grants some help to these types of creatures. [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) will give us a lot of incentive to play with a reasonable Equipment package. Cards like [Darksteel Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Axe) and [Trusty Machete](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trusty+Machete) can make a kite (ornithopter) into a very reasonable threat. 

![Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stoneforge+Mystic)  
Speaking of [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic). How happy are you that you traded for them as bulk rares when I first wrote about their awesomeness? [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) is a very reasonable backup plan to the normal combo. [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) is mostly known for its triggered ability, but this deck actually makes very good use out of its activated ability too. Dropping an [Argentum Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argentum+Armor) onto the battlefield for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) seems like a pretty nice deal. Getting to the six mana we need to equip may seem like it's pretty tough, but we can even cheat that cost with our [Kor Outfitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Outfitter)s. 

![Kor Skyfisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kor+Skyfisher)  
[Kor Skyfisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Skyfisher) is a very impressive card for its cost. The drawback of having to return a permanent you control back to our hand is actually a very nice advantage in this deck. You can grab another Equipment with your [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) or pick up and replay a zero cost creature for Quest counters. [Kor Skyfisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Skyfisher) can also be used as a one-card activation team for the [Quest for the Holy Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quest+for+the+Holy+Relic). You can use the [Kor Skyfisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Skyfisher) to return itself to your hand. You get an extra quest counter every time you replay it. Skyfisher supplements its reasonable size by being one the best card available for finishing our quests. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab111_hawk.jpg)  
[Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) seems like a perfect fit for a deck like this. We want to cast a lot of creature spells and there has never been a more expendable creature card to cast than the [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk). [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) is quite good in a deck like this. All the Equipment can make hawks that are usually nothing more than a nuisance into some very real threats. This deck does a very good job of turning somewhat random bodies into worthwhile endeavors.

![Argentum Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Argentum+Armor)  
[Argentum Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argentum+Armor) is the goal here. This is probably the most powerful piece of Equipment we've ever been able to fetch up with our Quest. Other cards like [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) or [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) are obviously "better" cards, but when you don't care how much mana it's going to cost you then you may as well go with the [Argentum Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argentum+Armor). 

![Journey to Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Journey+to+Nowhere)  
[Journey to Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) is the premier removal spell of the format. It permanently deals with cards like [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine) while also smacking around the format's heaviest hitters like [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel) and the [Titans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Btitan%5D&set=%5B%22Magic+2011%22%5D). [Journey to Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) also has some nice synergy with [Kor Skyfisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Skyfisher) at times. If your opponent casts a legendary creature then it would probably be wise to use a [Journey to Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) to deal with the issue. When your opponent manages to get a second copy of the Journeyed legend on the battlefield you can cast your [Kor Skyfisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Skyfisher), return the [Journey to Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) back to your hand and kill both copies of the Legend. It's a neat trick that comes up surprisingly often. 

![Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Glint+Hawk)  
[Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) is similar to [Kor Skyfisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Skyfisher) in its applications. It's an extraordinarily aggressive creature and it can often net us multiple creatures in play. Friends have asked me whether I would opt to play a [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) or a [Quest for the Holy Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quest+for+the+Holy+Relic) on the first turn if I was given the choice. I feel that maximizing the number of counters on [Quest for the Holy Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quest+for+the+Holy+Relic) is right more often than not. 

![Kor Outfitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kor+Outfitter)  
[Kor Outfitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Outfitter) can do a lot of work. Reducing the cost of equipping the [Argentum Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argentum+Armor) seems like it could swing a game in our direction a good portion of the time. Normally, [Kor Outfitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Outfitter) lets its caster cheat on one, two, maybe three mana. [Argentum Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argentum+Armor) makes him skill all the way to six, it's pretty impressive when you think about it. Also, it provides us with another body to hold Equipment. 

The Equipment package is pretty important.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab111_3Cards1.jpg)  
I decided that I wanted a pair of [Trusty Machete](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trusty+Machete)s so we could double equip and have cards like [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk), [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic), and [Kor Outfitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Outfitter) all be prepared to survive a hit by a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)

[Darksteel Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Axe) seemed like another solid inclusion here. It serves much of the same function as the [Trusty Machete](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trusty+Machete), the [Darksteel Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Axe) may not grant any toughness, but its indestructibility will help minimize the effect that cards like [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) and [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) may have. 

[Basilisk Collar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk+Collar) is another card that really deserves a lot of press. It's extraordinarily difficult to race a play with an active [Basilisk Collar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk+Collar) on the table. You can even use your [Basilisk Collar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk+Collar) to play a slow game of attacking with one lifelinking flyer. Equipping an expendable blocker with the collar (looking at you [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite)) and passing the turn. It's pretty tough for your opponent to attack into a board like that and you're netting a nice little lifeswing every time your flyer gets to crack through. 

A lot of people on the forums suggested that cards like [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) and [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) would see play in competitive Standard decks. Fortunately, this just isn't the case. Cards like [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel), [Titans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Btitan%5D&set=%5B%22Magic+2011%22%5D), and [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) are so powerful that it seems unreasonable to assume that every person will play some number of cards that you actually want to target with [Disenchant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant) effects. *Scars of Mirrodin* will certainly affect things, but I don't think it's quite like our first trip to Mirrodin where deviation from the most homogenous metagame ever was always punished with poor results. These days, you can play almost anything and have it be competitive. Constructed **Magic** is in a really awesome place right now.

Here's how the deck looks when we do all the numbers.

The sideboard can include a few copies of [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge) and four [Kor Firewalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Firewalker). If you can manage to trade for a copy of [Sword of Body and Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Body+and+Mind), then you could certainly find room for one of those in the main and perhaps another in the sideboard.

This deck has a lot of very exciting draws and it certainly seems very powerful. Next week I'll start playing games again. I'd love to hear what new deck ideas you folks have that work with cards from *Scars of Mirrodin*. I'd like to thank Pat Chapin and any other that may have helped formulate this deck concept, it looks like a lot of fun and it certainly has the potential for competitive play. 

Happy Brewing!
