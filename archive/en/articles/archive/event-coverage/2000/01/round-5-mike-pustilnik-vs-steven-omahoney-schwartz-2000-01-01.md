Mike Pustilnik had a great season last year. He finished third in the pro tour player of the year race. He made two pro tour top 8s and won Pro Tour LA. Pustilnik is known for playing original decks of his own design. He won GP Memphis two years ago and introduced the world to Squirrel-Prison, a deck that dominated the Urza Block Constructed format.


Steven O'Mahoney-Schwartz is a well accomplished pro as well. He won Pro Tour LA two and a half years ago and is well known as one of the tour's most consistent and best players.


Pustilnik played a deck of his own design. It was a blue-red-white deck with [Galina's Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knight), [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel), [Powerstone Minefield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Powerstone+Minefield), and the usual complement of blue broken cards.


O'Mahoney-Schwartz played a new version of Domain created by Brian Kibler. Dubbed "Dark Domain" by some, it plays several cards foreign to domain decks in the past such as [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger), [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), and [Planar Despair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Despair). It also played several of the old classics like [Collective Restraint](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Restraint) and [Global Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Global+Ruin).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPDEN01/122fm5steveo.jpg)Game one passed quickly. O'Mahoney-Schwartz led off by playing three [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere)s. On about the eighth turn, O'Mahoney-Schwartz attempted to [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and Pustilnik responded with his own [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). This tapped out Pustilnik for O'Mahoney-Schwartz to play [Global Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Global+Ruin) on his turn. He followed up with a [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger) and Pustilnik could put up no resistance. 


Game two, Pustilnik's sideboard showed up for him. O'Mahoney-Schwartz's attempts to do anything were denied by a hail of [Aura Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aura+Blast)s, [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay)s, [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb)s, and [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude)s. One [Galina's Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knight) went most of the distance and Pustilnik finished O'Mahoney-Schwartz off with a pair of [Prophetic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Bolt)s.


Game three started very slow with neither player playing a spell for the first five turns. Pustilnik got a [Prophetic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Bolt) to resolve, but O'Mahoney-Schwartz returned with a [Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void) for four that removed a [Crusading Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusading+Knight) and Pustilnik's only other threat, a [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All). The game still remained a virtual standstill after this until O'Mahoney-Schwartz cast [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) at the end of Pustilnik's turn. The ensuing counter-war tapped down Pustilnik so that a [Restock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restock) resolved for O'Mahoney-Schwartz. The [Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void) resolved again, this time for three, taking away all of Pustilnik's counters and [Repulses](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulses). This allowed O'Mahoney-Schwartz to resolve two [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger)s which quickly killed Pustilnik.
