Right after I say that the Message Boards don't predict poll results, you all went and proved me wrong:




| **Which deck do you want JMS to evolve over the next two weeks?**  |
| Black Clock | 2201 | 34.2% |
| Blue Clock | 1787 | 27.7% |
| Green Clock | 1069 | 16.6% |
| Red Clock | 828 | 12.9% |
| White Clock | 558 | 8.7% |
| **Total** | **6443** | **100.0%** |

The silent majority has lined up nicely with the vocal Boards posters. Black Clock, here I come!


Oh, wait.

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swamp)


















 I said last week that I hadn't put a lot of thought into these decklists. Now that I take a good, hard look at the deck, this fact is painfully obvious. I don't know if all five of my decks were this rough, but I know I've stared long enough at these cards to realize I have some work ahead of me.


Here are some of my early observations on the deck without a game under my belt:


The way this deck is trying to take advantage of [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) is twofold. First, it has a lot of discard to eliminate the cards an opponent is keeping in hand as a result of [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock)'s tempo disruption. Second, it uses cheap Spirits in combination with [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) to lower an opponent's life while raising mine. That's it. That's the whole deck in a nutshell, with [Kiku's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%27s+Shadow) as creature removal and [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) as the “finisher,” able to win the game in one mighty swing if the game goes long enough. [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings) acts as almost a fifth and sixth [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope).


There are a couple of tricks embedded in the deck, but not many. For example, I could theoretically bounce my [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) to hand and then channel it. [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) has twelve Spirits to soulshift back into hand, not counting the three [Soulless Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless+Revival)s. Mostly, though, the deck is about playing [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) and making room for it to give my opponent fits while I drain away with [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope).


The cards not in the deck are noteworthy. In no particular order, [Death Denied](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Denied), [Distress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress), [Exile into Darkness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exile+into+Darkness), [Horobi's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horobi%27s+Whisper), [Devouring Greed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Greed), [Psychic Spear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Spear), [Sink Into Takenuma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sink+Into+Takenuma), [Bile Urchin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Urchin), [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter), [Honden of Night's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honden+of+Night%27s+Reach), [Infernal Kirin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Kirin), [Three Tragedies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Three+Tragedies), [Maga, Traitor to Mortals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maga%2C+Traitor+to+Mortals), [Befoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Befoul), [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), and [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague) all look like they might find a home in the deck. I'm sure I had good reasons for leaving these cards out of my original thinking, I just can't recall those reasons a week later. It probably had to do with some sort of dementia brought on by thinking of five decks simultaneously.


The good news is that the deck is consistent. Unlike preconstructed decks, this deck has mostly three and four copies of its chosen cards. This should ensure as reliable a performance as you can hope for in a deck with no mana-fixing and no card-drawing. It's also monocolored, so automatically saves itself from lots of mana headaches. Twenty-four land is always a good starting point for a new deck, so I'm happy with that part as well.


Of course, what I worry about in any deck built around [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) is its survivability. Can I make a game go long enough for [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) to be a factor? Do I need more creature control? Lifegain? Cheap discard? How do I deal with [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte)? [Eight-and-a-Half-Tails](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eight-and-a-Half-Tails)? Dragons? Hondens? [Sosuke's Summons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sosuke%27s+Summons)? How does the deck play if I don't draw [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) ? Right now I don't have good answers to these questions, which underscores what I said earlier about the deck needing a lot of work. It also signals that it's time to start playing.


### Playing With Black Clock


There's something really intimidating about playing a deck of my own design as opposed to an obviously-needy preconstructed deck. Couple that with the fact that late in the Pro Tour Qualifier season means a lot more polished “netdecks” floating around the Casual Decks room, and you have a very nervous JMS. Still, there are a lot of things about this deck that I want to experience instead of think about, so here goes...


*Game 1: Green/Red/Blue Snakes*


 



![Kiku's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kiku%27s+Shadow)

After I mulliganed twice (not off to an auspicious start), I had a first-turn [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker), with three Swamps and a [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings) in hand. The Stalker got in one hit before [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and [Sosuke's Summons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sosuke%27s+Summons) tokens appeared. I put out [Ashen-Skin Zubera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen-Skin+Zubera) to block, while [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need) fetched [Seshiro the Anointed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seshiro+the+Anointed) for my opponent. It was all downhill from there as he swarmed me with beefy 3/3 Snake tokens. I was really cursing [Kiku's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%27s+Shadow) in this game and its inability to kill Seshiro. [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) did make an appearance, but my opponent was ahead and could just take two damage a turn with no problems.

*Game 2: Green/Black/White Good Stuff*


The best way that I can describe my opponent's deck was that he used really good cards from three colors, including [Cranial Extraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction), [Final Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Judgment), [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree), and [Patron of the Kitsune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Kitsune), setting it all up with a base of [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), and [Tendo Ice Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendo+Ice+Bridge). I had another quick Ghost-Lit Stalker and a fourth-turn [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) , but he used [Splinter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) (!) on it the following turn. After that I made him discard his hand, multiple-blocked the Kodama to kill it, and chump-blocked his Patron for about six turns before it finally killed me. [Kiku's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%27s+Shadow) again mocked me from my hand.


In case you were wondering, this is sort of a nightmare start to figuring out if my deck can use [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) or not.


*Game 3: Black/Blue Wisdom deck*


 



![Measure of Wickedness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Measure+of+Wickedness)

SkipAIM had a very cool deck, with various Soratami dudes, [Neverending Torment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neverending+Torment), [Jushi Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jushi+Apprentice), [Descendant of Soramaro](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descendant+of+Soramaro), [Exile into Darkness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exile+into+Darkness), and [Measure of Wickedness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Measure+of+Wickedness). I got stuck on two land for two turns, which put me way behind on the tempo game. Still, I eventually started warring with him over his own hand size, with an active [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) and [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare) making him discard. [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) hit the table, and the Clock sent him down to around ten life while I kept at my discard. I finally hit a stage where I could start recycling [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings), but I didn't have a blocker for his fliers and was low on life thanks to [Measure of Wickedness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Measure+of+Wickedness). I died, with [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) finally doing its duty but too late and with me unable to capitalize on it.

*Game 4: White/Black Samurai*


For some reason I've seen a proliferation of White/Black Samurai decks around the Casual room. Luckily for me, my opponent didn't get off to much of a beatdown start. I had yet another quick [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker), who attacked while my opponent had land and Sensei's Divining Top. [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare) came next for me, followed by [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock). [Sensei Golden-Tail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei+Golden-Tail) tried to stand in the way, but I had [Kiku's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%27s+Shadow) (finally useful!). My opponent conceded at eight life after bouncing his own Top to hand for three turns. Whew. I was starting to envision an 0-5 start there.


*Game 5: Monoblack Spirits*


This game was comical. He had a quick [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba), and I had a quick [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba). He had a [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), I had a [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). He had a *second* Thief of Hope, I had Waking Nightmare. After awhile we got to a situation in which he had three Thieves to go along with [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) and a [Cruel Deceiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Deceiver). I, meanwhile, had three Thieves (no kidding) and two [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna). As one spectator noted, “There's a lot of thievery going on, and not a lot of hope.”


The difference was that I had [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings) coming back each turn, dashing four life from him and adding four to mine while my opponent was in topdeck mode. He eventually found a [Devouring Greed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Greed), dropping me to three and putting him back to twenty. It didn't bother me, though. I just kept plugging away doing my thing until he conceded. Ironically, on my last turn I drew [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock).


### In Praise of Damnation


Okay, 2-3 is what I've come to expect from these first five games. The first three were brutal losses, though, and the deck feels very underwhelming right now. Time to make some changes:


*OUT:* 4 [Kiku's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%27s+Shadow)


My original reasoning, I'm sure, for adding [Kiku's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%27s+Shadow) over [Horobi's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horobi%27s+Whisper) was that a) a lot of people in the Casual Decks room use Black, and b) [Kiku's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%27s+Shadow) is superior removal. Maybe both of these reasons are still valid and I'm pulling the trigger on the Shadow too soon. If I face another non-Black creature with toughness greater than its power I'm going to punch my screen, though, so I'm currently feeling that drastic action is in order. I still think [Kiku's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%27s+Shadow) is great removal, but I should have at least *tried* arcane creature removal before switching to the Shadow.


*IN:* 3 [Horobi's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horobi%27s+Whisper)


So in comes arcane removal. I still worry about those instances where I'm facing an opponent with Black creatures, and I worry that dropping down to three copies is way too little removal for my poor, slow deck. My reasoning is that I will often be able to splice a Whisper (although I use my graveyard a little, there should be plenty of expendable cards in there). That's the theory, anyway, and worth a try. It's nice to have instant-speed removal and a way to gain life at instant speed via the Thief.

*IN:* 2 [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations)
RoBear on the Message Boards said, “There are some cool cards that could work in this [Black] deck as well. [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) combined with [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) makes both choices harder.” Wait. Back up. [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations)? I had completely forgotten about that card when I put my initial decklist together, but RoBear is exactly correct. This is the card that gives my opponent essentially the same choice as [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) but on a much bigger scale. Combined *with*  [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock), I think the two can be a deadly duo. [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) is even arcane, so it triggers [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). Wow is that neat. Of course it's rare, but it currently falls into the “cheap one ticket rare” category. Since my deck isn't using any other rares at the moment other than the Clock, I'm willing to shell out for them. If I can figure out the mana problems, I can easily see adding more than two copies to the deck.


That's five cards in and four cards out. I have to trim somewhere and the best place seems to be:


*OUT:* 1 [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare)


I like that [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare) hits an opponent for two cards and that it's arcane. In my mind this makes it better than the cheaper [Distress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress) and [Psychic Spear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Spear) for my deck. It's the one bit of discard in the deck, though, that becomes absolutely useless once my opponent's hand is empty. Since one thing I've proved to myself is that my deck can empty an opponent's hand, I don't see the necessity of loading up on a full four copies.


Here's my new Damnations-ful deck:

Let's see if I have any more success given these changes...


*Game 6: Monowhite Spirits*


Thank you RoBear. I again got stuck on two land while my opponent played [Kitsune Diviner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitsune+Diviner), [Ghost-Lit Redeemer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Redeemer), [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku), [Moonlit Strider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonlit+Strider), [Lantern Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+Kami), [Kabuto Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabuto+Moth), and [Nikko-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nikko-Onna). All I could muster was two [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) and an [Ashen-Skin Zubera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen-Skin+Zubera). So I got smashed, right?


Nope.


I eventually hit a pocket of land in my deck. I used [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare) to get rid of his last two cards in hand, including [That Which Was Taken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=That+Which+Was+Taken). Then on five mana I played [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna) to give me some blocking power. Then a sixth land, and I played [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations). My opponent's choice? ZERO. I don't think he read the card carefully, and I know it wasn't much of a choice for me. I really hoped to draw [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) after that, but instead I got [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) to get rid of whatever cards he drew while my critters crept over the now-empty side of the table for the win.


*Game 7: Black/Red Aggro*


This game was over before I blinked. My opponent got down [Raving Oni-Slave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raving+Oni-Slave), then [Bloodthirsty Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre), then [Manriki-Gusari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manriki-Gusari) on the Ogre, then [O-Naginata](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=O-Naginata) on the Oni-Slave. I had a [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) ('natch) and [Ashen-Skin Zubera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen-Skin+Zubera) as speedbumps, plus a [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare) to dump his two [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter)s. I played [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock), he took two damage, and that was game. Ow.


*Game 8: Black Hand*


 



![Sickening Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sickening+Shoal)

This one played a lot like the previous game, but with slightly less brutality. I had two [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker)s and a [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare) to my opponent's [Ogre Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Marauder) and [O-Naginata](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=O-Naginata). I was ready to block when he used [Sickening Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Shoal) on my untapped Stalker, so I took a hit to the face. I played a third Stalker, able to block this time. But my opponent had a [Raving Oni-Slave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raving+Oni-Slave). The 6/3 trampling meanie hit me down to two life. I drew and played my sixth Swamp, playing [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) and hoping my opponent would misread the card like my Game 6 opponent. No such luck. He took seven damage down to eight life and cruised in for the win.

*Game 9: Five-Color Enduring Ideal*


Although my opponent conceded because of needing to get to a draft game, I'm going to log this game because it was interesting and extremely long. I had the ever-present [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) start, then [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). I actually forget how he was able to kill my [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), but it died and I found myself playing the discard-before-you-can-get-going race. I successfully got him into topdeck mode, but he managed to play [Lifegift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifegift) to match against my two [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock)s. He kept gaining and losing life, hovering around sixteen, while I tried to do something--anything--to hurt him. [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings) pinged away, and two [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) stared down his [Genju of the Fields](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genju+of+the+Fields) and two [Ghostly Prison](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Prison)s. I don't know why he wasn't bouncing his Genju and Sensei's Divining Top, but I wasn't complaining. I also wasn't complaining that he couldn't find [Enduring Ideal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal) or any Honden. Eventually he found [Honden of Infinite Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honden+of+Infinite+Rage), but I had used [Soulless Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless+Revival) to bring back my [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). He dipped around ten life, then around seven. He kept digging for Ideal and I kept praying for [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations). Eventually, as I said, he conceded when he had about twenty-five cards left in his library and was down to five or so life.


*Game 10: Green/Black Snakes*


 



![Seshiro the Anointed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Seshiro+the+Anointed)

This was an incredibly frustrating game only because it started so well and had so much potential. I had [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba), followed by [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and another [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) followed. My opponent played [Sosuke's Summons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sosuke%27s+Summons) and [Manriki-Gusari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manriki-Gusari), but otherwise was just sitting there taking damage from [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) and my Thieves. I got stuck on four land for a few turns, which meant I couldn't play [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna). Then I got stuck on five land without an ability to play [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations). Why was this important? Because my opponent ended the game at five life, a billion tokens, and [Seshiro the Anointed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seshiro+the+Anointed). Ugh. Not having a sixth land is infuriating when my new card would have won me the game.

### Swamp, Meet Forest


That's 2-3 again, but I'm feeling more optimistic. So, after ten games, what have I learned?


* My deck is vulnerable to super-speedy decks.
* My deck is slow (which may be a key reason why it's vulnerable to super-speedy decks).
* I get mana-shy way too often for a monocolored deck with twenty-four lands, probably because I'm relying on cards towards the top of my manacurve.
* The Casual Decks room *is* flooded with Black. Luckily, I never draw a single [Horobi's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horobi%27s+Whisper). Ever.
* I have a mystical ability to draw [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) in every opening hand.
* [Ashen-Skin Zubera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen-Skin+Zubera) doesn't do much except give me a chump-blocker. It feels like I can do better than that.
* [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) are the only two reasons I can make [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) a hard decision for my opponent. Luckily, they like each other and I like them both.
* [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings) doesn't suck, but it's often too little too late.

That's a lot to learn after only ten games. I'm going to set some of those observations aside and chalk them up to randomness. What is particularly troubling are the first three points, all of which are related. My deck can lose fast because it has very little defense. My deck is slow. I can't seem to generate enough mana for what I want to do. Those are three killer indictments for a deck.


I've tossed it around in my mind, and I can't see any way around them in Monoblack. I could add [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter)--and still may, eventually--but run a serious risk of killing [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). I could add land, but I'm only addressing the mana-shy problem, not the speed of the deck. With [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) such a critical (and, let's be honest, cool) card in the deck, I need to get access to mana acceleration. [Honor-Worn Shaku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor-Worn+Shaku) does not solve my deck's problems.


I've analyzed my weaknesses and don't see a way my core color can handle them. Time to dip into a second color. And by “dip” I mean take a running leap and do a cannonball into a second color. Yes, I think my limitations in Black are that severe. This will also lead to a violation of the “five card” guideline, but I don't see any way around it when you do something as drastic as add a second color to a deck. I'll try my best to keep a tinkering approach after that.


Now, let's see. What color is good at accelerating mana in Kamigawa Block Constructed? Hm. Wait a minute. I almost have it...


*IN:* 4 [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)


*IN:* 4 [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach)


This is a “typical” mana-acceleration suite for a KBC (Kamigawa Block Constructed) deck running Forests. The difference between how it usually works in most decks and how it works in mine is that right now I'm not worrying at all about other Green cards. That is, my deck is going to still be mostly-Black, with Green added for the sole purpose of accelerating my mana. This decision may seem a bit artificial since you might think other Green cards should go in the deck, but right now I'm only adding cards that specifically solve my deck's problems. Those problems are speed and mana. Elder and Reach are my solution.


Anyway, I've said enough about these cards in my [Kamigawa Commons Review](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/jm99). It sort of stinks that [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) isn't a Spirit until I remember what a phenomenal tool he is in decks of every kind.


Now, what eight cards to drop for my new color?


*OUT:* 4 [Ashen-Skin Zubera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen-Skin+Zubera)


 



![Ashen-Skin Zubera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ashen-Skin+Zubera)

As I said, this guy is the only creature that has thus far underwhelmed me. By adding Green I have the option to look into [Dripping-Tongue Zubera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dripping-Tongue+Zubera) as well. This also opens the door for [Devouring Greed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Greed), which is obviously good with my deck. That starts to look like a pretty typical Spirits deck, though, and not a [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) deck. Rather than take up eight or more slots on a bunch of 1/2 blockers, I would rather accelerate to my [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) and [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations). Besides, [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) is arguably a better blocker than [Ashen-Skin Zubera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen-Skin+Zubera).

*OUT:* 1 [Soulless Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless+Revival)


I'm not sure if this will stay [Soulless Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless+Revival) or become [Death Denied](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Denied) since I never splice it. In either case, I think the creature count is low enough to warrant only two of them. In my deck the Revival serves a very specialized purpose, and could read “Return target creature card named [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) from your graveyard to your hand” and I would still use it. This signals to me that either I need better creatures or, more probably, that I can survive with fewer copies of [Soulless Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless+Revival).


*OUT:* 1 [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings)


As I said, it's a cute, worthy trick but it's also slow and mana-intensive. I'm keeping one now because I enjoy playing it so much, and I still like the idea of having effectively more than four [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) in my deck. This is one of my deckbuilding quirks that's uncommon: I often throw in a single copy of a card that I enjoy using and puts a smile on my face even if it's slightly underpowered or overcosted because it enhances my own play experience to draw it. It's sort of like every **Magic** game is a lottery, and when I draw [Death of a Thousand Strings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Strings) I win.


*OUT:* 1 [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker)


 



![Ghost-Lit Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker)

This is a tougher call, since I'm not usually a fan of using three copies of a one-mana creature. I'm especially not a fan since I always seem to draw and play it on the first turn, and right now my deck doesn't have anything else to do on that first turn. The problem is that I usually only care about [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) once [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) is on the table or I have five mana. In either of these cases, it's one of those “I want one, but I don't need more than one” sort of cards, which is exactly the situation in which I prefer three copies. You could make an argument, in fact, that playing it on the first turn so often is a bad sign since it's so relatively useless in the early game.

I'm also dropping a land to twenty-three on the assumption that the Green I've added will give me the mana I need. Of course, having only eight Green cards and making them so critical to play early puts my mana base in a precarious situation. Where is [Bayou](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bayou) when I need it? Or maybe [Tainted Wood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Wood)? [Llanowar Wastes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Wastes) from *Ninth Edition*? Heck, I would even use [Pine Barrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pine+Barrens) right now. Oh well.


*OUT:* 11 Swamp


*IN:* 10 Forest


Here is how I'm going to approach it from a testing perspective. As you can see, I'm tilting the mana more heavily towards Forests given the total number of Green cards in the deck because those cards will both find Swamps and accelerate me to my higher-cost spells. The only card this really hurts is [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba), but I like the idea of Akuba as a finisher much more than an early-game creature for this deck anyway.


That puts my deck here:

No, the name doesn't fit anymore. That just means you'll get a chance to suggest deck names after the final installment and see if you can dethrone [DoubleNegative](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/interlude-budget-saviors-2005-08-01).


*Game 11: Blue/Red Ire of Kaminari deck*


This game was beautiful, albeit too short. I had a second-turn [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba), third-turn [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), fourth-turn [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock), fifth-turn [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), sixth-turn [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), seventh-turn [Soulless Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless+Revival) back a [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) that had died to [Spiraling Embers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiraling+Embers), then replay my Thief. My opponent conceded after that. [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) was a beast in this game, since when I cast it all my opponent had was three land in play and was already on the defensive. He took two life once, then was forced to bounce a land for three turns in a row. Splice decks don't like limiting their resources. The fact that he was pointing [Spiraling Embers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiraling+Embers) at my 2/2 creatures--with half the time me returning one via soulshift--was a nice sign, too.


*Game 12: Green/Red Spirits*


 



![Kemuri-Onna](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kemuri-Onna)

A nice guy, I got started with a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) while he had [Traproot Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traproot+Kami). I then played [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) while he got another [Traproot Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traproot+Kami) and an [Okina Nightwatch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Okina+Nightwatch). I gained some life before he killed my Thief with [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray), then I spliced [Horobi's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horobi%27s+Whisper) onto [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations). He went down to five permanents, and I started recurring [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna) with a bunch of topdecked Spirits and arcane cards. Eventually I found another Thief, then [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock), and I could stop worrying about attacking while slowly winnowing his life and blasting any cards in hand. He eventually found [Kami of the Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+the+Hunt), then [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) for my Thief (which brought back [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba)). With my opponent at eight life, I started going into attack mode, dropping all of my creatures for a blitz attack. Two attacks plus [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) finished the game, with [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) dealing lethal damage. How often does *that* happen?

Oh yes. I'm liking Green quite a bit.


*Game 13: Monowhite Spirits*


Of course, there is the flipside of playing mana acceleration. My opponent announced that he was on a very light budget and had made his deck for about two tickets (the equivalent of two dollars). He came out of the gates with [Lantern Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+Kami) and [Kabuto Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabuto+Moth) while I had [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) and [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). When he cast [Jade Idol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jade+Idol), I knew I was in trouble because my hand consisted of five land and [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach). I eventually played [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) to get him down to four permanents (he had nine). The problem was that those permanents were [Jade Idol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jade+Idol) and three land. Another [Lantern Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+Kami) followed another [Kabuto Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabuto+Moth) while I continued to draw land. By the time I was twenty-one cards deep into my library, I had twelve land on the table and four in hand. Ouch. Like I said, the flipside of playing mana acceleration is the danger of mana-flooding.


*Game 14: Green/Red Spirits*


 



![Kodama of the North Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree)

Ah, how can I be upset at losing to this deck? We both had second-turn [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s, but he followed it up with a [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need) for [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree). I got a [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), but it died to [Ghost-Lit Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Raider). His Kodama hit the table and started pounding at me while I attacked his hand and played a second [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). Another [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need) fetched [Jiwari, the Earth Aflame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jiwari%2C+the+Earth+Aflame), and down went my guys while Kodama went bam, bam, bam to my head. I played [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) to drop him to five permanents, then made him discard his remaining two cards (both [Ghost-Lit Raiders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Raiders)), but I had no way to deal with his 6/4 trampler. I again had way too much mana in this game, ending with something like twelve land on the table. Mana-flooding strikes again.

*Game 15: Blue/Red Spirits/Arcane*


His deck was interesting, using some Spirits to go along with [Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant) and many of the usual [Ire of Kaminari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ire+of+Kaminari) cards ([Ideas Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ideas+Unbound), [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray), cheap card drawing). Anyway, he got a [Shimmering Glasskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimmering+Glasskite) on the table along with [Kiri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiri-Onna) to bounce my [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). I found five mana and played [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna), which slowed him down and started to eat into his hand. The Thief gave me some needed life while I played [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) and a second Thief. Now my deck was humming. I had [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) in hand, but I didn't want to give him the [Kiri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiri-Onna) outlet, so instead I kept attacking his hand and gaining life via my Thieves. He bounced both back to my hand, but ran out of cards and sat there at four life. I had Kemuri-Onna on the board and seven land. I played [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations), then he sacrificed all but three land (hoping to draw some burn, I suspect, since I was at six life). He drew his card and then conceded, facing my 3/3 attacker and two Thieves coming into play next turn.


I love, love, LOVE [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations). It is, I think, the perfect complement to Blood Clock.


*Game 16: Monoblue Spirits*


It's cool how many different sorts of decks I'm seeing. I had a near perfect start going first. I got a first-turn [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker), second-turn [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), third-turn [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock). On my fourth turn I bounced the Stalker, played another land, then replayed my Stalker and added [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) number two. My poor opponent was caught with three Islands and a [Floating-Dream Zubera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Floating-Dream+Zubera). He bounced his Zubera and took two damage for a while while I started bouncing my Stalker and [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna) every turn. We did that until I drew [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). I played my Thief, then [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) and my Stalker. At six life, four land, and a [Secretkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secretkeeper) on the board, my opponent conceded.


*Game 17: Monowhite Samurai*


 



![Konda's Hatamoto](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Konda%27s+Hatamoto)

Everything was looking fine, me getting [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) while he got [Konda's Hatamoto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%27s+Hatamoto) and some Plains. Then I played [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock), feeling very good about myself. Then he played [Terashi's Grasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terashi%27s+Grasp), and I didn't feel so good. Then he played [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) and I felt even worse. I realized suddenly with a pang that I had no way to deal with Jitte maindeck, so I threw some chump-blockers in the way, played both [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) to drop him to five permanents, then ten life. After that I decided to die to a fork-wielding Hatamoto.

*Game 18: Red/Green Fatties*


This game was fairly straightforward. He got a [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami) equipped with [Tenza, Godo's Maul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tenza%2C+Godo%27s+Maul). I blocked and killed it with [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna) (sped along by [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach)). Then I attacked his hand but his one card left was [Fumiko the Lowblood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumiko+the+Lowblood). Fumiko killed my [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), then started attacking for six damage a turn. I played two more Reaches to get a mess of land, praying for a [Horobi's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horobi%27s+Whisper) to save me. Instead, my opponent played [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree). Yeah, that killed me.


*Game 19: Black/Red/Green Fatties*


I'm actually not sure quite what his deck was up to because he had an all-Mountain start while I had [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba), [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba). That's obviously sort of a beatdown draw, so when he played Razorjaw Oni it only helped me while I kept my Elder back to block. I was really vulnerable to [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter), but he used *Champions'* dual lands and kept tapping down his black mana. He then started playing [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach)es of his own, but it was too late to save him. Not a very satisfying victory, since I played neither [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) nor [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations).


*Game 20: White/Blue Fliers*


 



![Floodbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Floodbringer)

I got a quick start with [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), putting [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) and [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) into play while my opponent had [Floodbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Floodbringer) and three land. I bounced my little fella, then played [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and a second [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock). Then the game got interesting. My opponent had his [Floodbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Floodbringer), plus three land, [Soratami Rainshaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soratami+Rainshaper), [Harsh Deceiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harsh+Deceiver), and [Kira, Great Glass-Spinner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kira%2C+Great+Glass-Spinner). I had [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), the two Clocks, and a bouncing Stalker and [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna). He would bounce a land and [Floodbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Floodbringer) every turn, attacking for four. I would bounce my two Spirits and play land, bringing me back up two and dinging him. I then played a third Clock once I had plenty of land, then [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba). The game was now desperate for him. Although he dropped me to seven life, then six, I could gain three back a turn and he was starting to go down fast. He eventually played [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami) and sent everything in, putting me at one and making me block with my Stalker. The next turn I won with [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) damage. The game went long and was totally dependant on [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) for the win. As one spectator said afterwards, “that game should be bronzed.”

6-4 and things are looking up. Again, what have I learned after ten games?


* My deck is prone to mana-flooding.
* My deck can't deal with [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree).
* My deck can't deal with [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte).
* My deck has a hard time with fliers.
* [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) and [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) are real skill-testers for my opponents.
* I love the Green acceleration.
* I still love [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) and [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope).
* I'm a little dubious of [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) because it seems like the only true beatdown card in the deck.
* I haven't drawn [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings) once since dropping to a single copy.

That's where I'll pick up in the final installment. I'll say right now, though, that those are much gentler lessons than after the first ten games.


### A Note On Daughters


A final note before I sign off today. This Thursday is my wife's due date for our second child (a girl this time). Heck, the baby may already be here by the time you're reading this since I submit my articles several days in advance. Why is this important to you? The hope is that I won't miss a beat and you will see the final installment of my [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) foray next week as scheduled. Depending on the day of delivery, though, the final installment may come in two weeks instead. If you're anxious to see the finale, keep your fingers crossed not only for an easy delivery, but for a deadline-friendly delivery as well.


Think hard and have fun,
