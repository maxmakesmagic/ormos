It came not in the form of a noble struggle, a fair contest of warriors clashing will against will, but as a wave of unstoppable slaughter. Mirran partisans resisted bravely, using their wits and magic to fend off the onslaught that originated from inside their own world. 

But their efforts were for naught. Phyrexia is victorious. Mirrodin now goes by a different name: *New Phyrexia*. 

 New Phyrexia will be available in the **Magic Online** store on May 30. The New Phyrexia prerelease will feature three separate parts: Swiss Sealed Flights, 8-Player Swiss Draft Queues, and Casual Drafts. See below for more information.
