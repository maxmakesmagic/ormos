The *Ravnica* legend **[Tolsimir Wolfblood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolsimir+Wolfblood)** can tap to put his faithful friend, the intelligent wolf Voja, into play, and grants the token a +2/+2 bonus to boot.


As with any other card that creates tokens, art was commissioned for the Voja token for ***Magic** Online*.
