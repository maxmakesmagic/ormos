This week's "Sketches" looks at that saucy red sorcery from *Scourge's* Decree cycle, [Decree of Annihilation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Annihilation). The concept for the cycle of Decrees was that these super-spells were cast by [Karona, False God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karona%2C+False+God) herself, and so their effects -- and art -- had to be huge, bold and awesome. Responsibility for the red Decree was put in the hands of **Magic** art veteran John Avon.


### 1. Art Description


These were the instructions given to the artist:


"Location: Skirk Ridge  
 Action: Show the goblin dwellings and their possessions, etc., burning and burning *badly* in the shadow of Karona. This is the fire that brings the 'END OF THE WORLD' and the end of all that is living to the goblins."


### 2. Sketches


Here is a preliminary sketch of [Decree of Annihilation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Annihilation) submitted by John.


This quick sketch shows [Karona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karona) herself floating in the center of the chaos wreaked by the spell, surrounded by suggestions of the goblin dwellings.


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of the final piece. In this final version you can see how [Karona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karona)'s presence is now just an ominous shadow cast on the rock face in the foreground. John has also added plenty of elements to represent the spell's all-consuming blaze and the correspondingly hopeless goblins.


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as you can see it in booster packs.
