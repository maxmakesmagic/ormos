### Collector's Highlights


For the first time ever, the *Mercadian Masques* expansion includes randomly inserted foil-finished premium cards and premium basic lands—now you can compete with an all-premium deck!




### Game Features


When **Mercenary** and **Rebel** cards hit the table, you can search through your deck for others every turn. Can you say "uninvited guests"? And the new **Spellshapers** toss the four-card limit out the window—transform any card in your hand into the spell you need.

It’s like topdecking the card you need, any time. 


Featuring 350 all-new, black-bordered cards, the *Mercadian Masques* set is sold in four theme decks, 75 card tournament packs, and 15-card booster packs. 


***Mercadian Masques*. Instant gratification.**
