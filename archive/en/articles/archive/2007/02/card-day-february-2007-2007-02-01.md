**Card of the Day - mercredi 28 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Contract%20from%20Below)#### Contract from Below


 *Limited Edition Alpha* rare. Contract from Below is a longtime staple of Vintage combo decks, restricted due to its ability to refuel a deck for a winning turn. Powerful as it is, Contract – appropriately enough – does not come without its risks, particularly in a fully powered Vintage deck. In a key game at the 2006 Vintage Championships, Nick Trudeau, in the middle of going off with his Tendrils combo deck, Contracted for a new hand – flipping up Black Lotus as his ante and nothing relevant in his other seven and putting him in the unenviable position of losing money on his Top 8 finish. What is 'What If?' Week?  
  
It's "What If?" Week here on **magicthegathering.com**, and in the spirit of *Planar Chaos*, we're presenting you with a variety of "What If?" alternate reality scenarios. Some of them, like Mark Rosewater's column, explain the premise up-front; others, like Kelly Digges' feature article, encourage you to figure out the "What If?" on your own. Ask Wizards and Card of the Day are in on the fun as well, containing implied "What If?" questions, but Arcana is "normal" – we didn't feel alternate reality scenarios would play well in that format. Thanks for reading, and enjoy "What If?" Week!
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 27 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shadowmage%20Infiltrator)#### Shadowmage Infiltrator


 *Odyssey* rare. Designed by Jon Finkel, winner of the 2000 Invitational, Shadowmage Infiltrator combines a black evasion ability with the (then solely) blue Ophidian ability – a potent combination. During *Odyssey* development, it was realized that another card in the file – also costed at ![1 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif)![Blue Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/blue_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif) – might overshadow the Invitational winner's creation, and the card was cut from the set. Given the obvious power of U/B "Finkel" decks in Extended, however, it's hard to imagine a better creature for the cost. What is 'What If?' Week?

**Card of the Day - lundi 26 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Richard%20Garfield,%20Ph.D.)#### Richard Garfield, Ph.D.


 *Unhinged* rare. Richard Garfield, Ph.D. allows its controller to play Mental **Magic**, an ability that's powerful in the extreme in the hands of an experienced player who knows the cards. The card's power was proven at Pro Tour – Easter Island (The "Un-" Pro Tour) in 2005, when a deck featuring "the Doc" narrowly beat out a Mox Lotus combo deck in the Finals. The real Dr. Garfield was also in attendance, keeping busy all weekend signing copies of his namesake powerhouse. What is 'What If?' Week?

**Card of the Day - vendredi 23 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Polar%20Kraken)#### Polar Kraken


 *Ice Age* rare. Pale Bears, also in *Ice Age*, was originally called Polar Bears, but the name was vetoed – depending on who you ask, either on the basis that Dominaria has no poles (not true) or on the basis that at the time the poles were not appreciably colder than the rest of Dominaria (true). Whatever the reason, it kept the word "polar" off of Pale Bears, but not off of Polar Kraken.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 22 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shivan%20Meteor)#### Shivan Meteor


 *Planar Chaos* uncommon. The design version of Shivan Meteor dealt 20 damage, fully double the previous printed damage record held by Urza’s Rage and Searing Wind. The decision was made to play around in the space between 10 and 20, saving the big two-oh for (perhaps) another day. And maybe, just maybe, somebody on the Development team had a soft spot for Autochthon Wurm.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 21 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Battlewise%20Aven)#### Battlewise Aven


 *Judgment* common. Although the race/class model did not yet exist, the Aven were concepted as a race of sentient birds, and therefore it made sense that each of them would have a “job” type in addition to Bird – any of Soldier, Wizard, and/or Cleric. The Nantuko were similar in being a race of mostly Insect Druids, with the occasional Insect Shade, Insect Spirit, or Zombie Insect thrown in.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 20 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mangara's%20Tome)#### Mangara's Tome


 *Mirage* rare. From Nevinyrral’s Disk to Jayemdae Tome, early Magic names were riddled with word plays and hidden references. The most common and robust of these was the anagram, with such golden examples as Sol Grail (“gorillas”) and Wyluli Wolf (“Wyluli” scrambles as “Lily Wu,” the name of Richard Garfield’s wife). The character Mangara was named as a parody of this trend – as an anagram of “anagram.” 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 19 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Nether%20Shadow)#### Nether Shadow


 *Limited Edition Alpha* rare. Though haste has become largely associated with red, Nether Shadow was actually the first creature that could attack the turn it came into play. "Can attack on same turn summoned or returned to play" became "unaffected by summoning sickness," which was eventually keyworded as haste.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 16 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fact%20or%20Fiction)#### Fact or Fiction


 *Invasion* uncommon. Though justifiably infamous for game-ending card-advantage haymakers, particularly in concert with Psychatog, Fact or Fiction also presented many opportunities for misdirection – on both sides of the table. Fact or Fiction in response to a spell might lead the opponent to put a counterspell in the smaller pile… allowing the Fact or Fiction player to grab the larger pile and stop the spell with a counter already in hand. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 15 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Counterspell)#### Counterspell


 *Limited Edition* Alpha common. Counterspell was an iconic fixture of the game for so long that its name is often used as a generic term for any spell that counters another. Though it was last printed in Seventh Edition, it remained the benchmark for counterspell effects until the printing of Cancel in *Time Spiral*, when it went the way of Lightning Bolt and Control Magic – and the sight of two untapped Islands across the table is just a little less scary. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 14 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lightning%20Storm)#### Lightning Storm


 *Coldsnap* uncommon. Lightning Storm breaks several major "rules" at once. In addition to being the only spell with an activated ability, it's one of only twenty cards whose Oracle text refers to the stack - and of those, it's one of only seven to do so outside reminder text. Of those, only *two* were originally printed that way (along with Mirari and Radiate, which were retemplated along the way). 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 13 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cursed%20Scroll)#### Cursed Scroll


 *Tempest* rare. Cursed Scroll was designed to have a mini-game feel, with a built-in moment of tension as its controller activates it and hopes to pull the named card. Like many such cards, of course, it was at its best and most efficient when the mini-game was rigged. Thus, most memories of Cursed Scroll involve not fun and tension, but repeatable burn to the face. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 12 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Akroma,%20Angel%20of%20Fury)#### Akroma, Angel of Fury


 *Planar Chaos* rare. Although it was obvious that an alternate-reality Akroma would be a fun and splashy addition to *Planar Chaos*, and equally obvious that the new version should sport an equally ridiculous salad of abilities as the first one, there were several iterations of the exact abilities involved. At one point she had flash and split second, but when flash was removed, split second no longer seemed like a good fit. It was replaced with "can't be countered," and morph was added later in the process.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 9 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Disenchant)#### Disenchant


 *Limited Edition* Alpha common. Although edged out by Stone Rain (and, say, the basic lands) for total number of times reprinted – and eventually supplanted in the core set by Naturalize – Disenchant has nonetheless appeared in six expansions and every core set up through *Seventh Edition*, as well as in promo versions, starter products, and boxed sets. Its place on the *Time Spiral* timeshifted sheet will keep this longtime staple in Extended into the next decade.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 8 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Storm%20Seeker)#### Storm Seeker


 *Legends* uncommon. *Legends* uncommons were divided into Uncommon A and Uncommon B, and due to printing problems, only one set of uncommons appeared in any given box (yes, *box*) of *Legends*. Because one set of uncommons contained a number of cards that were very popular at the time – Storm Seeker, Spirit Link, and the patently insane Mana Drain – opening boxes of *Legends* was a case (so to speak) of feast or famine.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 7 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Propaganda)#### Propaganda


 *Tempest* uncommon. Flavor text is most often used to add flavor to the card it's on and fill out details about the setting in which it appears. Sometimes, more frequently in previous storylines than current ones, flavor text has been used to drive home an important moment in the story. The flavor text from Propaganda packs a lot of substance into a small amount of text.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 6 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fog)#### Fog


 *Limited Edition* Alpha common. Fog was tied for many years for the title of shortest card title in **Magic**, and even now there are only 16 cards in **Magic** with three-letter names (half of which are split cards, silver-bordered, or both). *Unglued*, of course, presented an opportunity to make an even shorter title, Ow, and *Unhinged* could not resist trumping that with \_\_\_\_\_, a card with no title at all.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 5 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fork)#### Fork


 *Limited Edition* Alpha rare. Fork is one of a small subset of cards that have been restricted in Vintage and later unrestricted. Though the versions of Fork do not agree whether to “double,” “duplicate,” or “copy” the target, its Oracle template is somewhat complicated by the fact that Fork retains its color. Still, it’s one of the lucky wordy Alpha cards whose template has gotten shorter with modern templating rather than longer. Clockwork Beast, for instance, isn’t so lucky. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 2 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sinew%20Sliver)#### Sinew Sliver


 *Planar Chaos* common. The cycle of mono-colored 1/1 Slivers in *Tempest* were all named after body parts (Clot, Heart, Muscle, Talon, and Winged), based on the original concept that the Slivers were literally fragments of a single being. While that idea fell by the wayside, the names were retained with a different concept underlying them. When Muscle Sliver was timeshifted for *Planar Chaos*, it was decided that it should have a body part in its name that could have slotted nicely into the original cycle. Thus, Sinew Sliver.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 1 février 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Primal%20Plasma)#### Primal Plasma


 *Planar Chaos* common. Primal Plasma is the only *Planar Chaos* timeshifted card whose original version (Primal Clay) was an artifact, but that wasn¹t always the case. Bottle Gnomes also spent some time in the design file as a white creature. Ultimately, white Bottle Gnomes didn¹t make the cut simply because white can do better in the life-gaining weenie department (Aven Riftwatcher, for instance, is arguably superior).
