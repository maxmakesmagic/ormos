Day 1 Coverage



As the reigning World Magic Cup champions, the Japanese are looking to send yet another stellar trio to the 2018 World Magic Cup. Today, over 800 aspirants converged in Shizuoka for their chance to make the national team, making it the largest Nationals in Magic history.


Competitors will engage in seven rounds of Standard and six rounds of Booster Draft before the Top 8 cut. After the elimination rounds, the National Champion and the finalist will join Japan’s Pro Point leader (at the moment, Ken Yukuhiro) to create Team Japan.


If you’re interested in jumping in on some of the action, head over to [ww.twitch.tv/mtgjp](http://ww.twitch.tv/mtgjp) for live Japanese coverage, or watch the timeshifted coverage (with English commentary) at [www.twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) after coverage of Grand Prix Detroit concludes!
