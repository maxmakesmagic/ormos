### *Innistrad* Block Constructed

Block formats have a significantly smaller card pool than Standard. They tend to be about half as large. As a result, it is easier for a strong deck or strategy to go unanswered, as there are fewer potentially competitive strategies.

The DCI examined the current block format and found that creature-token based strategies were dominating and largely competing with other creature-token based strategies. In particular, [Intangible Virtue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intangible+Virtue) and [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) were very prevalent. There were some variations to the base white-black deck. One could add green mana, which adds [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township), gives [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=245288) flashback, and allows the option of [Garruk Relentless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Relentless). One could add red mana, which adds [Hellrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellrider) and [Devil's Play](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devil%27s+Play). However, this isn't the diverse format most people enjoy.

In the interest of making *Innistrad* Block Constructed a more diverse and healthy format, the DCI is banning [Intangible Virtue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intangible+Virtue) and [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls).
