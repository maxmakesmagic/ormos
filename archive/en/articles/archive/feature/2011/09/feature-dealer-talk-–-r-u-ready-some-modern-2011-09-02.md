For dealers, trying to stock cards for a new, untested format can be a bit tricky. For every surefire popular card like [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) or [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), there is a whole slew of [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor)s being discovered by pros looking to break Modern wide open.


While much of the talk leading up to the tournament has been centered on decks based around casting [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) with [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)-copying [Vesuva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva)s, dealers found themselves stocked full of the Locus and clone lands but struggling to keep up with demand on such platinum hits as [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor), [Disrupting Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupting+Shoal), [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal), [Shivan Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), and even [Brooding Saurian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brooding+Saurian).



![Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Peer%20Through%20Depths&options=)

Dealers from one end of the Marketplace to the other at *Magic* Weekend Philadelphia were all reporting that cards from blue-red combo decks were proving to be extremely popular. [Desperate Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ritual), [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths), [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon), [Magus of the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon), [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach), [Disrupting Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupting+Shoal), [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), and [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker) were all in high demand.


Exactly what flavor of blue-red combo would prove popular this weekend could be tough to say, as [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) ([Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) and Kiki-Jiki), [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach), [Hive Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Mind), [Dragonstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstorm), and [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath) have all received attention in the run up to Modern's main-stage debut.


And while dealers reported that [Vesuva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva)s have not been particularly popular, a number of cards meant to fight against the mana monstrosity spawned by Locus lands have shown that players still have the matchup in mind.


The moon effects—of the [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) and [Magus of the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon) variety—both punish greedy mana bases and make life difficult for the [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) player. [Bribery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery), best known for its role in every blue Commander deck ever, has made the jump to the world of 60-card decks as a way to steal [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn)s lurking in opponent's libraries.


But that doesn't mean [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) decks haven't found ways to fight back. [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor) has gone from casually untapping [Dimir Aqueduct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Aqueduct)s on kitchen tables to speeding up the big mana decks by a full turn or more. Since [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor) is a triggered ability, every additional one stacks, meaning a single [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) can generate tons of mana on the turn it enters the battlefield if it has a few other Loci to key off of. It doesn't much matter if they have [Bribery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery) if you're attacking with a 15/15 before they have a chance to cast it.



![Brooding Saurian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Brooding%20Saurian&options=)

But even if they do manage to steal a raging Eldrazi, some forgotten *Coldsnap* tech is giving green [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) players hope in the form of [Brooding Saurian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brooding+Saurian). Not only is the 4/4 for 2GG a beater in its own right, but if [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) does happen to get stolen, the Lizard has no problem taking it right back.


A few other cards have shown glimpses of decks outside the combo versus [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) metagame. [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) and [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) give players a number of ways to find and resolve [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast) for various Persist shenanigans, and dealers reported each of them was selling well.


[Whipflare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipflare), Affinity's [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) of choice, has seen some movement alongside [Glimmervoid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmervoid), showing that, even with the banning of the five colored artifact lands, the artifact menace could be a force to be reckoned with.

Finally, [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal) and [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) have made their presence known among deals for some of the more off-beat decks. [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) has a number of uses ranging from finding [Protean Hulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk) in [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) decks to finding [Regal Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regal+Force) in Elf combo decks, but its coolest, least-fair use might be combining with [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal) to kill players on turn two in a deck that may or may not have been what Mark Rosewater had in mind when he brought back poison.


The deck looks to cast an early [Glistener Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf), [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent) or [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), search up a [Reaper King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+King) or [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus)—both of which have a converted mana cost of 10 and are both red and green—and then exile it with [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal) to inflict a quick eleven poison as early as turn two. Don't count out the fastest kill in the format!
