For many players, making the cut from Day 1 to Day 2 of a Grand Prix is an accomplishment in of itself. But there's a step further that a few claim every event: Remaining undefeated through the first half. While going 9-0 or 8-0-1, for 27 or 25 points respectively, isn't a guarantee of a Top 8 slot by any means it is one of the stones that can be laid down in the groundwork of a Grand Prix victory.


Going into the round there were seven players playing for a possible 8-0-1 record. Three emerged to claim it: Hugo Terra playing an aggressive four-color deck, Kit Chinlund playing a strictly two-color white-green machine, and *Magic Online* Community Cup contender Tom Ross with his double [Ghostfire Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostfire+Blade) four-color deck. With less than half the undefeated decks represented, it's clear there's a stunning diversity in what makes a good deck great enough for a lossless day of Sealed.


In the battles to achieve a truly astonishing 9-0 Day 1 finish, five emerged from the smoldering battlefield: all three of Gabriel Rogasner, Jason Southworth, and Dominic Ceresani rallying the Mardu to their cause; Ian Farnung outlasting with the Abzan; and Daniel Reyes with an aggressive Jeskai crew.





*Dominic Ceresani could both go wide with [Bloodsoaked Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodsoaked+Champion), multiple copies of [Ponyback Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback+Brigade), and a [Trumpet Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trumpet+Blast); or set up a turn of the tides with [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) and [Deflecting Palm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflecting+Palm).*
