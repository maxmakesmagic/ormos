 Portland, Oregon is easy to get around. It is laid out in quadrants, with the Willamette River forming the boundary between east and west, and Burnside Street/Burnside Bridge forming the boundary between north and south. The Grand Prix-Portland venue is the [Oregon Convention Center](http://www.oregoncc.org/), located in close-in NE Portland, within sight of the Willamette River and SW Portland’s downtown skyline. The Oregon Convention Center can be located at a distance by its distinct pair of glass spires.


The main north-south highway through Portland is I-5, which runs from Canada to Mexico, passing through Seattle, Portland, Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Diego on the way. Through Portland, I-5 runs approximately parallel to the Willamette River, crossing the river just south of downtown. I-405 is a half-circle that wraps around the west side of downtown Portland with terminus points at I-5 (I-405 meets I-5 at the north end of downtown at the Fremont Bridge and at the south end of downtown at the Marquam Bridge). A dozen other bridges connect the east and west sides of Portland via surface streets. I-84 connects downtown to the airport and continues to Eastern Oregon and Idaho.


Public transportation in Portland is extremely accessible, with light rail (MAX), street cars and buses connecting most points of interest in the city. There is a direct MAX line from the airport to the Grand Prix-Portland venue and there is free MAX access from the venue to downtown Portland hotels and restaurants. 


**Directions by Car**
  
**From I-5 Northbound:** Take Exit 302A (Rose Quarter, Broadway/Weidler Street Exit), go right on Weidler, and right on Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. 


**From I-5 Southbound:** Take Exit 302A (Rose Quarter/City Center Exit) go across Broadway, then left on Weidler, and right on Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. 


**From I-84 Westbound:** Take Exit 1 (Lloyd Blvd.) stay on Lloyd Blvd. all the way to the Convention Center.


**From the Portland International Airport (PDX)**
  
 Take I-205 South to I-84 West   
 Exit I-84 at Lloyd Blvd (Exit 1)   
 Stay on Lloyd Blvd. all the way to the Convention Center


**Parking at the Convention Center**
  
 If you are coming by car, you can park at the [onsite parking garage](http://www.oregoncc.org/directionsandparking/parking/) for less than $10 a day (rates vary by day). There is additional paid parking on street and at other lots within walking distance of the venue. 


**Travel by Plane**
  
[Portland International Airport (PDX)](http://www.flypdx.com/) is located 20 minutes east of downtown Portland. For what it's worth, Conde Nast has named PDX America's best airport three times running. The food is good and the wi-fi is free. More importantly, it can be reached by major airlines including: Air Canada, Alaska, American, Continental, Delta, Frontier, Hawaiian, Horizon, Jet Blue, Seaport, Southwest, United and US Airways. Rental cars are available at PDX from Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise and Hertz.


[Portland's light rail (MAX)](http://www.trimet.org/schedules/maxredline.htm) provides a direct line from the airport to the Grand Prix-Portland venue (Oregon Convention Center) with service every 15 minutes from 5am to midnight. The MAX line continues across the river into downtown Portland with stops at or a short walk from many area hotels. MAX fare from the airport to downtown is $2.30. [Taxi and shuttle service](http://www.portofportland.com/PDX_Grnd_Trnsprtn.aspx) is also available from PDX; depending on traffic, expect to spend 20-40 minutes and $25-45. 


**Travel by Train or Bus**
  
 Amtrak and Greyhound serve Portland from most major US cities. Both stations are located in NW Portland, with light rail (MAX) and bus service available from the stations to hotels, restaurants and the Convention Center.


**Travel by Bicycle**
  
 Hey, it's Portland. Yes, there are bike racks at the Convention Center. Yes, you can take your bike on public buses and light rail (MAX). Yes, designated bike lanes are available on most bridges and major roads. For more details, [click here](http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/index.cfm?a=70221&c=34809).


**Things to Do in and Around Portland**
  
**Eat:** Portland has more restaurants per capita than any other US city. Google whatever style of food you are in the mood for and you will find a well-loved restaurant dishing it up. We can't cover everything here, but check out the following sites for recommendations: 
 * [Budget Eats](http://www.portlandfoodanddrink.com/reviews/dining-on-a-budget-in-portland/)
* [Fine Dining](http://www.portland-oregon-magazine.com/best-restaurants-in-portland/)
* [Food Carts](http://www.foodcartsportland.com/)
* [Happy Hours](http://www.urbandrinks.com/happyhour/usa/or/portland)
* [Willamette Week Readers Poll](http://wweek.com/editorial/3240/7863/)
* [Citysearch](http://portland.citysearch.com/find/section/portland/restaurants.html)

**Drink:** Portland is a mother city for US microbrews. Portland's oldest microbrewery, BridgePort, is located in the Pearl District. If you want to develop your own pub crawl, add in stops at [Portland Brewing Company's Taproom](http://www.macsbeer.com/), [Widmer Brothers Gasthaus](http://www.widmer.com/) and/or any of the pubs operated by the [McMenamin Brothers](http://www.mcmenamins.com/). 


Portland also boasts a great coffee tradition – coffee lovers should particularly look for locally-roasted [Stumptown Coffee](http://www.stumptowncoffee.com/) which is carried at many local establishments. Wine lovers can sample Oregon wines at local restaurants.


**Browse:**
[Rose City ComicCon](http://www.rosecitycomicon.com/) will be running alongside Grand Prix-Portland at the Oregon Convention Center September 10-11. Portland, home to Dark Horse and numerous indies, is second only to New York City as a center of US comic book publishing. 


Portland is also home to the world's largest bookstore – [Powell's City of Books](http://www.powells.com/) at NW 10th and Burnside. With more than 1.5 million new and used books on the shelves, they hand you a map when you walk in so that you can find your way out again. Techies will also enjoy Powell's Technical Books annex three blocks east of the main store. 


**Bike/Kayak/Hike/Windsurf/Ski/Camp:** Oregon is home to the great outdoors. Bike and kayak rentals are available a short distance from the Grand Prix venue. Hiking is possible within city limits (Portland's Forest Park alone boasts 75 miles of wooded hiking trails). Excellent windsurfing is an hour's drive away at Hood River, skiing is less than an hour's drive away at Mt Hood, and camping is available throughout Oregon and Southwest Washington at state and national parks. If you plan to extend your trip to Oregon beyond the three days of the Grand Prix, you may want to take in some of these outdoor adventures.
