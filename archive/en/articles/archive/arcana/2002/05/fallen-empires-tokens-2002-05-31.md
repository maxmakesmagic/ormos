*Odyssey* may have pushed token creatures to the forefront of tournament **Magic**, but the biggest set for tokens (and counters) was probably *Fallen Empires* from 1994. There were so many cards that produced tokens and/or required counters that we issued a cardboard sheet of them in *Duelist* #4.


Included on the sheet were 0/1 Thrull tokens (for [Breeding Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pit)), 1/1 Camarid tokens (for [Homarid Spawning Bed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Homarid+Spawning+Bed)), 1/1 Saproling tokens (for the myriad [Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid)s), 1/1 Goblin tokens (for [Goblin Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warrens)), and 1/1 Citizen tokens (for [Icatian Town](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icatian+Town)).


To make bookkeeping even more of a headache, the sheet also had Time Counters (for [Tourach's Gate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tourach%27s+Gate)), Net Counters (for [Merseine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merseine)), Javelin Counters (for [Icatian Javelineers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icatian+Javelineers)), Credit Counters (for [Icatian Moneychanger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icatian+Moneychanger)), Tide Counters (for [Homarid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Homarid)), and Spore Counters (for all the [Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid)s). But wait, there's more! The sheet also had +0/+1, +1/+0, +1/+1, +1/+2, +1/-1, +2/+1, +2/+2, -0/-1, -1/-0, -1/-1, and -2/-2 counters that worked with everything from [Dwarven Armorer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Armorer) to [Ebon Praetor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ebon+Praetor), some of which had no relevant cards associated with them at all.


And those weren't all the counters referenced in the set! [Hollow Trees](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hollow+Trees) used Storage Counters. [Delif's Cube](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delif%27s+Cube) used Cube Counters. [Thelonite Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thelonite+Monk) used some sort of nameless counter. You can be sure that R&D won't be making any more sets with quite as convoluted a system of tokens and counters anytime in the near future.
