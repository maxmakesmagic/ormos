### How has Journey into Nyx changed the Sealed format?



![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/events/2014/gpatl14/duke_qh.jpg)***No. 1 Ranked Player Reid Duke**: "I think the format's a little more balanced, a little slower, and a little weaker since *Theros* was the strongest booster. Whenever you add another set, it makes the gameplay more challenging since there's a higher number of tricks and possibilities.* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/events/2014/gpatl14/dezani.jpg)***No. 2 Ranked Player Jeremy Dezani**: "I think white is worse now. White was the best color when you had a lot of *Theros*. With *Journey into Nyx*, it's not the best color. Now I think it's green."*

I think when it was all *Theros*, the format was extremely powerful. Now I think the decks are a little slower and a little clunkier, and the cheap heroic aggro decks got a lot worse."*
