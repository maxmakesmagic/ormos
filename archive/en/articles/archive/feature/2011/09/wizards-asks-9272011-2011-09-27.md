*Got any fun stories from the Innistrad Prerelease?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** At the *Innistrad* Employee Prerelease here at Wizards, I was playing against Digital R&Der Dave Guskin in a just-for-fun game after the main event, with **Magic** R&D director Aaron Forsythe watching.


Dave was threatening serious damage with a [Midnight Haunting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Haunting) Spirit token wielding [Demonmail Hauberk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonmail+Hauberk), but I had a board littered with creatures, including [Rampaging Werewolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampaging+Werewolf), [Howlpack of Estwald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howlpack+of+Estwald), and two 1/1 Wolf tokens with deathtouch courtesy of [Garruk, the Veil-Cursed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+the+Veil-Cursed).

Garruk was at 3 loyalty counters, enough for his -3 "ultimate" ability, and that had Dave worried. He grabbed Garruk, read him, and shook his head in relief. There weren't any creatures in my graveyard!


Aaron listened to this exchange with interest, then watched with increasing impatience as I tried to figured out how to win. Then—because it was a late-night, just-for-fun game—he couldn't resist stepping in. He counted up all my creatures' power and announced:


"You've got him dead on the board."


"Thanks, Aaron!" cried Dave sarcastically.


I shrugged and started turning my creatures sideways, but Aaron stopped me.


"No," he said slowly. "You have to activate Garruk's ultimate first."


And that's how I (or, well, Aaron) won a game of **Magic** by zeroing out [Garruk, the Veil-Cursed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+the+Veil-Cursed) to activate his ultimate and give all of my creatures +0/+0... and trample.
