Draft evolution is highly set dependent. How your strategies, pick orders, and main decks change over the course of a tournament season depends on what the dominant strategy is, how deep it is, and how viable other modes of winning are.


In *Magic 2015* Draft, it became apparent early that white was a reckoning force. [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) + [Sanctified Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctified+Charge) + Weenies quickly became the gold standard. But Draft is a self-correcting format. When too many players are picking those golden cards, other colors and cards emerge. Now that we're close to the end of *Magic 2015*, as Khans of Tarkir approaches on the horizon, how do the pros factor in the token menace when they sit at the draft pod? I grabbed some players in between rounds to find out.


Hall-of-Famer elect No. 13 Paul Rietzl initially resisted the idea that this format distinctly evolved much, especially considering his personal playstyle. For him, each draft format evolves similarly. "The more experience you have, the less you try to force anything and the more open you are to going with the flow." He continued, "I'm a real bread and butter drafter—few tricks and a low-low curve. I try not to out think myself." Although he conceded, "I say that as I'm playing a single Plains in my deck [for his [Sunblade Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunblade+Elf)]."


But the more we talked, the more he realized the specific evolution within himself. "Early on, you try to force convoke or whatever, but you learn to play what you're given." And certain colors and color combinations go up in value accordingly. Rietzl has drafted a lot more Black-Green in the last month than before, which is likely due to the most important discovery in the evolution of the format, [Festergloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festergloom). "I maindeck that card now, and I definitely did not before." The best way to combat early aggression and even mid-game [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits), [Festergloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festergloom) is a complete beast in the format, thanks to the strength of White. And its true importance wasn't felt until the format had be "figured out."

When I talked to No. 2 Owen Turtenwald, he refined that statement further. "Well, it was always good, we just didn't know it." He said, "I mean, you'd draft it because it was a good sideboard card anyway," but now people realize it's much more than that. I caught up with Owen alongside [Limited Resources](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Limited+Resources)' Marshall Sutcliffe and two-time Grand Prix winner Ben Seck. They all had unique input on the issue.



Sutcliffe said the evolution folds back on itself in an interesting way. "Later in the format, people fear that [the best strategy] will be over-drafted. They try to go one level above by not drafting it." But he said that backfires, benefiting the people downstream instead. "If I get fed a [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) and a [Sanctified Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctified+Charge), I'm going into white. I'm all in." The three laughed. "Overthinking it can be a big mistake."


Owen added to that, "It's because they think with too many white drafters they'll be stretched too thin. But white is really deep. Stretched-thin white is still good." He said, "Your neighbor might be taking the [Oreskos Swiftclaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oreskos+Swiftclaw), but you can take the [Kinsbaile Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Skirmisher)." Sutcliffe said that although he liked red initially in the format, it was that exact depth of white that made it so overwhelmingly powerful.

"People think white's the best because it is the best," Owen added.



Ben Seck brought up the other side of the evolution: the status of the "bad" colors or unsupported archetypes. "Anyone taking Black-Red is not a good thing." All the data on *Magic 2015* shows that Black-Red is the worst performing archetype by far. The subpar creatures don't pair with the removal as they can in other formats, mostly because the convoke mechanic encourages decks to have more and more creatures, so the individual removal becomes less effective. Accordingly, cards that were initially valued very highly in their colors, change as their playable archetypes shrink.


"Yeah, Black-Red just can't win," Owen chimed in. However, Seck continued that this idea goes to the individual cards as well. [Undergrowth Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undergrowth+Scavenger) seems powerful in the abstract, but it only takes a few drafts to see that Black-Green Self-Mill is a hard archetype to draft. But that, again folding back on itself, stops people from drafting a powerful card. "I think people undervalue [Undergrowth Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undergrowth+Scavenger) just as an individual card—if you're trading off creatures back and forth it's solid."


Owen vehemently disagreed. "Nope. No. It's just awful. Most of the times people are playing it, it's usually a mistake." However, Owen agreed with Seck that the early evaluations that the Mill deck was too hard to get leaves it undervalued. "Don't actively draft it. But if it comes to you, it's definitely a thing you can do." In other words, if you've got it, flaunt it.


Marshall echoed this Producer's line of thinking. "Once you know what you know, you take what's given to you." That's the common line among all the pros. The most important aspect of a draft format's evolution, regardless of the power of any one color or strategy.


Like Rietzl said—and it's usually good to take his advice—the more you know, the less you have to force anything. If you know that black is a little weaker, if you're getting passed the black, just be sure to pick up [Festergloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festergloom)s earlier than you would have at the beginning of the format. And for Pharika's sake, put at least one in your maindeck.


The spirits seem oppressive, but are certainly beatable. But remember, if they're coming to you, sometimes it's better to join them than beat them.
