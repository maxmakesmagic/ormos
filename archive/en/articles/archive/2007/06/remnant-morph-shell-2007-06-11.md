*Future Sight's* [Zoetic Cavern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zoetic+Cavern) has a unique perspective among cards with morph. Although many morph creatures depict [the morph shell](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1191), [Zoetic Cavern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zoetic+Cavern) shows what it might be like on the *inside* of a morph crawler! When it's face down, it would look like just another 2/2 "morph spider," indistinguishable from an [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) or even a [Whetwheel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whetwheel). Once you see it face-up, the morph shell has become a *location* instead of a creatureâ€”the hollowed-out shell, empty of life, forms an eerie, organic cave. Check out the full art below, in which you can see the organ-like structures of the cavern.
