Earlier in the day, I overheard a conversation between Thomas Enevoldsen and another player who asked Enevoldsen when he would be traveling to Sydney for the Pro Tour. Enevoldsen had no choice but to admit that he wasn't actually qualified. Which came as quite a surprise to the person asking.


After all, the Dane had been part of the winning team at the World Magic Cup two years ago and won a Grand Prix the year before. But, due to work commitments, Enevoldsen hadn't been able to reach any level in the Pro Club this season.


Yet. In fact, Enevoldsen could still change that. He had finished in the Top 4 at Grand Prague last month and now found himself at twelve Pro Points. A finals appearance here in Stockholm would turn that into 18 points, the requisite amount for the Silver Level. Not that that was anywhere near the front of Enevoldsen's mind. He needed to concentrate on the task at hand: drafting a strong deck.


For his first pick, Enevoldsen considered [Selfless Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Spirit), [Prey Upon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon), [Haunted Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Dead), and [Drownyard Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drownyard+Behemoth), eventually settling on [Haunted Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Dead). His second pick was [Alchemist's Greeting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alchemist%27s+Greeting) over [Imprisoned in the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imprisoned+in+the+Moon), then came [Dusk Feaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+Feaster) over [Stensia Innkeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stensia+Innkeeper).

For his fourth pick, he again had a few blue options in [Wretched Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Gryff) and [Curious Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curious+Homunculus), but since the pack contained [Galvanic Bombardment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Bombardment) too there really was no need to venture into another color.


The same wasn't true, however, for pick five. If Enevoldsen had wanted to pick a black or red card here, he would have needed to stoop quite low indeed to pick up [Wailing Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wailing+Ghoul) or [Prophetic Ravings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Ravings). Instead, he looked elsewhere. Blue offered [Laboratory Brute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laboratory+Brute) or [Drag Under](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drag+Under), green offered [Ulvenwald Captive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulvenwald+Captive). Enevoldsen took the latter.


Next, he took [Stensia Innkeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stensia+Innkeeper) over both [Mournwillow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mournwillow) and [Geist of the Archives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+the+Archives), and the rest of the pack gave him: [Swift Spinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swift+Spinner), another [Stensia Innkeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stensia+Innkeeper), [Woodland Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Patrol), [It of the Horrid Swarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=It+of+the+Horrid+Swarm), [Crop Sigil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crop+Sigil), and [Succumb to Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Succumb+to+Temptation).


During the review period between boosters Enevoldsen moved cards he was potentially willing to play to the front of his pile: There were three black, four red, and four to five green cards … The next pack would have to decide which of these to play.


Enevoldsen opened [Bloodhall Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodhall+Priest), but dismissed the two-color card in favor of one of the red contenders: [Smoldering Werewolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smoldering+Werewolf) and [Savage Alliance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Alliance). He thought for a while, then went for the Alliance.


Next came [Murder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murder), which he took over [Stromkirk Occultist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Occultist) and [Haunted Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Dead). So it appeared, Enevoldsen would be drafting black-red after all. He then took [Olivia's Dragoon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Olivia%27s+Dragoon) over [Geist-Fueled Scarecrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist-Fueled+Scarecrow), then [Stromkirk Occultist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Occultist) over [Weaver of Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weaver+of+Lightning).


The rest of the Eldritch Moon gave Enevoldsen [Falkenrath Reaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Reaver) and [Skirsdag Supplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirsdag+Supplicant), as well as relatively late copies of [Boon of Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+of+Emrakul), [Borrowed Hostility](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borrowed+Hostility), and [Borrowed Malevolence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borrowed+Malevolence), as eighth, tenth, and eleventh pick respectively.


With the colors figured out, Enevoldsen's draft finally entered smoother waters. His first pick in Shadows over Innistrad was [Scourge Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+Wolf) over [Spiteful Motives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiteful+Motives), second pick was [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper), curiously enough over [Scourge Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+Wolf), third pick was [Heir of Falkenrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+Falkenrath), fourth pick was [Tooth Collector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+Collector) over [Call the Bloodline](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+the+Bloodline).


Black and red appeared to dry up somewhat though. Enevoldsen only got [Hound of the Farbogs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hound+of+the+Farbogs) fifth, followed by a more respectable [Bloodmad Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodmad+Vampire) and a less respectable [Vessel of Malignity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vessel+of+Malignity). But it wasn't that Enevoldsen was in the wrong colors or anything. For his eighth pick he even had the choice between [Kindly Stranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kindly+Stranger) and [Crow of Dark Tidings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crow+of+Dark+Tidings), taking the former, and [Spiteful Motives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiteful+Motives) went all around the table and joined his draft pile as pick number nine.


The rest of Shadows over Innistrad was disappointing again. Still, it was enough. Enevoldsen had escaped this distinctly difficult draft with something quite reasonable. While he said he wasn't exactly happy with the deck, he was definitely relieved …
