Affinity is everywhere! Before Friday, the predictions poured in -- Affinity will be 60 percent, or 65 percent, no, make that 70 percent of the field. But as the day dawned and decklists were checked, a mere (myr?) 42 percent of the field played Affinity. Apparently that means 58 percent are running anti-Affinity or anti-anti-Affinity decks.



![Rude Awakening](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rude+Awakening)

[Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) splashing [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt), green-red and Big Red filled out the next 35 percent of the field, with [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) wanting to get matchups versus any of the non-Affinity decks in the field because it struggles so much in every first game against Affinity.


One of the hot cards this weekend has been [Rude Awakening](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rude+Awakening). Turning lands into surprise attackers gives both the [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) and various control decks a fast kill mechanism.


Monogreen [Beacon of Creation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Creation) decks are showing up in small numbers. The deck uses [Beacon of Creation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Creation), artifact destruction, and [Blasting Station](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasting+Station) to try to break the metagame. Player-of-the-Year contender Gabriel Nassif is running a [Beacon of Creation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Creation) deck in his pursuit of the title.


Manuel Bevand is one of only three players are playing blue-white with a splash of red Cogs. Bevand went 6-0 in the Standard portion so his deck choice Friday is noteworthy. The Cog deck uses [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines), Auriok Salvager and Aether Spellbomb to deal with Affinity. In other matchups, it plays out as a control deck trying to keep the Salvager in play for massive card advantage.


Stay tuned to see which decks go undefeated! Will Affinity remain on top or will Worlds crown a new king of *Mirrodin* Block Constructed?
