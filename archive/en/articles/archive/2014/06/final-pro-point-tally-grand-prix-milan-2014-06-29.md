Throughout the weekend, we several times took a look at the Pro Point standings of some of the players in attendance and how their point totals may be affected by the event. Now it's time for a final tally. Five players' totals were significantly changed.


These were their standings before Grand Prix Milan:





|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Name:** | **Current Season Points Total:** | **Points from Grand Prix:** |
| Jérémy Dezani | 66 | 6, 5, 5, 4, 3 |
| Patrick Dickmann | 39 | 8, 2, 2, 1, 1 |
| Anssi Alkio | 28 | 2 |
| Ivan Floch | 27 | 4, 2, 2, 1 |
| Jamie Parke | 27 | 4, 3 |


And these are their standings after Grand Prix Milan:





|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Name:** | **Current Season Points Total:** | **Points from Grand Prix:** |
| Jérémy Dezani | 71 | 8, 6, 5, 5, 4 |
| Patrick Dickmann | 40 | 8, 2, 2, 2, 1 |
| Anssi Alkio | 31 | 3, 2 |
| Ivan Floch | 32 | 5, 4, 2, 2, 1 |
| Jamie Parke | 29 | 4, 3, 2 |


Also, Nico Bohny deserves a quick mention. He went from 26 to 32 points, but since he's not qualified for the upcoming Pro Tour and won't travel to Boston for the Grand Prix this doesn't change the fact that he'll end the season on the same level he already had before the tournament: Silver.
