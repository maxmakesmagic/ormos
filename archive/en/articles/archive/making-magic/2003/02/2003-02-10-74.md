Yet another perk of this job is that you get to interact with Richard Garfield on a regular basis. While Richard is no longer involved in the day-to-day upkeep of **Magic**, he still keeps his toe in. You’ve had the pleasure on being on three different design teams with Richard (*Tempest, Odyssey,* and *Judgment*) and you find his insight into the game (his game, mind you) very enlightening.


Richard comes to us from time to time with an idea. Some end up as single cards. Some end up as entire mechanics. Today Richard shows you a card that requires some time to think about. Richard’s ideas usually require some time to digest.


You tell him thank you and chitchat for a few minutes about other things.
