![Jenna Helland](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/Dossier_Jenna_Helland.jpg)**Name:** Jenna Helland

**Job Title and Duties:**
**Magic** Creative Designer  
 I work on world building, card names and flavor text. More specifically, I was on the names/flavor team for *Morningtide*; I did work for the *Shadowmoor* anthology (see [Doug's article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/db26) today); I assisted Doug as Flavor Deputy for *Eventide*; and I was on the world-building team for "Rock." I also help proof text for grammatical accuracy.

**Age:** 33

**Education:**   
 B.A. in history from Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.   
 M.A. in journalism from University of Missouriâ€“Columbia

**When did you start playing Magic?**
*Tempest* Block

**Began working at Wizards:** Has it been a year already? It went lightning fast.

**Previous job(s):** Journalist. Mainly I wrote articles about state fairs, starving artists, and weather. 

**How you got your job here:** I was living in mid-Missouri and playing a lot games. I saw a job posting for writer/editor on the Wizards boards. I emailed a resume, interviewed, and got the job. The only hitch was the wall o' ice we ran into in Wyoming during our drive across the country. 

**Previous responsibilities within the company:** I do editing and creative work for the [**Maple Story** iTCG](http://ww2.wizards.com/maplestory). I've also worked on [Axis & Allies Miniatures](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=ah/aa/welcome).

**Favorite part of your job:** The folks at Wizards are the most interesting and intelligent collection of people I've spent time around. In my previous life, I was considered kind of odd. Not anymore. Well, at least not in a bad way. 

**Least favorite part of my job:** Some guy around the office started calling me Jenemy. You know, "Jenna" + "enemy". Now everybody is doing it. I'm starting to get a complex . . .

**Thing you've worked on that you're most proud of:** There are a lot of things I've worked on that I'm excited about, but they're in the process of being printed! So stay tuned....

![Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Eternal+Witness)**Other games you currently enjoy playing:** Mostly **Magic**. But I'm playing a lot of board games lately: RoboRally, Settlers of Catan, Hungry, Hungry Hippos. Sometimes we play **D&D** at lunch. **Favorite Magic card(s):** [Silhana Ledgewalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silhana+Ledgewalker), [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), and [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) are the first three that jumped into my head.

**In your spare time:** Running, judo, and writing.

**Something the readers don't know about you:** I really like movies about submarines. As detailed extensively elsewhere, I really like lemurs. Now someone needs to make a movie about lemurs on a submarine. And not just in cages or as some glorified mascot. That'd be boring. Paws on the periscope. Launching torpedoes. Awesome.
