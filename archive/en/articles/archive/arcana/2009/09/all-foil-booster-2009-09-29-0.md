Stories are told of boosters with all rares, or all foil premium cards. But those stories are strictly rumors. Legends. Tales told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

Until now.

Take one last trip to Alara and collect all 539 foil premium cards, in this handsome foil booster. Each of these boosters contains fifteen foil, black-bordered cards from *Shards of Alara, Conflux,* and *Alara Reborn*.

These boosters will be available for a limited time, starting on January 8, 2010. And they're only $11.99!
