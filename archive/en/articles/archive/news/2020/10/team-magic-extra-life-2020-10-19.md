The *Magic* community is coming together for our annual *Magic* Extra Life live stream charity event benefiting Seattle Children's Hospital.


Wizards has been a proud partner of Extra Life since 2015. This year, we're continuing to raise the bar with a goal of $1,300,000 #ForTheKids. To reach our goal, we need your help!


Content creators who would like to help fundraise for the *Magic* Extra Life 2020 campaign have two options. The first is to join the [*Magic: The Gathering* Extra Life Team](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=51052) as an individual fundraiser. The second is to create your own sub-team of up to six content creators under the [Wizards of the Coast Extra Life Super Team](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&id=1533). All the funds you or your sub-team raises will count toward the 2020 goal no matter which team you're a part of!


From now until November 7, 2020, each team will also be competing for this year's exclusive *MTG Arena* premium card style for [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company).

The top eight teams that raise the most donations during this period will receive the following number of codes distributed evenly among all team members to give out to their community as they see fit.


1. 7,000
2. 4,000
3. 3,000
4. 2,000
5. 1,500
6. 1,000
7. 750
8. 500

Codes will be redeemable from November 8, 2020 until January 1, 2021.


The [*Magic* Extra Life](http://extralife.wizards.com/) live stream will begin at 6 p.m. PT on November 7. Join us on [twitch.tv/Magic](https://www.twitch.tv/Magic) for a night of *MTG Arena* stipulation drafts, a Q&A with Mark Rosewater, mini *MTG Arena* Ironroot Chef, and more!
