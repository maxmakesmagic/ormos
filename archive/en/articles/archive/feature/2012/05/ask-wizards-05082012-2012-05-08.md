**Q:** With the Pro Tour coming up, does the Wizards office become a ghost town?


Thomas L.


**A:** From **Trick Jarrett**, Editor in Chief for **DailyMTG.com**


Surprisingly, no! Wizards employs several hundred people here in Washington and only a fraction of them are going to the event. We send a handful of people to the Pro Tour, from the people in Organized Play who oversee and make the tourney run to myself and a handful of others who are there for coverage work and also some folks from R&D so they can see the cards used live on the big stage.


With the three-day web stream now, as we experienced with Pro Tour *Dark Ascension*, there is a definite hit to productivity as people gather to watch the stream.
