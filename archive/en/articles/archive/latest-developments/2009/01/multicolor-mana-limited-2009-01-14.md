Tom LaPille makes things. Some of the things he makes are card sets, like Dark Ascension and Born of the Gods. Sometimes he makes stories, too. Sometimes he makes unexpected things, like 16th-century Japanese clothing. He's probably making something right now. 





![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/ld/ld21_cardfan.jpg)Here in **Magic** Ramp;D, we often find ourselves trying to reconcile conflicting goals. For example, last week I talked about how game play and flavor considerations can find themselves at odds. Another example of this kind of situation is that **Magic** players love drafting, and they also love multicolor-themed blocks. We love both of those things too, but making a multicolor-heavy block fun to draft is tricky. Gold cards are exciting, fun, and often powerful. However, they are also much harder to play than monocolored cards, and that puts a strain on Limited mana bases. 

I haven't been a **Magic** developer for very long. However, I have been a very active tournament **Magic** player since *Invasion*, which conveniently was the first multicolor-themed set developed with Limited in mind. Come with me as I take a walk down memory lane and look at *Invasion* block and *Ravnica* block with a developer's eye, and we'll see how those sets compare to *Shards of Alara*.

Before we start, it's time for this week's poll!
