*Planar Chaos* rare. Congratulations to **Sikyanakotik** for being the first to officially guess last week's Card of the Day cycle! All of last week's cards, as Sikyanakotik put it, have "names that contain all but one vowel, including y and w, sequentially omitting the five universal ones. Kudos are also due to **Prismetrix** for a very close guess earlier in the week and to **WeirdCal5135**, who seems to have made the same guess as S independently, a mere twenty minutes later.
