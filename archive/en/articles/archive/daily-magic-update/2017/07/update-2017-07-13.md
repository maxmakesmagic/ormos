The July 13, 2017 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 13, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Draft Weekend](http://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/draft-weekend). Catch the fever! (It's a good thing I'm not in charge of our slogans.)


Today's Musts
=============


1. [Magic Math: *Hour of Devastation*](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/magic-math-hour-of-devastation) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

I'm a simple man, as the saying goes. I see a Frank Karsten math article, I share it.


Today's topics are [Reason // Believe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reason+%2F%2F+Believe), [Ramunap Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramunap+Hydra), drafting Defeats, and other wacky thoughts that get churned through Karsten's math brain. It even results in a few decklists, like today's deck of the day.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [The Draft Archetypes of *Hour of Devastation*: Allied Color Pairs](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-draft-archetypes-of-hour-of-devastation-allied-color-pairs/) | ChannelFireball | Neal Oliver

[Draft Weekend](http://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/draft-weekend) is coming up, and while we've had [a number](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/how-play-limited/drafting-synergies-hour-devastation-2017-07-11) [of articles](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/how-play-limited/hour-devastation-first-picks-2017-07-11) [on Daily](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/how-play-limited/drafting-hour-devastation-archetypes-2017-07-10) to help prepare you, every bit helps. And Neal Oliver is an especially helpful voice on Limited, covering what to look for when drafting an allied color pair.


1. [Grixis Control in Standard (Videos)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxg8UAfS2YJZKgRMpYsPwpkzlY3O4WbwN) | TCGPlayer | Brian Braun-Duin

You've got seven videos teed up here of new Standard featuring the one, the only, [Nicol Bolas, God-Pharaoh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+God-Pharaoh). You could turn down watching these, but Nicol Bolas would not be pleased.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLxg8UAfS2YJZKgRMpYsPwpkzlY3O4WbwN>


1. [Blue-Red Control and Mardu Walkers in Standard](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/kyleboggemes-07132017-ur-control-and-mardu-walkers-in-standard/) | Gathering Magic | Kyle Boggemes

You need lists, you know you do. Boggemes has got your back.


1. [Against the Odds: Solemnity (Modern)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-solemnity-modern?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

[Solemnity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemnity) looks a whole heck of a lot like an answer to energy and +1/+1 counter synergies, but it's much, much more than that, as Seth (probably better known as SaffronOlive) can now attest after some pretty impressive odds with the *Hour of Devastation* standout.


1. [*Hour of Devastation* Modern Set Review](https://collected.company/2017/07/12/hou-modernsetreview/) | Masters of Modern | Ben Bateman and Alex Kessler

Maybe [Solemnity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemnity)? But that's certainly not all, as Bateman and Kessler break down all that *Hour of Devastation* has to offer in Modern.


1. [AFK — *Magic: The Gathering* – Commander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzLoE7Z5TQA) | LoadingReadyRun

I don't often include LRR's AFK stream videos in here, but I want to today for two reasons.


One, it's just really fun gameplay to keep on in the background. They have a great setup for streaming Commander games, the atmosphere is fun, and they crew is enjoyable to watch as always.


But also—did you know LRR streams (that would be the second reason) *Magic* on a fairly regular basis? True story! AFK, which is the streaming show this video is from, is not just about *Magic*, but does include it now and then. But today (Thursday) at about 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET/8 p.m. UTC will be their regular, Thursday *Magic* stream that goes for about 3 hours. You can view [their entire streaming schedule here](http://loadingreadyrun.com/live).

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Best explanation I've seen for why R&D reversed the 18-month rotation schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6n0qir/best_explanation_ive_seen_for_why_rd_reversed_the/)

In which Mark Rosewater talks a bit more about the decision process behind when we act on community feedback and when we don't. And it has nothing to do with the number of pizzas sent to R&D.


1. [*Hour of Devastation* Card Obsolescence Chart](http://imgur.com/qonjPyW)

I love these obsolescence charts. I never really think of the older cards that we're upgrading until someone points them out. [Aven Battle Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Battle+Priest)? [Angelic Blessing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Blessing)? [Seismic Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Strike)? [Duskdale Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskdale+Wurm)? I suppose there's a reason these cards deserved to be just a little bit better.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Blue-Red Gift](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/magic-math-hour-of-devastation/)

No, not [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven), though that would also greatly excite me. Instead, Frank Karsten has brewed up a [God-Pharaoh's Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Pharaoh%27s+Gift) list that his math says is pretty consistently able to get out a copy of the namesake artifact on turn four or five thanks to [Gate to the Afterlife](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gate+to+the+Afterlife). And if you're going to pay homage to Bolas, there's no better way than putting his gift on display early and often.
