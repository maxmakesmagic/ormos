*Magic Online* Turns 20!
------------------------


*Magic: The Gathering Online* wraps up its twentieth year on June 24! We want to celebrate this milestone with our players this June with the 20th Anniversary Series. Catch up on everything there is to know about upcoming events as well as the 20th Anniversary Series in [today's dedicated article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-turns-20-2022-06-07).

All-Access Returns June 8
-------------------------


Good news. All-Access Weeks are back! From June 8–25, the Mythic Event Token will be available in the *Magic Online* Store, allowing players to use almost every card on *Magic Online* during the 20th Anniversary Series.


![Mythic 20th Anniversary All-Access Event Token](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/20th%20Anniversary%20All-Access%20Event%20Token%20-%20Drop%20Shadow.png)


The Token is $25.00 USD, and the access will last until downtime on June 29. We'll remove all the Mythic Event Tokens from accounts and turn off All-Access during that downtime.


***Note****: Just like previous All-Access periods, certain cards (*Secret Lair *versions,* Battlebond*, and old-frame Power Nine) are unavailable. Also, cards with a **red border** in the Collection scene do not function and are not included. This includes* Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate *cards that are Backgrounds, or those that use the Choose a Background or taking the initiative mechanics, among others.*

-----------------------------------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend.


These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and, starting with this season, invitations to the 2023 World Championship!


First up this Saturday, June 11, we have the Modern Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC), and on Sunday, June 12, we have the Pioneer Showcase Challenge at 6 a.m. PT (13:00 UTC).


**NOTE**: The **Pauper Showcase Challenge** has been moved up a week to **Saturday, June 18** at 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC). This is to accommodate the 20th Anniversary Series Finals on June 25.


Then on Sunday, June 26, we finish things off with the Legacy Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (15:00).


Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. As with previous All-Access periods, players who have enabled All-Access are permited to compete in this round of Showcase Challenges. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in August.
