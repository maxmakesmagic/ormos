Sam Gomersall only needs one more point to make it into his first Grand Prix top eight unfortunately he has been paired down this round and so is, after a short consultation, forced to play the round.

Sam's deck is less than stellar a point which is proven by his first turn [Disciple of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault). This was matched by Daniel's [Auriok Transfixer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer) which along with a [Viridian Longbow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) killed off Sam's turn two play of an [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr). Sam has some good spells however and two [Consume Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit)s dealt with the Transfixer and a [Slith Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Ascendant) which threatened to become a huge threat. Sam continued to play [Disciple of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault)'s however a [Needlebug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needlebug) ambushed one during combat and a [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) gave Daniel some creatures to allow him to use the Longbow to full effect. Daniel's life total was dangerously low at this point and a [Bonesplitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter) put him on a very short clock. However an [Awe Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awe+Strike) bought him some time and the [Viridian Longbow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) allowed him to deal with all of Sam's Creatures forcing a concession from the Englishman.

The second game started off with another [Disciple of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) from Gomersall, well he is playing three of them...., this was matched however by a [Leonin Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Elder) from Bertelsen. [Neurok Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Familiar) and [Yotian Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier) joined Bertelsen's team putting a crimp on any plans that Sam had of stealing a quick win. Sam was able to play a [Lumengrid Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Augur) however allowing him good card selection if the game went on for a long time. Daniel however decided that letting the game go long was a bad idea taking an explosive turn right out of constructed playing two [AEther Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=AEther+Spellbomb)s and a [Myr Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) which now only cost 3 mana. Sam was able to [Consume Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit) the Enforcer but was having his life total nibbled away by a [Neurok Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Familiar) and a [Needlebug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needlebug) that he could not block. Daniel summoned a [Taj-Nar Swordsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taj-Nar+Swordsmith) and searched up a [Viridian Longbow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) and it seemed like the game was slipping away from Sam though thankfully Daniel could only move the longbow once each turn as he was stuck on 5 land. Needless to say Daniel drew a land off the top and set about decimating the Englishman's defenses. Though Sam battled valiantly an [Icy Manipulator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Manipulator) from Daniel meant it was only a matter of time before the Englishman was forced to offer the hand. He can only hope he can pick up the draw he needs in the next round.
