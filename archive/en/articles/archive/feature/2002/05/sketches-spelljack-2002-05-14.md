This week's Sketches looks at the *Judgment* card [Spelljack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spelljack). [Spelljack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spelljack) was illustrated by Pete Venters, who has been doing **Magic** cards since *Antiquities*.


### 1. Art Description


These are the instructions given to the artist:


"This is a blue card and should show a blue wizard catching a green spell out of the air. It trails down into his open spellbook creating some sort of diagram in the book." The card was originally called "Super Desertion," playing off the *Visions* card [Desertion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desertion).


### 2. Sketch


This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Pete.


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of his final piece. He chose no to include leaves as part of the green spell.


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as you all know it today. The image was flipped horizontally by the art director for aesthetic reasons.
