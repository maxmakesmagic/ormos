 With a Grand Prix title to his name and a win at last year's World *Magic* Cup, Timothée Simonot is a well established name on both the French and the European *Magic* scene. Let's put ourselves in his shoes for a second. We've finished Day One undefeated. We probably need a 3-2-1 record on Day Two to make Top 8. What goodies are we hoping to open in *Journey into Nyx*? How can we take full advantage of your knowledge of a format we have been playing non-stop over the course of the last eight months? I took a look at every pick Timothée Simonot did in the draft. Let's find out what his options were, and how far they will take him at the Grand Prix.




 The, oh so precious, pack one greeted the Frenchman with some interesting options. The rare was [Launch the Fleet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Launch+the+Fleet), maybe not an ideal first pick even if you do end up with a White heroic-based deck. The other noteworthy cards were [Sightless Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sightless+Brawler), [Nyx Infusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyx+Infusion), [Ravenous Leucrocota](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Leucrocota) and a Dacra Mystic. Simonot took his time before settling for Dacra Mystic.
