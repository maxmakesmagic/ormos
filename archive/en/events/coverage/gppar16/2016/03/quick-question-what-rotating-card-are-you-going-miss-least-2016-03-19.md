With shadows looming over Innistrad and the release of *Shadows over Innistrad* looming on the horizon, we asked pro players at Grand Prix Paris what card or cards they would miss playing with in Standard.

**Gold-level pro Christian Calcano:** [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). It was too good. Every time I didn't play Rhino, I'd lose to it and wonder why I didn't play it myself.

**No. 16 Joel Larsson:** Fetch lands. Not only because they make the games go longer, but also because they opened up too many possibilities for deck building. I'm also not going to miss the go-to multicolor cards, like [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider), and [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom). Deck building is more interesting when you don't have as many versatile and powerful cards.

***Magic Online* Champion Magnus Lantto:** The fetch lands, again. It will be nice not having to shuffle every turn.

**Hall of Famer Ben Stark:** I'm pretty happy to see [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) go because they are too powerful for Standard. How many decks have there been in the Abzan colors that didn't play [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)? Also, I like that the rotation of fetch lands means less shuffling; now more matches will have an opportunity to finish in time.

**Hall of Famer Gabriel Nassif:** The fetch lands because they led to too much shuffling with 50-minute rounds. I'm looking forward to see a new mana base format.

**Two-time Pro Tour semifinalist Patrick Dickmann:** [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors). The deck was just too dominant and didn't make for enjoyable games either, though opinions obviously vary on this point. I never liked playing against the deck, or with it. I'm also not sad to see the four-color mana bases go, and the decks they enabled which were basically just collections of all the best cards.

**Gold-level pro Oliver Polak-Rottmann:** [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) was a pain. Also, while I liked fetch lands with regards to deck construction, them leaving Standard is probably for the best, both because of all of this time taken up by endless shuffling and also to reign in the four-color madness.

**No. 18 Martin Dang:** [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), I guess. I don't think I'll miss anything in particular as much as I'm just generally looking forward to the format being shaken up. It really is time, and *Shadows over Innistrad* is looking great.
