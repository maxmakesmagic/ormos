These four playtest cards did not eventually become four real cards, but instead they became a whole mechanic.

If you read Mark's [article from last week,](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mr37) you'll remember that he needed to convince other members of R&D that morph was a mechanic worth exploring.

Well, these are some of the basic mock-ups he made to do just that, by actually playing with some of the cards.

You can see that it was called "stealth" in its first incarnation, and the "3" hints that there might have been plans to have creatures playable face-down for different costs (although it is now known that uniformity is the key to the mechanic's design). Also, you could reveal a creature without paying its cost with the option of sacrificing it.

(The 1997 copyright date on the cards is a little offâ€¦ Mark should fix his computer's calendar.)
