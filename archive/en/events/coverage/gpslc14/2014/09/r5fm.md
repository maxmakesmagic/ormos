 It's become accepted knowledge that it's better to play in the *Magic 2015* Sealed format than draw. This is unusual for Sealed, which is generally slower and preferences incremental card advantage. This match was a perfect example of why. No. 13 (and soon to be inducted Hall of Fame member) Paul Rietzl and Grand Prix-winning, Pod-deck-slinging Sam Pardee slammed up against one another in a blink-and-you'd-miss-it match.



Before the games, the two grumbled about their respective decks as they shuffled the cards up.



 "Honestly, it's not the greatest deck in the history of *Magic*," Rietzl mused.



Pardee, who nodded along posed the question, "If you could mulligan your pool and had to discard two random rares from a new pool would you take it?"


"Definitely." Paul said without missing a beat.


"What about a five-pack sealed pool?" Instead of taking out the rare, Pardee was suggesting to lose an entire pack.


Rietzl had to think about this one. "Nah. But I would take only three rares, actually less."


"Deal."


They both presented the shuffled decks to each other, did appropriate cuts, and drew for the match.



**Game One**



After this game, it looked like one of them had been lying. 



 Rietzl opened with the [Borderland Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Marauder), attacked for three, then followed up with [Oreskos Swiftclaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oreskos+Swiftclaw). After two [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike)s on Pardee's first and second spells—[Goblin Roughrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Roughrider) and [Aeronaut Tinkerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeronaut+Tinkerer)—Rietzl was in striking distance and Pardee was boardless. Pardee was taken aback.



"Man, my deck's not that bad! What is this?" Pardee said, exasperated. "I'm at five?! Well, let's see what I draw . . . ." he said, knowing there wasn't actually anything for him to draw.


After the empty draw step, Pardee shrugged his shoulders and scooped the cards up.



**Paul Rietzl 1 – 0 Sam Pardee**



Rietzl consoled Pardee while readying for the second game. "Hey, think about it this way: If we hadn't gone to the feature-match area, I would've drawn a completely different hand. Think about that." Paul gave Sam a little knowing nod and partial wink.


"You know, you're absolutely right. Thanks." Pardee laughed and readied himself after that stumble, hoping he could hold on in the next game.



**Game Two**



"I'll keep." It seemed like Pardee's hand wasn't the best, but it could've been show.



 Rietzl's [Oreskos Swiftclaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oreskos+Swiftclaw) sailed past a [Goblin Roughrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Roughrider) for the game's first attack and Rietzl followed up with a [Geist of the Moors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+the+Moors). The ridin'-dirty goblin found an [Inferno Fist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Fist) and swung back for Pardee on the following turn.



"So wait, if I block, I lose both my guys, and if I don't block, I take a bunch of damage and still lose my flyer. Is that about it?"



 "That sounds like an accurate assessment to me." Pardee was happy; he thought he might actually be in for a real game. Rietzl chose to block with his [Geist of the Moors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+the+Moors) and the board was reset. Pardee sacrificed the [Inferno Fist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Fist) to kill the Swiftclaw and the two creatures in combat traded shortly after.



Back to square one, the game had started afresh. Perhaps this would be a much closer game than the last one.



 Jk, lols. Rietzl rebuilt with an unpowered [Scrapyard Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapyard+Mongrel), another Swiftclaw and an end-of-Sam's-turn [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm). All Pardee had was an [Aeronaut Tinkerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeronaut+Tinkerer), sadly on the ground, and three untapped mana. He sighed.



On his next attack step, Rietzl assessed his options, again out loud, talking about the "infinite theoretical damage" Pardee would take if he had nothing in his hand. After a few seconds of thought, all four creatures swung in.


It was shown that Pardee did have nothing and went all the way down to five. He took the prophesied "infinite theoretical damage" from the Hall-of-Famer elect, though it actually was more like eight or so damage. After drawing for this turn and looking at the board, Sam saw that the same thing was just going to happen again next turn.


He extended his hand, and about ten minutes into the round, both players were headed for the showers.





*The match was so quick, here's No. 13 Paul Rietzl walking on airs after his win...*
