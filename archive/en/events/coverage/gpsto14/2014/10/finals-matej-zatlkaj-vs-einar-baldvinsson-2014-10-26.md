This was it. Of the original 1,043 players only two remained to fight for the honor, the glory, the trophy, and the title of Grand Prix Stockholm champion. In one corner, there was Slovak Matej Zatlkaj, veteran of multiple Pro Tour Top 8s, in the other was little-known Einar Baldvinsson from Iceland. Actually, one should say "previously little-known" because by now Baldvinsson had clearly made a name for himself.


As for the decks which would be used here: Zatlkaj had dusted off an old favorite. Well, old-ish, seeing as Jeskai had only really been established two weeks ago at the Pro Tour, but with so much going on in the world of Standard right now, two weeks ago might as well be ancient times, right? Meanwhile, Baldvinsson was running the brand-new Temur Aggro that was first seen in the hands of Brian Kibler one week ago at Grand Prix Los Angeles.

Game 1
======



The game began with several trades. The first creatures to actually survive were [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) on Baldvinsson's side and [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix) on Zatlkaj's. Over the next couple of turns, Baldvinsson added Heir to the Wilds and [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) to his team, but at that point [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix) had already taken him down to 7, and the game ended in a flurry of burn spells.


**Matej Zatlkaj 1-0 Einar Baldvinsson**


Game 2
======


Baldvinsson led with [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr), while Zatlkaj had [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos). Around them other creatures died but those two stuck around. Later, they were joined by [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) and [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider), respectively.

Polukranos turned monstrous and ate a token, but while the Temur deck's creatures were certainly bigger, the Jeskai Way was faster, lightning-quick, so to say. Zatlkaj's [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) and [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) ended the game when Polukranos had barely gotten in one attack.



**Matej Zatlkaj 2-0 Einar Baldvinsson**


**Congratulations to Matej Zatlkaj, champion of Grand Prix Stockholm 2014!**
