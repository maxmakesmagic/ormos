We've shown instances where two different cards got their art from the same illustration ([Gallantry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gallantry)/[Repentant Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repentant+Vampire), [Stronghold Biologist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stronghold+Biologist)/[Stronghold Machinist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stronghold+Machinist)), but there are also instances where one card used the same picture… twice!

Years ago, commons were often printed with more than one picture (*Fallen Empires* and *Alliances* were the frontrunners in this practice). Sometimes the pictures were all done by different artists (like the four [Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid) cards in *Fallen Empires*), sometimes by the same artist (Terese Nielsen drew both *Alliances'* [Elvish Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Ranger)s), and sometimes they were taken from the same painting.

The two versions of [Soldevi Adnate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldevi+Adnate) from *Alliances* were taken from one large illustration by Chris Rush. The full image is below.
