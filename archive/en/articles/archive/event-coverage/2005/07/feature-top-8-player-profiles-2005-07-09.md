 Oiso*


Masashi Oiso


Masashi Oiso drew three times to land on top of the
 standings with 36 points and an11-1-3 record. It is the fifth
 Top 8 of Oiso’s young Pro Tour career. Despite skipping
 Philadelphia to attend school, Oiso – the only Hall of
 Fame-eligible player in the 2012 crop – finds himself back in
 the hunt for the Player of the Year title. If he wins Pro
 Tour-London, he would take a narrow lead over frontrunner
 Olivier Ruel.


**Age:** 21  
**Hometown:** Higashi-Hiroshima, Japan

**What was your record on Day 1:** 6-1 **Day 2:**
 5-0-3  
**What colors or color combination did you try to
 avoid?**  

 Red-green-blue is good, black-white is not good.  
  
**What did the addition of Saviors of Kamigawa do to your
 draft style?**  

 I don't want to draft white and black after *Saviors*.
 White-black was my favorite color before *Saviors*.  
**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare
 with?**  

 Magic Online, three days  
**What do you think of your chances in the Top 8?**  

 A little

 Siron*


Geoffrey Siron


This is the second Pro Tour Top 8
 of Geoffrey Siron’s career, following up his place in the Class
 of Columbus at the start of the season. Before that he had
 finished as high as 9th all the way back at Pro Tour-Osaka –
 his first Pro Tour, by the way – with no other notable Pro Tour
 finishes in between. He did garner some attention at last
 year’s Worlds when the Belgian National team reached the
 elimination rounds.


**Age:** 21  
**Hometown:** Belgium  
**Occupation:** Student  
**Number of Times Playing on the Pro Tour:** 14  
**How did you qualify for PT London?** Pro Points  
**Number of GP/PT T8s:** This is my second PT Top
 8


**Other Previous Magic accomplishments:** Team Worlds
 finalist in San Francisco, Top 8 at PT Columbus earlier this
 season, and two Top 16s.


**What was your record on Day 1:** 7-0 **Day 2:**
 4-1-3  
**Did you have a consistent draft strategy, and what was
 it?**  

 Not really, I just think that green is good.  
**What colors or color combinations did you try to
 avoid?**  

 White/black, white/red, and white/green.  
**What did the addition of Saviors of Kamigawa do to your
 draft style?**  

 "Green became good."  
**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare
 with?**  
**Magic Online**, both beta and regular, plus two real life
 drafts per week. I played more or less 100 drafts on **Magic
 Online**.  
**What do you think of your chances in the Top 8?**  

 1 in 8!

 Walamies*


Tomi Walamies


Joining Oiso and Siron at the 36-point plateau was a
 familiar face returning to the Pro Tour after an 18-month
 absence. Tomi Walamies was forced to play his final round (he
 earned his 36 points the hard way), and he decked his opponent
 one game and applied the beatdown the next. All of his studying
 over the shoulder of Sam Gomersall evidently paid off big
 time.


**Age:** 24  
**Hometown:** Helsinki, Finland  
**Occupation:** Stand-up comedian  
**Number of Times Playing on the Pro Tour:** Infinity (I
 learn slow)  
**How did you qualify for PT London?** Qualifier in London
 two months ago  
**Number of GP/PT T8s:** 0 Grand Prix, 2 Pro Tours  
**Other Previous Magic accomplishments:** Third at Euros
 2001, second Worlds team competition 2003, Finland National
 Champion 2001, 2002, 2003  
**What was your record on Day 1:** 5-2 **Day 2:** 7-1  
**Did you have a consistent draft strategy, and what was
 it?**  

 In all my drafts, I fought with neighbors and/or switched
 colors. Hardly the most consistent strategy.  
**What colors or color combination did you try to
 avoid?**  

 In **Magic Online** 8-4 drafts, white was overdrafted. It
 has no first-pick commons in Saviors so I tried to avoid
 it.  
  
**What did the addition of Saviors of Kamigawa do to your
 draft style?**  

 With *Champions-Champions-Betrayers,* I tried to avoid
 red, only taking it when I open Glacial Ray or rares. Now I
 favored Flame over Moth.  
**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare
 with?**  

 Twenty drafts of C-C-B before the PTQ and about a dozen with
 C-B-S before the PT. In C-C-C format I was truly awful so I
 wanted to get in beteer shape.  
**What do you think of your chances in the Top 8?**  

 I would be the heavy favorite if only it wasn't for Antti.  
**In light of the tragic events in London on Thursday, is
 there a message you'd like to share with your friends and
 family back home?**  

 I am fine. I will not be using public transportation.

 Zidek*


Arnost Zidek


Arnost Zidek was the last
 undefeated player standing at the end of the 10th round before
 his legs got a little wobbly. He lost Rounds 11 and 12 before
 regaining his footing against Tomohiro Kaji in the 13th round.
 Zidek emerged from the massive scrum of Grand Prix-Paris to
 finish in the Top 8 and earn his way here. He also quietly took
 home a check in Nagoya, giving him three strong finishes in the
 *Kamigawa* Limited arena.


**Age:** 28  
**Hometown:** Ostrava, Czech Republic  
**Occupation:** Mathematics University Teacher  
**Number of Times Playing on the Pro Tour:** This is my
 third.  
**How did you qualify for PT London?** DCI Rankings
   
**Number of GP/PT T8s:** GP Paris 2004


**Other Previous Magic
 accomplishments:**  

 Czech National Team at Worlds 2002 (Sydney)  

 GP Paris Top 8  

 44th Place PT Nagoya


**What was your record on Day
 1:** 7-0 **Day 2: 4-2 and two I.D.'s**  
**Did you have a consistent draft strategy, and what was
 it?**  

 I tried to recognize which color is under-drafted and jump into
 that color as soon as possible. :-)  

 I prefer playing blue/anything, or red/black if I can't get a
 blue deck.  
**What colors or color combinations did you try to
 avoid?**  

 White/Green  
**What did the addition of Saviors of Kamigawa do to your
 draft style?**  

 The set is a little bit slower than triple Champions, so now I
 try to pick aggressive cards early.  
**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare
 with?**  

 Drafting on Magic Online beta around 5 times per day.  
**What do you think of your chances in the Top 8?**  

 It depends on how the draft goes.






![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptlon05/t8_larsson.jpg)*David
 Larsson*


David Larsson


David Larsson was playing in his
 first Pro Tour after earning his way here via a Pro Tour
 Qualifier in Sweden. He is an experienced online drafter, and
 after starting off 0-2 he lived the dream of all players
 teetering on the brink of elimination by reeling off an 11-0-2
 streak to earn his Sunday spot.


**Age:** 21  
**Hometown:** Lund, Sweden  
**Occupation:** Student (History)  
**Number of Times Playing on the Pro Tour:** This is my
 first  
**How did you qualify for PT London?** Winning a PTQ
   
**Number of GP/PT T8s:** This is my first


**Other Previous Magic
 accomplishments:** Been in the Hall of Champions on **Magic
 Online** for quite a while.


**What was your record on Day
 1:** 5-2 **Day 2:** 6-0-2  
**Did you have a consistent draft strategy, and what was
 it?**  

 I try to avoid black. If I get green signals in
 *Champions* I happily jump into it.  
**What colors or color combination did you try to
 avoid?**  

 Black and blue-red  
  
**What did the addition of Saviors of Kamigawa do to your
 draft style?**  

 I re-evaluated green and stopped forcing white. I also began
 questioning black.  
**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare
 with?**  

 I practiced a weekend with my teammates (Team Habo) but I
 didn't have access to beta testing so I hadn't tested much the
 last weeks. I've played the whole block a lot on **Magic
 Online**.  
**What do you think of your chances in the Top 8?**  

 I'm obviously the underdog but I think I can surprise a lot of
 you.  
**In light of the tragic events in London on Thursday, is
 there a message you'd like to share with your friends and
 family back home?**  

 Well, I've talked with them a lot and I was asked to ditch the
 PT several times. When I started 0-2 I called my parents and
 asked for help with a plane ticket. I love you all and I'll see
 you on Monday.

 Fujita*


Tsuyoshi Fujita


Resident Genius Tsuyoshi Fujita was the first Japanese
 player ever to stride across the Sunday stage way back during
 Pro Tour-Tokyo. Since then he has posted countless Grand Prix
 Top 8s and designed some of the most influential Constructed
 decks over the past few years, but a PT Sunday appearance
 eluded him. Not only is this his first return to Sunday action,
 but Saturday was only the second time he has reached Day Two of
 a Limited event.


**Age:** 21?  
**Hometown:** Osaka, Japan  
**Occupation:** Pro **Magic** Player  
**Number of Times Playing on the Pro Tour:** I don't
 know  
**How did you qualify for PT London?** Pro Player Club
   
**Number of GP/PT T8s:** 1 Pro Tour Top 8, 2 Grand Prix
 wins


**Other Previous Magic
 accomplishments:** 2004 National Champion


**What was your record on Day
 1:** 6-1 **Day 2:** 5-2-1


**Did you have a consistent draft
 strategy, and what was it?**  

 Blue or white flying beatdown.  
**What colors or color combination did you try to
 avoid?**  

 Red-blue, blue-white, red-black, black-green  
  
**What did the addition of Saviors of Kamigawa do to your
 draft style?**  

 I don't like black.  
**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare
 with?**  

 A little Magic Online and draft with friends Osamu Fujita,
 Masahiko Morita.  
**What do you think of your chances in the Top 8?**  

 Nothing. Because this is my second time making Day Two of a
 Limited Pro Tour and first time was Mercadian Masques.

 Sadeghpour*


Johan Sadeghpour


Anton Jonsson missed his usual
 Limited Pro Tour Day Three appointment this time around, but
 his countryman and playtest partner Johan Sadeghpour picked up
 his slack. Johan was one of four Scandinavian players to
 advance on Sunday – two from his homeland Sweden and two from
 Finland – while there were zero North American, French, or
 Dutch players in the Top 8. Despite being a seasoned Pro Tour
 veteran this was his first Top 8 (other than a Masters in New
 Orleans).


**Age:** 25  
**Hometown:** Umea, Sweden  
**Occupation:** Expert Consultant  
**Number of Times Playing on the Pro Tour:** No idea.  
**How did you qualify for PT London?** Pro Tour Qualifier
   
**Number of GP/PT T8s:** Zerooooo


**Other Previous Magic
 accomplishments:**  

 Top 8 Masters at New Orleans, that ain't for nuffin.  
**What was your record on Day 1:** 6-1 **Day 2:
 5-2-1**  
**Did you have a consistent draft strategy, and what was
 it?**  

 I just tried to see what colors were open and take them.  
**What colors or color combinations did you try to
 avoid?**  

 I tried to avoid red/black and red/white, they never seem to
 win.  
**What did the addition of Saviors of Kamigawa do to your
 draft style?**  

 Made me start drafting green.  
**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare
 with?**  

 I did all my testing on Magic Online since nobody really plays
 in Umea besides me and Anon Jonnson.  
**What do you think of your chances in the Top 8?**  

 Probably winning, unless I have to play Oiso, he's too good
 :(

 Malin*


Antti Malin


Rounding out the Top 8 was Finland’s Antti Malin, who was
 playing in his fifth Pro Tour. A 23rd-place finish in
 Philadelphia earned him an invite to this weekend’s
 festivities. He also posted an 18th-place finish in Columbus to
 kick off the season, quietly piling up an impressive resume
 that he hopes to improve upon Sunday.


**Age:** 22  
**Hometown:** Helsinki, Finland  
**Occupation:** Student  
**Number of Times Playing on the Pro Tour:** 5  
**How did you qualify for PT London?** Top 32
 Philadelphia  
**Number of GP/PT T8s:** Just this one.


**Other Previous Magic
 accomplishments:** 2 Top 24s this season now.


**What was your record on Day
 1:** 5-2 **Day 2:** 6-1-1  
  
**What did the addition of Saviors of Kamigawa do to your
 draft style?**  

 I'm now going second quite often, and picking Moonfolk a bit
 higher.  
**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare
 with?**  

 I drafted on **Magic Online** and also at a Helsinki Magic
 Shop called Safe Haven. I also got some drafting in at GP
 Bologna and here on Thursday.  
**What do you think of your chances in the Top 8?**  

 Quite even, depending on how the draft goes.
