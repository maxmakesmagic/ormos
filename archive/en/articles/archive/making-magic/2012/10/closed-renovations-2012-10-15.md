After four years of writing From the Lab, [Noel deCordova](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Noel%20deCordova) has shuttered his laboratory of Johnny-fueled experiments. His writing has been a regular feature for the site and his contributions will be missed. He followed in the steps of [Chris Millar](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Chris%20Millar) and [Mark Gottlieb](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Mark%20Gottlieb) carrying on the joy of fun and crazy deckbuilding.


### Time for a Tune Up!


From the Lab, as a result, will be taking a break for a while. As [we did with Savor the Flavor](/en/articles/archive/editors-notes%E2%80%94changing-lineup-2012-03-26) before bringing it back as Uncharted Realms, we're going to be putting From the Lab on hiatus for a few months. We're going to reexamine what the column did, how it performed, and re-examine what it is that we want the column to do as well as examining what it is you, the readers, want it to do. Taking all of that into account, we will decide how to better bring those things together.


### Meanwhile...


In the meantime, we are going to run a column that focuses on building and playing Sealed deck. It will kick off in the next few weeks. This stems from an idea I had a few weeks ago and based on community feedback it seemed quite popular. This column will run most likely through the end of the year.


You can always email me your feedback by using the link below, or reach out to me [via Twitter!](https://twitter.com/TrickMTG) I look forward to reading your feedback and will do my best to respond to as many of you as I am able.
