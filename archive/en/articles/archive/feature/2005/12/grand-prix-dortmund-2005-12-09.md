Grand Prix are easily the biggest open events the DCI offers. They're high-energy and held around the world. Plus, no invitation is necessary -- anyone can attend.

Even if you don’t want to attend the main event, there are still plenty of reasons to come. A Grand Prix is not just a regular **Magic**  tournament… Grand Prix’s in Europe are true **Magic**  events. Besides the main tournaments, there’s plenty of excitement throughout the weekend that you can enjoy… There are loads of side events, **Magic**  artists on site to sign your **Magic**  cards, and lots more…

So you have plenty of reasons to come to one of the many GP stops in Europe.

[Second stop in 2006 is **GP Dortmund** on **February 18-19th**](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=grandprix/dortmund06/facts)

You can’t make it to Dortmund? Don’t worry; we’ve got 6 more Grand Prix lined up in 2006. More information will become available soon. Just keep an eye on the [2006 GP schedule](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=grandprix/schedule). 

CU there!
