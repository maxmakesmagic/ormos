### The Magic Game Show


With Richard Hagon


Would you like to win 1000 Magic rares?


Join us in the feature match area on Friday & Saturday at 8PM.  
 Contestants will be chosen at random from those present to play in the game show each night.


Contestants will be asked Magic trivia questions. 15 questions will be asked with ever-increasing difficulty. Once a contestant answers 5 or 10 correct questions, he or she is "safe" at that level and will win either 1 or 32 rare Magic cards.


A contestant may quit at any time. When a contestant quits, he or she wins the number of rare "Magic" cards indicated on the chart below by the number of correct questions answered. 


If a contestant misses a question, the he or she is eliminated and receives a number of rare Magic cards (0, 1, or 32) according to the "level" he or she has achieved.


Answer all 15 questions correctly and win 1000 Magic rares!!!
