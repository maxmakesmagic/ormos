It was a mirror of first-timers in the semifinals, as both Scott Kirkwood and Brent Clawson were playing in their first Grand Prix Top 8. And both were on streaks: Kirkwood had defeated four straight Abzan opponents while Clawson was on a hot streak after squeaking into Day 2 at 7-2 and punching his ticket to the Top 8 by just not losing on Sunday.


“I've played against five Abzan decks in a row, and won the four before this,” Kirkwood informed Clawson as they chatted before the match.”


“Well, hopefully this one will be the one that beats you,” Clawson said with a laugh.


“However it happens, I just hope it will be a good game,” Kirkwood replied. “I'm stoked to be here.”


**The Decks**


There was little mystery to Clawson's deck; he said he was playing Abzan because it won the Pro Tour. The mix of removal spells, versatile effects like [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) and the ever-omniscient [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), the deck has been a mainstay of Standard for more than a year, and the formula proved successful enough to send Clawson to the elimination rounds.


Kirkwood sat down with Red-Green Landfall, a deck identical in colors to the more popular Atarka Red but different in function. While both decks like to attack and feature the dreaded end-game combo of [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) plus [Temur Battle Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Battle+Rage), the landfall deck utilizes [Scythe Leopard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scythe+Leopard) and [Snapping Gnarlid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Gnarlid) to make its aggressive starts even more aggressive alongside a few fetch lands.


**The Games**


That aggressive potential was on full display in the first game, as Kirkwood curved [Scythe Leopard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scythe+Leopard) into [Snapping Gnarlid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Gnarlid) into a morphed [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) as Clawson struggled with a mulligan that left him with three [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) in hand. When a Dashed [Zurgo Bellstriker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zurgo+Bellstriker) joined the party along with a fetch, Clawson suddenly found himself down to one life before his fourth turn.


He had found a card that could help in [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). Unfortunately, that would mean cracking a [Flooded Strand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand) to do so, and at just one life that wasn't a possibility. With that, the pair were on to the second game.

In the second game it was Clawson who got to be aggressive, turning his [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree) into a 3/3 and drawing first blood by attacking past a [Scythe Leopard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scythe+Leopard). That plan changed quickly when [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) plus the Leopard rumbled back for 4 damage. With that, both players began to build up their board, with Anafenza and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) for Clawson and a pair of landfall creatures for Kirkwood, who was holding an ominous grip of three cards.


Wary to avoid the “combo kill,” Clawson kept his team back before casting [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) to check the way. When Kirkwood revealed naught but three lands, it was time for Anafenza and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) to turn sideways. The beastly pair did their work quickly, and a second [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) sealed the deal.


Kirkwood debated long and hard over whether or not to keep his six-card hand in the decider. Finally, he decided to keep, and bottomed the top card of his deck before playing a Mountain and passing.

The reason for his consternation quickly became clear, as he missed a second land drop and was forced to pass back without a play. While Clawson got on board first with a [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker), he was also forced to pass after failing to field a third land.


When Kirkwood did manage to find lands, a pair of [Silkwrap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silkwrap) took out the two small creatures he managed to cast, with the [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) growing all the while. As the Construct began to chip away at Kirkwood's life total, he was reduced to using his [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command) simply to burn Clawson's safely-high life total. Two attack steps later and still no creature, Kirkwood revealed his hand, showing that he did have the [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense)/[Temur Battle Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Battle+Rage) combo. But without a creature to use it on, he instead extended his hand and wished Clawson good luck in the finals.
