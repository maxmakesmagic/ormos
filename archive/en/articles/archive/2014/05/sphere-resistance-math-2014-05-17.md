 Remember this gem?

If you haven't been playing since the dawn of forever, you might not have ever encountered it, but its lineage lives on in some more contemporary examples.





[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grand+Arbiter+Augustin+IV)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Arbiter+Augustin+IV)

Every one of these cards is framed as a way to punish greedy opponents for not playing or having enough mana to operate normally. A tax of one mana is seemingly small, but often incredibly significant. Just compare these two cards.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Isamaru%2C+Hound+of+Konda)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isamaru%2C+Hound+of+Konda)




[Glory Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) is somewhat Limited playable, but never has seen an ounce of Constructed play. [Isamaru, Hound of Konda](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isamaru%2C+Hound+of+Konda), on the other hand, was an all-star in its prime and would likely see play in Standard and Block Constructed if printed in some form today. And the only difference is a single mana.




 So why, then, are players voluntarily starting with a [Sphere of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Resistance) in play in *Theros* Block Constructed?



Let me explain. While discussing the format on Day One with Hall of Famer Patrick Chapin, he dropped this gem that seemed to sum up the tension in this format.



 "All of the three color decks are basically starting with [Sphere of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Resistance) in play because they have to play all of the scry lands," Chapin said of the two-color comes-into-play-tapped lands that define the fixing in this block.




 So, we've established that [Sphere of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Resistance) is bad. We've also established that playing three colors pretty much means getting stuck with a virtual [Sphere of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Resistance) in play. It's like a math problem.




[Sphere of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Resistance) = Bad




 Three-color mana base = [Sphere of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Resistance)



Therefore:


Three-color mana base = Bad?



 Given the popularity of three color decks this weekend – including Red-Green Elspeth, the most played deck – the conclusion in our little logic problem is clearly incorrect. If we take Chapin's comment as a given, that somehow means that, in this format, [Sphere of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Resistance) isn't actually all that bad.




 "Card qualities for aggressive decks are just lower and are more or less just worse," said Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas. "The aggressive decks are really just missing [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)."



As it turns out, aggressive strategies are a little short on power as a result of sticking to one or two colors. Since they're a little less powerful, they're also a step slower and prone to flooding here and there.





*While Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas believes that the two-color decks just don't have the card quality to match up against the more expensive cards in this format, he is well aware that they can steal games due to the slower three-color deck's slow mana bases.*
