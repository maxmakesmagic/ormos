After a flurry of changes following [Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk) and the subsequent Grand Prix, we have a week of relative calm on the *Magic* Top 25, with nary a player budging from his hard-fought spots in the rankings. No. 1 Owen Turtenwald maintains his stranglehold on the top spot after a solid finish in [Grand Prix Los Angeles](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpla14) followed by a week off while players across the pond took on [Grand Prix Stockholm](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsto14).


Speaking of that hotly contested European Grand Prix, a number of stalwarts performed admirably and may be looking to crash the Top 25 with strong performances as the season moves along. Champion Matej Zatlkaj is a Gold-level pro with multiple Pro Tour Top 8 finishes on his resume and, now, a trophy on his mantel. Joining him in an accomplished Top 8 were Christian Seibold of [Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptbng14) Top 8 fame and Lukas Blohon, another former Pro Tour Top 8 competitor. They all have the chops to crash the rankings and now have a result to help push them to new heights.


And they'll have plenty of opportunities coming up, as Grand Prix Nashville and Santiago this weekend are followed by Madrid and New Jersey in two weeks. Grand Prix New Jersey is shaping up to be a truly phenomenal event, so don't be surprised if much of the Top 25 is in attendance with just weeks to spare before the World Championships in Nice, France, truly shake up the rankings from head to toe.
