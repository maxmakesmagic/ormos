Eight players sat down in the feature match area for this first of the three elimination rounds. We have four matches to cover, so let's get right to it!


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsto14/qf1.jpg)*L-R: Alexander Pasgaard (Jeskai) vs. Thiago Rodrigues (Abzan)*




In the first game, Rodrigues led with [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor). Pasgaard fought back with two copies of [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) and one [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider), and [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm)—granting lifelink and +1/+1 to his team—made the game interesting despite Rodrigues's [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). However, in the end [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), as it is wont to do, won the race.



After intial trades in the second game Rodrigues managed to stick [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and once again [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor). Meanwhile, Pasgaard tried to take the role of control player here, a somewhat ambitious plan that backfired spectacularly, especially when he failed to find a fifth land and was stuck with uncastable [Keranos, God of Storms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keranos%2C+God+of+Storms), [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities), and [Prognostic Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx).


**Alexander Pasgaard 0-2 Thiago Rodrigues**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsto14/qf2.jpg)*L-R: Giovanni Rosi (Mono-Red) vs. Einar Baldvinsson (Temur)*




A lot of little red creatures easily overwhelmed Baldvinsson in the first game. But then, playing first and leading with [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), Baldvinsson was able to win the second. In the third, Rosi lost all of his early drops to [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning), and [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws). He then lost most of his life to [Savage Knuckleblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Knuckleblade) but managed a remarkable comeback, eventually deploying enough creatures to keep [Savage Knuckleblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Knuckleblade) on defense. Just in time, before Rosi's growing army of creatures would take the game, Baldvinsson ripped lethal [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws).



**Giovanni Rosi 1-2 Einar Baldvinsson**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsto14/qf3.jpg)*L-R: Matteo Cirigliano (G/B Enchantress) vs. Matej Zatlkaj (Jeskai)*




[Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) and [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix) quickly took Cirigliano into the single digits. Thanks to what appeared to be a timely [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) it looked as if Cirigliano would be able to find his way back into the game, but it was too late after all: Another [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) and [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm) took game one for Zatlkaj.



In the second game, Zatlkaj's draw was very defensive, with lots of counters and removal. He couldn't stop everything, though, and eventually fell to a pair of [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant)s and [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos).


Zatlkaj's early [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) was matched by Cirigliano with a turn-two [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). Zatlkaj pointed [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning) at [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), at Cirigliano, and at his Courser, attacking with his 3/3 [Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker). Cirigliano failed to find a land, settling for [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) instead. Zatlkaj suspended [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) with [Suspension Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suspension+Field) and kept up [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke)s for the rest of the game, making it impossible for Cirigliano to stage a comeback.


**Matteo Cirigliano 1-2 Matej Zatlkaj**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsto14/qf4.jpg)*L-R: Christian Seibold (Sultai) vs. Lukas Blohon (G/B Enchantress)*




The last quarterfinal match to finish took about two hours in total. A lot of stuff happened in those games—on both sides Caryatids, Coursers, and [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen)s were cast, cards were put into graveyards, large amounts of life were gained via [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos), some creatures died, some more were reanimated—but most of that didn't really matter ...



What mattered was Blohon's constellation engine, especially [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant), which in a team effort with [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms) and [Pharika, God of Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%2C+God+of+Affliction) killed all of Seibold's creatures in the first game.


In the second, Seibold kept all [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant)s off the table via [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke)s and kept them from being reanimated with his own [Pharika, God of Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%2C+God+of+Affliction). In the end, Blohon simply ran out of cards.


In the deciding game, Blohon assembled early [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms), and Pharika, got his devotion stats high enough to start beating down with the God, and managed to resolve a total of three [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant)s ... He won.


**Christian Seibold 1-2 Lukas Blohon**
