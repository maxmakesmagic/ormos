Zombie *plants?* Oh yes. In honor of Golgari Week, today we look at some items from the *Ravnica* style guide, in the Golgari chapter.

The Golgari are the guild of reanimated rot, kudzu-encrusted corpses and mossy mausoleums. It's only fitting that one of the most basic types of Golgari foot soldier is the plant zombie, a zombie of bone and tattered flesh held together with creeping vines, moss and fungus.

Elves of a certain mindset are drawn to Guild Golgari -- those who find the usefulness of death compatible with the flourishing of life. Here are some style guide sketches of Golgari elves and some of the creatures they ride.

Here's a page full of sketches of gear and weaponry of the Golgari elfkind. Note the preponderance of improvised weapons made from dead creatures or scavenged items -- carved bone, hollowed-out shells, petrified wood, the faceplate of some unfortunate bygone wurm.
