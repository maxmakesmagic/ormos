Welcome to Multiplayer Week!


In general, *Magic* players like lists. Or maybe more specifically, arguing about lists. And way back in 2003, former Serious Fun writer Anthony Alongi catalogued not just one list to argue about, but eight, by introducing the Multiplayer Hall of Fame. A year later, he updated his lists. And now, a decade after that, current Serious Fun writer Bruce Richard has undertaken the grand venture of updating them againâ€¦with a little help from his friends.


So let's look back at the original Multiplayer Hall of Fame (or MHOF as we've been affectionately calling it), to make it easier to compare where it started and where it is today.
