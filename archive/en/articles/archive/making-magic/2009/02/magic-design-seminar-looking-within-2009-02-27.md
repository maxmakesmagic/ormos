 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 





Last November, I explained that I had begun teaching **Magic** design seminars to all interested parties in Ramp;D. I wrote a column ([**Magic** Design Seminar: The 10 Mental Locks](/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/12)) about one of the seminars and asked if you wanted me to write about any more. The feedback I received boiled down to: "Yes. This is a design column. We really like when you talk about **Magic** design."

So without further ado, I present another in my **Magic** Design Seminar series. Today's column, interestingly enough, is the very first seminar I held. Many of my other seminars are built upon this one so in retrospect I'm not sure why I didn't start with it in my column as well. 

Building Blocks
![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/mm/mm28_relearn.jpg)If you want to become a doctor, one of the first things they teach you is about the body. Not how to fix the body, that comes later, but just how the body works. Likewise, if you want to become a mechanic, you have to learn how a car works. If you want to become a writer of fiction, you have to understand how a story works. The key to learning anything always starts with understand the essence of what you are working with. **Magic** design is no difference. You want to learn about **Magic** design, you have to start by learning about **Magic: the Gathering** specifically and more generally the trading card game genre.

I'm not talking about the cards. Yes, you eventually do have to learn about the history of the game and part of that is learning what's been done before. But for today, I'm going even more basic. Today I'm going to examine what makes **Magic** itself tick. How did Richard Garfield create it? What were the challenges? What were his solutions? Today is about going to the essence of the game and gleaning an understanding of how it works. 

In the Beginning
