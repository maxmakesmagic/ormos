GRAND PRIX PROVIDENCE 2013
--------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppro13/winnershot.jpg)After an incredibly long day, consisting of five different drafts, the Finals went by in a relative blur. Andrew Longo, Eric Phillipps, and Eric Berger defeated Matt McCullough, Ari Lax, and Alex John in a quick two-set match fraught with punishing draws, aggressive openings, and stifling defense.


This trio of friends from the New York area used many of the same tricks they had used to make it to Day 2 to help them become the Grand Prix Providence champions. One of Phillipps's all-stars from his Finals deck was [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa) of Vizkopa, the same card he used to run roughshod over the Finals. Longo's Finals deck made great use of [Unflinching Courage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unflinching+Courage), which Berger had used to destroy two different drafts earlier in the day. But the biggest card in the Finals was certainly Phillipps's [Blind Obedience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Obedience), which managed to slow down the stupidly aggressive decks Lax and McCullough drafted just enough for him to take over.


This weekend was a veritable who's who of the past and present of East Coast **Magic**, and it was fitting that an East Coast team would be the ones to take home the trophy. They drafted well, they played well, and they also displayed their fair share of, well, providence on their way to becoming the newest team to take home a Grand Prix title here at Grand Prix Providence.
