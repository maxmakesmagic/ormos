Notable *Magic: The Gathering* enthusiast (and award-winning recording artist) Post Malone has entered the building. Posty is helping us celebrate 30 years of *Magic*, and that includes this *Secret Lair*—a labor of love for a lifelong fan of the game.


These two *Secret Lair x Post Malone* drops are available only for a limited time, so whether you're a Posty fan, *Magic* fan, or both [preorder them now before they're gone](https://secretlair.wizards.com/#post-malone?utm_source=daily_mtg&utm_medium=article_announcement&utm_campaign=october-superdrop-2022)!

In *Secret Lair x Post Malone: Backstage Pass*, he joined us in the tandem driver's seat to pick the cards (they're from one of his decks) and provide creative input. And to make this even more personal to Post, each card places him in a starring role. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for both Post and *Magic* fans alike, so don't delay—grab this limited-time release before it's gone for good!


*Secret Lair x Post Malone: Backstage Pass* is available in non-foil and traditional foil.

Post's *Magic: The Gathering* fandom is too big to contain in a single drop, so here's a second one! For *Secret Lair x Post Malone: The Lands*, not only did we collaborate to place his iconic tattoos into the scenery, he also handwrote the flavor text, which we then printed on every card. There are no other lands like these in the entire game—this is a totally unique way to express yourself for both fans of Posty and *Magic* alike. Get them while you can, because when these are gone, they're gone for good.


*Secret Lair x Post Malone: The Lands* is available in non-foil and traditional foil.


**Contents**:


* 1x Retro frame Plains
* 1x Retro frame Island
* 1x Retro frame Swamp
* 1x Retro frame Mountain
