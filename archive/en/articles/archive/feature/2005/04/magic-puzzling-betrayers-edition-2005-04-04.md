![Magic: The Puzzling](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/mtgcom_feature_242_pic1_en.jpg)Your worst fears and highest hopes have come true: Magic: the Puzzling is back again. This time you are running the gauntlet against some of the worst betrayers history has ever known. Do you have what it takes to annihilate Benedict Arnold? Can you come out victorious against a seemingly impervious Brutus? By fighting fire with fire and using your new cards from *Betrayers of Kamigawa*, you may just have a chance. 

### Main Puzzle

You were playing in a four-player free-for-all game and your plan was all set. You would help your best friend Brutus create an unstoppable attack force, with which he would eradicate both of the other players. Finally, as a gesture of respect to you, Brutus would concede the game, leaving you ultimate champion. After destroying your opponents, however, Brutus's greed overcame him, and he betrayed you. Your pleas for mercy did not go completely unheard, though, as Brutus promised you once more turn before his masses would come knocking at your door.

Given the seriousness of the crimes committed by this ruthless traitor, your goal is to not only kill Brutus this turn, but to also leave him with no permanents in play. 

**Your Resources:**

**Life: 14**

**Hand:** All non-lands used to complete [Puzzle 1](#p1) and non-land permanents used to complete [Puzzle 4](#p4).

You are up against a formidable enemy: Nina Myers. At the beginning of your turn, she cast [Shining Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) for six targeting you, preventing what would have been lethal damage from your [Myojin of Infinite Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Myojin%2Bof%2BInfinite%2BRage). While the situation still looks good for you, and your win next turn seems imminent, you know that Nina can be very wily, and may have you beat after all. You ponder the card you have drawn this turn ([Crack the Earth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crack+the+Earth)), and wonder if it will be enough.

### Puzzle 3

When you looked at your opening hand, you thought you were going to have the perfect game. First-turn [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) is always a great start for a Ninjutsu deck. Right off the bat, though, Lando Calrissian played a first turn [Lantern Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+Kami) and ruined all of your plans. The game has dragged on, and you've managed to reduce Lando to 6 life, but [Worship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship) is keeping him alive, and free to counterattack you at will. Destroy Lando this turn.

Also, both his [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) and [Honden of Infinite Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honden+of+Infinite+Rage) are threatening to deplete your remaining point of life.
