Let's take a trip back in time, shall we? All the way back to the time of *Judgment*, and the card [Grizzly Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Fate):

This is a centaur summoning forth bears to do his bidding. That'll work out fine for him, assuming that his bidding involves tearing and ravaging. But who is this mysterious centaur? Well, perhaps these two cards from *Odyssey* will help with the mystery!

All this is a roundabout way of explaining the original name for [Grizzly Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Fate): Seton's Call.


  
  
  
**Core Set Survivor!**There are exactly sixteen cards that have been in every core set from *Alpha* to *Tenth Edition*. When ***Magic** 2010* comes out, only *eight* cards will have been in every core set. Over the weeks before the ***Magic** 2010* prerelease, we'll be counting them down in this special Arcana sub-feature, giving you an "IN" or "OUT" on one card a day. Step forward, [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God).
