**Takashi Boku (Black/Green) vs. Chapman Sim (Blue/Red/Green)**


The first game of this match did not take long at all, unfortunately for Sim. Boku was on the play and made a [Fleshmad Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshmad+Steed) and enchanted it with [Ordeal of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Erebos) on the immediate next turn. Sim had a [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) in his hand to deal with the Steed before it became too big to matter, but he didn't have a Mountain to cast it. In fact, he didn't have any other lands in his hand, and he had to pass the turn back with a shake of his head. It wasn't long before Sim, still on two lands, just conceded a very quick Game 1.


The second game was startlingly like the first, initially. Boku once again had a [Fleshmad Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshmad+Steed) with an [Ordeal of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Erebos), and Sim, once again, didn't have a way to deal with it immediately. He took one hit from the enchanted Horse before opting to tap it down in Boku's attack step with a [Sudden Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm). This bought him a little bit of time to cast an [Ill-Tempered Cyclops](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ill-Tempered+Cyclops), but Boku just upped the ante once again. Rather than stay on the ground, he used a [Herald of Torment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Torment) to send a [Felhide Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felhide+Minotaur) to the sky, creating a 5/6 flying attacker.


Sim was in dire straits, but the time he bought with the [Sudden Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm) allowed him to make his Cyclops a Monster, taking down the Steed. He then added a [Stratus Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Walk) to make it able to block the Minotaur. Unfortunately for him, his ability to stabilize would end there. [Baleful Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Eidolon) was just enough to make the Minotaur able to successfully attack into the Cyclops. Sim didn't have anything, and the Minotaur, combined with a [Blood-Toll Harpy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Toll+Harpy), finished him off.


**Takashi Boku 2 – Chapman Sim 0**


**Hiroshi Date (Red/White) vs. Takatoshi Satou (Green/White)**
This match was far more interesting than I would ever have given it credit for being. Date began with an exposition on just how big a [Wingsteed Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) can get. The Rider hit play, picked up an [Everflame Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflame+Eidolon), and then dropped a [Fall of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fall+of+the+Hammer) on a [Snake of the Golden Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+of+the+Golden+Grove). For those keeping track at home, that's bigger than a 4/4 big. The finishing touch on this build-your-own-Baneslayer was the [Hopeful Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon), creating a 7/7 flying, [Firebreathing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebreathing), lifelinking monstrosity that you can bet finished the game right off.


The second game was just as one-sided, but in the other direction, as Satou took a [Swordwise Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swordwise+Centaur), gave it a [Feral Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Invocation) on the third turn, and just demolished Date. Anticlimactially, Date mulliganned to five cards in the final game and failed to draw more than one land for a few turns. He tried to make a game of it with a [Wingsteed Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) and [Gift of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Immortality) once he drew lands, but the damage had more than been done, Date dropping to Satou's army despite his best efforts.


**Takatoshi Satou 2 – Hiroshi Date 1**


 **Ryousuke Kasuga (Black/Red) vs. Yuuya Sugiyama (White/Red)** 
This final match was an exercise in running roughshod over an opponent. Sugiyama was on the back foot from the start. Kasuga's deck gave him a steady stream of difficult to block creatures, including [Mogis's Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%27s+Marauder), [Purphoros's Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%27s+Emissary), and [Flame-Wreathed Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame-Wreathed+Phoenix). All Sugiyama could muster for defense was a [Griffin Dreamfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Dreamfinder) bestowed with an [Observant Alseid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid). Regardless of how observant the Griffin may have become, it couldn't see the [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) that Kasuga used to finish it off during combat, clearing away his only blocker for Kasuga's Phoenix. Without a flying defender for the Phoenix or a second creature for the Emissary, Sugiyama quickly fell.


It's not often that a game is decided on the second turn, but the next game of this match certainly was. On the play, Sugiyama opened with an aggressive [Nyxborn Rollicker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Rollicker) into [Ordeal of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod), looking to run away with the game. Before that could get out of control, however, Kasuga blew Sugiyama out with a [Pharika's Cure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure). This not only got Kasuga card advantage, it also gave him the initiative. Now able to be the aggressor instead of the one reacting, Kasuga played a creature every turn, even dropping a three drop on turn five to go alongside his [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) for Sugiyama's creature. Now in complete control, Kasuga attacked and never looked back, taking the match in a quick two games.


**Ryousuke Kasuga 2 - Yuuya Sugiyama 0**
