One of your many responsibilities is writing “Making Magic.” You need to turn the column in each week in enough time for Aaron (or one of the copy editors) to edit it and create the graphics before it needs to be posted to the Web. Usually you try to stay at least a week ahead, but when you’re busy, that sometimes turns into a few days. (This article, incidentally, was turned in extra-early.)
