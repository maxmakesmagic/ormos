**Summary**   
 The ***Magic** 2012* Core Set release broke **Magic Online**’s concurrent user and activity records, continuing a pattern that began with the M10 release. The new client project continues to progress rapidly. Our current infrastructure project is a server upgrade that is bundled with an update to our eCommerce services.

**New Client**  
 The new client UI is up and running in a closed beta for select users alongside the *Innistrad* beta users. We will add more and more users to the new client in the beta environment as stability improves. Our intention is to have the new client available at the same time as the current client for some period of time when it is launched so players can make the switch at their own pace.

**Infrastructure Update**  
 The Stacked Digital Objects and Collation Update project, which also included the introduction of support for Phantom events, has accomplished its goals of significantly increasing the system’s capacity to support more users and activity. The current infrastructure project involves increasing the capabilities of our DOBS server class by running it as a 64bit application, and a complete upgrade and reorganization or our eCommerce code into appropriately modern services.

**Q3 Maintenance**  
 The Live Team continues to ship fixes to all levels of the system during our monthly maintenance builds. Their work on internal tools, reporting systems, infrastructure bugs, and such is not always visible to our customers, but is an important part of the system’s stability and usabilty. The Live Team has also done a lot of work to integrate support for the new client into the production branch.
