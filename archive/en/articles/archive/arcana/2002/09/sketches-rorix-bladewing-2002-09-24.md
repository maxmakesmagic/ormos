This week, the focus of "Sketches" is one of *Onslaught*'s [Pit Fighter Legends](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/feature/88), Rorix Bladewing by Darrell Riche

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Location: Great Pit-Arena (The Coliseum)  
Action: Champion Red Pit-Fighter. Bad-ass red scaled dragon. It's serpentine in shape (though it must have legs), and has four wings. It flies very fast."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Darrell. The only major concern was that the statue in the background looked like a Benedictine monk instead of the sinister hooded figures that were envisioned towering over the Coliseum.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece with the updated statue.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as it appears in the set.
