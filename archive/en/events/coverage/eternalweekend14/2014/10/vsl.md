 It's hard to find eight people that have access to cards like [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) on any given day. That's all changed on *Magic Online*, though. *Vintage Masters* gave people access to the Power Nine and suddenly Vintage is alive and well as a format on *Magic Online*. The sheer number of Vintage games being played right now has massively increased the velocity with which the format is evolving.




*Magic Online* streaming has also become more popular over the last year. One of the most exciting weekly streams is the Vintage Super League that's being run by Pro Tour Hall of Famer, Randy Buehler.




 Vintage Super League unites ten high-profile *Magic* players in a weekly *Magic Online* event wherein players will battle with each other while the match is commentated by two of the other players. Vintage Super League consistently provides us with a high-profile game of *Magic*. All ten players are either all-time greats, Pro Tour staples, or legitimate Vintage masters. Vintage is easily one of the most complex formats ever, and observing the beauty with which the players navigate each game is always a treat.



Rich Shay, David Williams, Steve Menendian, and Bob Maher will all be battling in today's event. I sat down with each of them to talk about Vintage Super League and The Vintage Championship.
