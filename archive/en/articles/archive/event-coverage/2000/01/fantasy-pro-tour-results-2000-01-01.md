The 2001 Pro Tour Barcelona Fantasy Pro Tour had over 1000 people participated, of which 47 picked Champion Zvi Mowshowitz (who cost 62 Pro Points). The final standings are available [here](http://archive.wizards.com/article.asp?x=PTBAR01%5C909finstands). (or the money-winners are listed farther down on this page with how many people picked each player).


The winning team earned $45,000 and was owned by someone giving their name only as "Jordan". In addition to Budde, Jordan had third-place finisher Dan Clegg. Also on the team were John Kenny, Carles Rod Martinez, Collin Hedegard, and Dan Bridy. Two potential slots were empty.


Two teams tied for second, with $43,000, both of them having Budde and Patrick Mello, who also made the Top 4. Gabriele Sikora's team was filled out with Michelle Bush, Daniel Zink, John Davis, Diego Pereira Gimenez, Gabriele Pisicchio, and Ignacio Sanchez. Marc NÃ¼bling had Xavier Curto, Daniel Zink, Papp Gabor, Jimmy Oman, Ottmar Keil, and one open slot.


In fourth place, Eric Turnquist picked Budde and Brad Swan from the Top 8, adding Abraham Snepvanger's 51st-place finish to his $39, 645 total. Kyle Rose, Kurtis Hahn, Ed Linskey, Michael Katz, and Shawn "Hammer" Regnier were also on the team.


The most popular pick was Matt Vienneau, with 237 picks Vienneau's winning streak at Limited events ran into his losing streak at European events, and the losing streak won; Vienneau finished 225th. For the second Pro Tour in a row, Olle Rade was the second-most-popular pick (190 picks, 40th place).
