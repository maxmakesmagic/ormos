Hello and welcome to another Arcana quiz! This quiz focuses on *Theros* and its top-down mythology influences. To do well on this quiz you should be up to date on the cards we've revealed from *Theros*, so be sure to visit [the card image gallery](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/theros/cig#) and have some knowledge of ancient Greek and Roman mythology before you dive into this quiz. Good luck!


A few quick notes! First off, this quiz debuts the text entry capability! So you're be able to type in the card name for the first time! Unfortunately it is English only, and spelling matters—so be careful.


Q**1. Wild and Wonderful** - The goddess Diana was the Roman goddess of nature. *Theros*'s gods are their own unique beings with different personalities and domains. However, the green god, carrying a quiver of four arrows—one for each season—is closely related to Diana. What's her name?
