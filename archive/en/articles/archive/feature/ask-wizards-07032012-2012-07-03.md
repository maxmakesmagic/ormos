Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:askwizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive, but if your question is good, it might show up in the coming weeks!


**Q:** How does the exalted mechanic work with [Geist of Saint Traft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft)?


—Tom


**A:** From **Toby Elliot**, Level 5 **Magic** Judge


 


Well! Assuming the Geist is attacking alone (initially), it will get the +1/+1 bonus no matter which order you stack the exalted and the Angel-making token abilities. That's because exalted checks for the attacking-alone condition only when it initially triggers, not when it resolves.


**Q:** If Wild Guess is the last card in my hand, can I cast it?


**A:** From the [***Magic 2013*** FAQ](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/faq/m13)


Because discarding a card is an additional cost, you can't cast Wild Guess if you have no other cards in hand.
