 When we got hold of our first W/U Heroic deck on Friday, Zac Hill began to effuse over how "gas" and "DI" the deck looked on paper.



"I honestly don't see how this deck loses to anything ever," he said without a hint of hyperbole.



 On paper, he's on to something. [Favored Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite), [Phalanx Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader), and [Battlewise Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Hoplite) make up the low end of a curve that tops out at [Eidolon of Countless Battles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Countless+Battles) and [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos). Every creature in the deck is made that much more threatening by cards like [Ordeal of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Thassa) and the various Eidolons. One of the hurdles decks like this face is the prevalence of [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), but this deck just uses [Stratus Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Walk) and [Aqueous Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form) to ignore them. It has [Gods Willing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) and [Ajani's Presence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Presence) to protect creatures from targeted removal. All of the scry triggers in the deck make it easy to avoid flooding out in longer games and keep the deck stocked full of threats. It seems like it has every advantage needed to be one of the best decks in *Theros* Block Constructed.



And yet it isn't.


Yesterday's Block Constructed rounds saw only four players make it to 4-1 or better records with the deck, with most of the players ending up 2-3 or worse. The deck was one of the top five most-played decks of the tournament, but ended up winning only barely more than 40% of the matches played. It was the worst-performing of the big decks in the field, taking us and the players who piloted the deck by surprise.


What happened to make a deck that looks as good as this on paper turn into one of the weakest-performers of the Pro Tour? About the middle of the Block Constructed rounds yesterday, I caught up with Josh Utter-Leyton to talk about what makes Block Constructed tick. He was of the opinion that W/U Heroic was the best aggressive deck that the format had to offer. After two full days of play, though, he wasn't too surprised that the deck fell flat.



 "So many of the decks in the field came prepared to deal with aggressive decks," he told me. "Cards like [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight), and [Silence the Believers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silence+the+Believers) are absolutely everywhere. Even the red decks are running [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks), and [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet). Decks like Heroic are just too susceptible to being disrupted by decks with those cards."



Still, one player managed to have a perfect day on Day One with the deck, and he doesn't think the deck is as bad as the overall results might indicate. Jared Boettcher, the current Rookie of the Year leader, played the deck to a perfect 5-0 record on Day One and had picked up yet another win by the time I talked to him on Day Two. When I asked him about how he thought he was able to do so well with the deck where others were floundering, he had a few theories.





*Jared Boettcher, current rookie of the year, was the only person to battle through Day One's Block Constructed rounds undefeated with W/U Heroic, a deck that looks great on paper but has fallen flat here at the Pro Tour.*
