What does the leader of the Golgari look like? You know, Jarad? The elf lich? Well, he can be seen on his *Return to Ravnica* card looking like this:

![Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jarad%2C+Golgari+Lich+Lord)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1116_jaradgolgarilichlord.jpg)[Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jarad%2C+Golgari+Lich+Lord) | Art by [Eric Deschamps](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Eric%20Deschamps%22%5D)

You can get another glimpse of Jarad holding court on [Jarad's Orders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jarad%27s+Orders).

![Jarad's Orders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jarad%27s+Orders)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1116_jaradsorders.jpg)[Jarad's Orders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jarad%27s+Orders) | Art by [Svetlin Velinov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Svetlin%20Velinov%22%5D)

There is actualy a third card with a great view of Jarad. And it's [Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=292771) again! But this time, it's the version from *Duel Decks: Izzet vs. Golgari*, which means this was the *first* time Jarad was seen!

And we're still not done! Because even though we've gone through all the cards that prominently feature Jarad, there's still one more piece of art: the **Magic Online** avatar!
