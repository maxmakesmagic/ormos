From Merriam-Webster Online:  
Function: adjective  

Etymology: Latin *insidiosus*, from *insidiae* ambush, from *insidEre* to sit in, sit on, from *in-* + *sedEre* to sit  

Date: 1545

- **in·sid·i·ous·ly** adverb  

- **in·sid·i·ous·ness** noun**ther·mo·karst**

![Thermokarst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thermokarst)  

From The U.S. Global Change Research Information Office:  

Function: noun  
Etymology: from Greek *thermE* heat + German *karst* irregular limestone region  
 : a range of features formed in areas of low relief when permafrost with excess ice thaws. These are unevenly distributed and include hummocks and mounds, water- filled depressions, 'drunken' forests, mud flows on sloping ground, new fens, and other forms of thaw settlement that account for many of the geotechnical and engineering problems encountered in periglacial landscapes. Even where repeated ground freezing takes place, thermokarst features, once formed, are likely to persist.**Me·ta·thran**

![Metathran Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Metathran+Elite)  

From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  

Function: noun  

Etymology: When Urza was first forming his plan to fight the Phyrexians, he decided to create artificial beings to fight the artificial beings the Phyrexians had made themselves. He called them "Metathran" after the prefix "meta-," which is often used to indicate superiority, and "Thran," which is the name of the long-dead race the Phyrexians belonged to before they turned themselves into half-mechanical monstrosities.
