Y[esterday](/en/articles/archive/stations-mural-2004-05-31) you read the story of how the four *Fifth Dawn* Stations got their art. The interchangeable mural by Greg Staples and Steve Tappin was a great success.

But the story doesn't end there. The art team liked so much what Steve Tappin did with the little pincher in the art of **[Summoning Station](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Station)**:

...that they commissioned him to do the art for the upcoming Pincher creature token card.

The Pincher token card will be available from the **Magic** Player Rewards program.
