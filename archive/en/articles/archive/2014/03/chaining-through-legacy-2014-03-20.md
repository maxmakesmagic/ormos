Legacy is a great format with a breadth of options, depending on what you're trying to do. If you're looking to play a combo deck, there are seemingly endless options, ranging from the suicidal "Oops! All Spells" to something a little more resilient, like today's deck.



![Food Chain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Food%20Chain&options=)With Food Chain and Misthollow Griffin (which is searchable via Manipulate Fate), you can create as much mana as you'd like, although you can only cast creature spells with it. As it turns out, there are some powerful creatures available in Legacy! Tidespout Tyrant can bounce all of your opponent's permanents, whereas Emrakul, the Aeons Torn might kill your opponent outright.

Some people run a heavier combo version with cards like Fierce Empath, but I like what Phil3579 has done here. Granted, I've got a soft spot for Shardless Agent, but it gives the deck a reasonable backup plan of beating down with value creatures if they stop you from assembling your combo.


Food Chain is always something I wanted to try in Legacy and Phil3579 isn't making it any easier on me. Sometimes you durdle around for a bit and sometimes you kill opponents on turn two—I'm fine with either. Plus, you get to pitch Misthollow Griffin to Force of Will for maximum value.
