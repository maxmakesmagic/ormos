*Jace Beleren is a Planeswalker who wields blue magic. His specialty is mental magic: spells of mind-reading, illusion, knowledge, and deception.*


Curiosity has always gotten the better of Jace Beleren. As a magical prodigy, he delved into lessons of sorcery deeper than the other students in mage academies, and succeeded to the point that even his instructors were suspicious of him. As a specialist in mind magic, he uses his abilities to gaze into the minds of others, discovering even closely guarded secrets. This practice has led him into danger more than once. In fact, his mind magic has helped him discover the existence of planeswalkers and of worlds beyond his own, opening his eyes to an even greater scope of secrets.


Now that Jace's own Planeswalker spark has ignited, his curiosity has begun to take him deep into the Blind Eternities, the chaotic void that holds all the planes of the Multiverse. Jace has finally found a milieu vast enough to satisfy his thirst for knowledge.


Jace now faces the same problem of every exceptional being: the temptations of power. His skills in illusion, mind-reading, and even memory modification have flourished during his travels, and they've helped him gain ever broader access to the secrets he craves.


Jace's travels have taken him back to Ravnica, where he once honed his abilities as a mind mage while working for an interplanar organization called the Infinite Consortium. Now that Jace has returned, the ten guilds have returned to prominence, and guild intrigue has reached new heights. Jace suspects a deep conspiracy involving the dragon Niv-Mizzet, a plot that leads to secrets so dangerous that Jace's mind magic might get him into more trouble than it's worth.
