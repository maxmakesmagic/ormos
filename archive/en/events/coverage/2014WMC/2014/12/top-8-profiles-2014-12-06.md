Brazil
======

Will the mighty Willy Edel leading them, the Brazilian team came in to the tournament with great expectations and unparalleled leadership. Edel is known throughout Brazil as a community stalwart and a strong organizer. Now on the team himself, and flanked by new and upcoming talent throughout the team—including Thiago Saporito, who has a Pro Tour Top 8—Brazil seemed poised to make the leap. And leap they did.

Denmark
=======


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/2014WMC/WC-20141206-3106.jpg)

Captained by Martin Müller, one of last season's Rookie of the Year contenders, Team Denmark's primary goal was getting to Day Two, which they succeeded in accomplishing, as one of the 4-3 teams to squeak in on tiebreakers. However, after back-to-back wins on Saturday, the team rallied and didn't look back, locking up the Top 8 slot after winning the second match in the stage two of team pool play.

**Grand Prix Top 8s**: 1


**Which format did you coach?** None


**What is your favorite memory from the World Magic Cup thus far?** 


Finishing 4-1 so we were locked for Day Two, the day my family showed up and cheered us on.


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?** 


Standard, Blue-Black Control


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?** 


Pride and the Pro Tour, which means I get to play more *Magic*.


**Name**: Simon Nielsen  
**Country**: Denmark  
**Hometown**: Slagelse  
**Occupation**: Top 8ing the World *Magic* Cup, apparently!  
**Pro Tour Top 8s**: 0  
**Grand Prix Top 8s**: 0


**Which format did you coach?** Standard – I have played more with all the decks than the players themselves.


**What is your favorite memory from the World Magic Cup thus far?** 


Against Serbia, we were so close to dying to their combo. They needed Springlead Drum and saw ten cards before we removed their [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy). The Drum was the eleventh. That match was so tight! Well played by the Serbians!


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?** 


Standard. Lars played Abzan Whip, Thomas played Blue-Black Control, and I mostly let Martin do his thing. Limited was fun as well, though I was very sloppy.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?** 


That would be amazing! It would show the world what a great community we have and the sweet talent-building we've got going on. Also, I'm so excited to be on the Pro Tour!

**Which format did you coach?** Team Sealed


**What is your favorite memory from the World Magic Cup thus far?** 


Going 4-1 on Day Two and realizing that we had a really strong shot at making the Top 8. Also, watching Thomas rip burn for the match twice in Team Sealed.


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?** 


Standard (of course), since I sat out during Team Sealed. I play Abzan Whip with four [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc)s to curve out better.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?** 


It would obviously be a huge deal. Our expectations were to get to Day Two, but getting back-to-back wins on Day Two really got us pumped to push for a better result. Personally, I'm past the average age for a Pro Tour player, so it feels really good to still be able to post a great finish.

England
=======


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/2014WMC/WC-20141206-3110.jpg)

England came in to Worlds Week with high hopes, but less experience than many of the other teams they'll be facing in Sunday. Captain Fabrizio Anteri is the most seasoned veteran with six Pro Tours under his belt and four Grand Prix Top 8s, but the rest of his crew are relative newcomers to the Pro Tour. But with a fervent fan base back home and strong play this weekend, there's no reason to think they can't tackle the super teams in their way.



**Name**: Fabrizio Anteri

Unified Standard, UB Control


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?** 


I couldn't imagine a better start of the first year I decide to "go pro." For the English *Magic* community, we can give them some credit and glory.

Everything. It's like the dream factory. I had so much fun testing with everyone. I never want to miss a Pro Tour again.


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?** 


Standard: I played Erebos' Zoo. The deck was pretty cool. The sideboard plan was excellent.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?** 


So much, it would mean I could go to GPs and earn a lot more. It also means I can take my friend Shellie to Washington for the Pro Tour and get to test with Neil Rigby. As for my country, I guess it would raise England's standing in the world. Thank you everyone for believing in me. You guys are the best. Love you all. PS, playmats are awesome.

Winning my first feature match (and every other match, actually)


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?** 


Unified Standard—Rabblemardu


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?** 


Since this Top 8 earned me an invitation to Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*, this could mean the start of my *Magic* career. I hope that this is a signal that the English *Magic* community is growing stronger. Since moving here, I have met a lot of good players that I am sure we will see on the Pro Tour very soon.

Limited, Temur


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?** 


For me, it would be a lifetime achievement. It's a great honor to play for England and I hope the players back home will watch and support us in the Top 8 tomorrow.



Greece
======


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/2014WMC/WC-20141206-3117.jpg)

This is a Top 8 filled with underdogs, and Greece certainly fits that bill. Exactly 32 teams made it into Day Two, and Greece was at the bottom of that list, just barely edging out Japan and Germany on tiebreakers. The Greeks made the most of their opportunity, making an incredible run to the Top 8.

**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?** Since it's my first tournament outside of Greece it would be really awesome. Our country has never made Top 8 in a World Cup it's important too!

Serbia
======


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/2014WMC/WC-20141206-3104.jpg)

Serbia set itself up for success with strong eighth-place finish on Day One. They continued that run through Team Sealed on Saturday and then saw their Top 8 hopes come down to a final match against the Netherlands, one which Serbia narrowly pulled out to punch its ticket to Sunday.

Slovak Republic
===============


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/2014WMC/WC-20141206-3100.jpg)

The 2010 Team World Championship in Chiba wasn't just a fluke, according to every member of the deep team from the Slovak Republic. Pro Tour *Magic* 2015 winner Ivan Floch, himself a member of that team, was joined by two-time Pro Tour Top 8 player and winner of Grand Prix Stockholm Mataj Zatlkaj and the 2006 World Championship Top 8 contender Jan Tomcani. The skill and depth of team Slovak Republic made them one of the teams to watch over the weekend, and they've delivered for their countryman at home. Adding a second team title would indisputably confirm to everyone else what they already attested themselves.

South Korea
===========


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/2014WMC/WC-20141206-3111.jpg)

With a World Championship competitor at the helm, the team from South Korea has heralded the age of the Korean player. Nam Sung Wook, team captain, played to victory at Grand Prix Melbourne and a finalist finish at Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* with the help of a pan-Asian team of similarly successful Pro Tour players. Taking both what he learned from a larger testing group and the support of team Hong Hong home to his teammates in South Korea, the team demonstrated just what they were now capable of after two days of play: South Korea is now at the top of the list of dangerous and powerful World *Magic* Cup teams.

**What is your favorite memory from the World Magic Cup thus far?** When I cast [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and looted off [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) only to momentarily forget to draw three. I hear [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) is a good card.


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?** Team Sealed. I played blue-green terrible cards and then an insanely powerful Jeskai tempo deck.


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?** The USA has been cheering us on from home and has made it clear that they want nothing less than for us to bring home the gold. We're doing our best to make that happen!

**What is your favorite memory from the World Magic Cup thus far?** It's a tie between reminding Neal to draw his three cards from [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and Andrew going runner-runner off his [Stratus Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Walk) to win the penultimate match in Round 6.


**Which format was your favorite to play, and what deck did you play in that format?** Sealed, I had mono [Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast).


**What would winning the World Magic Cup mean to you and your country?** It means I would be five points away from Silver. I would play a lot more Grand Prix, and I'd have a chance at Rookie of the Year.
