*by Will McDermott*
The Mirari has bounced around from owner to owner, from zealous aven leaders to unstable dementia summoners. Now it has finally come into the hands of the man whoâ€™s been seeking it for the duration of two expansions: Kamahl. What he does with it is another question entirely.

In *Judgment*, The powerful forces of white and green ascend to counter the black dominance of the *Torment* expansion. The Mirari has changed hands and Kamahl, who has been instructed to talk to the Nantuko and learn the ways of the druids, now wields the vastly powerful artifact.




---

*Judgment* brings five powerful Wish cards that allow you to get any card you own and put it into your hand. A dream strategy. Combined with deadly Phantoms, *Judgment* sets right the color imbalance created by *Torment*.


Deep within the Krosan Forest, the final showdown for the Mirari will begin. Not everyone will emerge alive. No one will emerge unchanged.  
**The time of *Judgment* is here.  

May your wishes come true.**
