 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 






Since Grand Prix Prague at the end of January, we've had three straight weekends of live video coverage from *Magic* tournaments all around the world. We're not close to done with Q1 of 2017, either, because we've got another *seven* weekends in a row where we're bringing you the latest from premier events all over the globe.


The Next Seven Weeks of Coverage
================================


I won't waste any time; instead I'll just jump straight into what you can expect from the next seven weekends of live video.


**February 17–19**: [Grand Prix Brisbane](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpbri17) and [Vancouver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpvan17)  
**Live Video from**: Grand Prix Vancouver ([twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic))  
**Start Times**: Saturday, February 18 (9 a.m. PT/2 p.m. UTC), and Sunday, February 19 (9 a.m. PT/2 p.m. UTC)  
**Video Producer**: Rich Hagon  
**Video Director**: Rashad Miller  
**Camera and Graphics**: Garth Avery  
**Play-by-Play Commentators**: Marshall Sutcliffe  
**Color Commentators**: Paul Cheon  
**Writer-Reporters**: Ray Walkinshaw (Brisbane), Hallie Santo (Vancouver)


Beginning at Grand Prix Vancouver and continuing at a few Grand Prix for the next couple of weeks, we'll be trying a new approach with our coverage. Live matches will be commentated by Marshall and Paul, while Rich Hagon will be in the booth for Time Walk with select special guests from the Grand Prix who will come in to provide analysis with him on recorded matches.


These guests can range from pro players to deck specialists to the winners of the Time Walk match, and they'll break down their thought process play by play. We'll be trying a mixture of different guests and look forward to bringing some new faces into the booth!

While our regular coverage crew works out of Barcelona, ChannelFireball will be sending its production crew to New Jersey to keep the show going once Barcelona has wrapped up for each day. It's two GPs at one home—our *Magic* Twitch Channel—as we bring you action that starts early and ends late!
