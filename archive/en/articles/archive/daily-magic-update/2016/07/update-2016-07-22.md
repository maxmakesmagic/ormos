The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 22, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by *Eldritch Moon*. It's here and it wants your brains.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

You, too, can start cracking packs today as *Eldritch Moon* releases everywhere. Or has already released if you're in the part of the world that lives in the future. Also, future people, can we get a little heads-up when the robots take over?


1. [#KenjiWayfinder](https://twitter.com/hashtag/KenjiWayfinder?src=hash)

#KenjiWayfinder, whereing Kenji Tsumura posts a ton of decklists on Twitter featuring new cards, has started! If you're looking for brews or simple updates to existing archetypes, Kenji has it all.


Today's Must
============


1. [Spirits, Dragons, and Humans](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13409&writer=Craig+Wescoe&articledate=7-22-2016) | TCGPlayer | Craig Wescoe

Yes, Wescoe, like everyone else, thinks Spirits are the real deal. But he also sees improvements gained for Humans and...Dragons? We're a long way removed from *Dragons of Tarkir*, but not so far that Wescoe doesn't see them roaring back to life for one final go-round.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Eldritch Moon* Constructed Set Review: Green](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/eldritch-moon-constructed-set-review-green/) | ChannelFireball | Reid Duke

We're nearing the home stretch with the ~~LSV~~ Reid Duke Constructed reviews for *Eldritch Moon*, as Duke finishes up the last of the five colors. Multicolor, lands, colorless, and artifacts are still to come. But in the meantime, you should definitely read this one—and if you still haven't yet, you should definitely read the other colors Duke has already reviewed.


1. [What's the Pick? *Eldritch Moon* Pack 1 Pick 1 with Huey](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/whats-the-pick-eldritch-moon-pack-1-pick-1-with-huey-3/) | ChannelFireball | William Jensen

There are going to be a lot of drafts firing this weekend, so why not stop by Huey's place and pick up a few pointers before you jump in? This is the third in Jensen's *Eldritch Moon* series, so be sure to check out [the other two](http://www.channelfireball.com/tag/pack-1-pick-1-with-huey/) as well.


1. [How an AI Will Help You Draft the Perfect *Magic: The Gathering* Deck](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/magic-the-gathering-eldritch-moon-ai) | Motherboard | Bryson Masse

So did we skip the part where AI takes over the world and go right to them giving friendly Draft advice? Or does that come first? I think I missed the part of *Terminator* where Skynet drafts *Eldritch Moon*.


1. [Ross VS. Majors: Blue-Red Control VS. Sultai Midrange](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33335_Ross-VS-Majors-.html) | StarCityGames.com | Ross Merriam and Michael Majors

Value, value, value. Watch as Ross Merriam (Blue-Red Control) and Michael Majors (Sultai Midrange) try to out-value each other in another installment of the Versus series.


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [StarCityGames.com Columbus Open](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/230716_columbus_fact_sheet.html)

*Eldritch Moon* comes out today, but tomorrow people will be battling with Standard at the Columbus Open. I'm always amazed when people have full, functioning decks the day after a new set is released, so it'll be interesting to see what people bring to the Open. Will they hold on to old favorites? Will new powerhouses be discovered? Will Patrick Sullivan and Cedric Phillips look good in their suits? We know the answer to at least one of those questions (obviously), but tune in to see what Standard looks like on literal Day Two of the format at [twitch.tv/scglive](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive) starting at 10:30 a.m. ET/7:30 a.m. PT.


1. *Jeopardy*

Yeah, like, actual *Jeopardy*. Check your local listings and all that, but StarCityGames.com writer Ross Merriam (you can listen to Cedric Phillips interview him [here](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33332_CEDTalks-Ross-Merriam.html)) is going to be on *Jeopardy* today (Friday). I want to tune in just to hear him describe to Alex Trebek what he does for a living.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Painful Truths](http://www.cardconfidants.com/podcast/painful-truths-8-scg-columbus-primer/) | Zach Allen, Raja Sulaiman, Brian DeMars, Andrew Elenbogen, and Tyler Hill

Painful Truths is a relatively new podcast (the [most recent episode, released yesterday, is Episode 8](http://www.cardconfidants.com/podcast/painful-truths-8-scg-columbus-primer/)) focused on competitive play based out of RIW Hobbies in Michigan. For anyone who doesn't know RIW Hobbies, they've occasionally sponsored Pro Teams (former National Champion and Team World Champion Michael Jacob was among their members) and are known as a solid center for strong players. You can find an archive of [the podcasts here](http://www.cardconfidants.com/series/painful-truths/), but the most recent one goes over what the team expects to happen at StarCityGames.com Columbus.


Decks of the Day
================


1. [Eldritch Evolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldritch+Evolution)

#KenjiWayfinder is a wealth of deck brews, so why waste it? This is one of the coolest new decks they showed off today—[Eldritch Evolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldritch+Evolution).


The deck, which [you can see in picture form here](https://twitter.com/hareruyaEnglish/status/756398500527550464), isn't trying to break [Eldritch Evolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldritch+Evolution)—it's just trying to use it in a toolbox-style deck that can turn smaller value creatures into larger, well, still value creatures. It has a lot of creatures that provide value, and [Eldritch Evolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldritch+Evolution) kind of works like a one-shot [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) that gets to skip a turn.


[Eldritch Evolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldritch+Evolution) seems to be one of those cards people expect to be strong, but no one has a definitive answer how yet. This could be a solid attempt at just such a thing.
