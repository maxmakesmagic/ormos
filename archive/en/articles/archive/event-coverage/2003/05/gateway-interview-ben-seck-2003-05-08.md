Today marks the last Masters Gateway, as players battle through a single elimination tournament, fighting for a spot in the Masters and the guaranteed $2000 that goes along with it. Obviously, most players would be more inclined to prepare for the Pro Tour than the Gateway, so historically "stock" decks are plentiful. There are usually a few creative, innovative decks, but they're scarce unless the format is not established. Back at the Chicago Gateway, Australia's Ben Seck played a unique Reanimator deck, and today he has yet again created a deck that has caught the attention of the convention hall. It's a white-red [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide) deck that is very similar to the Standard builds, with one striking difference: [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator). This powerful artifact lets him cycle through his deck even faster, triggering [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide) for free and [Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) for one mana total. The addition of Urza's Saga cycling lands makes the deck even more powerful.

![Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fluctuator)**Sideboard:** How did you come up with the deck idea?  
**Seck:** Back in Australia, everyone thinks [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator) is banned! For some reason the banned lists are kind of murky, especially for a card like [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator). There were a lot of people here yesterday and today who told me they thought it was banned. With all the cycling in the new set, there seemed to at least be some sort of synergy. I only started brainstorming with the deck about three or four days ago. Going with the basis of the Standard deck, it just kind of evolved from there. The biggest advantage you get is [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator), obviously, and the addition of twelve cycling lands between [Blasted Landscape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasted+Landscape) and the red and white ones. **Sideboard:** Is the basic goal the same as the Standard deck, or are there any differences?   
**Seck:** It's just much quicker. [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator) is really crucial to this deck. The Standard deck has (Exalted) Angels, and I have no Angels maindeck. Basically, because Angels are too slow in this format for what they need to do. I have too many lands that come into play tapped and things like that. I found that against Lackey or any sort of Sligh, (the Angels) just never got to unmorph, and [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide) is pretty much a luxury against that deck. You don't have time to cast it, you have to cycle [Slice and Dice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+and+Dice) and [Gempalm Incinerator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Incinerator)s first. 

**Sideboard:** Can the deck go off pretty fast with [Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) once you get [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator) out?  
**Seck:** Once you've stabilized the board with the Rifts or the Slide, and you have a Rift down, you can kill them within two or three turns without having any pressure on you. The good thing is, the Rift is creature control as well as the win condition. 

**Sideboard:** You have some random cards in the deck too, like Radiant's...  
**Seck:** There's two [Radiant's *Judgment*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant%27s+Judgment), two [Scrap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrap)s and one [Clear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clear). Basically, I needed to find two-mana cycling cards that would work well with [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator). Otherwise, there wouldn't be any point if I were running cards from the Standard cycling deck like [Akroma's Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Blessing) and cards like that. So I was just looking at the metagame, and looking at which cards could possibly be used. [Clear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clear), there's only a single one, but if you have [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator) out and you need to get rid of a (Pernicious) Deed, you can just search for it. [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator) is like a cheater card. [Scrap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrap) is mostly against [Cursed Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll) if I can't stabilize, but in theory it's good against [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker). That's a minor thing though. The numbers of [Scrap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrap)s and [Clear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clear)s are pretty arbitrary.

[Radiant's *Judgment*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant%27s+Judgment) is actually not too bad in this format with people running (Goblin) Goon, blue/green has [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar) tokens and [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm)s, [Spiritmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger) if they decide you can't kill it and [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth). There're quite a few targets for it. Then you have Disciples of Law, which are basically a metagame call. What I've found about this Masters is that I think a lot of people haven't done much work for it. So, they default and go to Sligh or blue-green, and this deck's best matchups are theoretically against those decks. It's not that great against Rock since [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) pretty much destroys it. But, Rock isn't a popular deck and if you face it, well, this is a Gateway so you're going to have to make some calls somewhere.

**Sideboard:** What happens if someone [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s or destroys the [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator)?  
**Seck:** I didn't have [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator) in the second game (of the first round, which Seck won.) It just works like a normal Slide deck. It's a little faster, it has [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond)s, but Slide decks can work without [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator). If someone decides to attack the [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator), they can't attack a Slide or Rift. They can attack one part, and the other part of the deck will kick in. 

![Stoic Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stoic+Champion)**Sideboard:** How about the Sideboard? [Stoic Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Champion) seems really good.  
**Seck:** Initially when I started building the deck, it was all about trying to get a quick kill with [Stoic Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Champion). You could go first turn [Stoic Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Champion), second turn [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator) and just kill them, nearly straight up. It just didn't happen that often. They weren't very good in many matchups, and a lot of times you just needed more cycling cards or whatever. So what I've decided to do is have a bit of a transitional sideboard. All of the cards kind of work well with the deck anyway. [Flametongue Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu) can obviously do four more (with [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide)), [Stoic Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Champion) can be big, I have [True Believer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True+Believer) which is my only concession if I do play against a Rock deck. It protects me from Edicts, [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel)s are just good.**Sideboard:** Anything else our readers should know?  
**Seck:** The deck choice, I'm not sure how stable it is in the long term. In the current tournament scene, I think it's a viable deck choice. For the people watching at home, if they want a fun deck to play, this is it.

**Sideboard:** Yeah, I could tell. You were smiling the whole time last round.  
**Seck:** It doesn't matter if I actually do well with this deck. Historically I used to play a lot of funky decks, and then as I started getting more success in general with Magic, I became more conservative with my deck choices. Just recently at (Australian) Nationals, I went 6-0 in the draft, and 0-4 for the first rounds of Constructed. I played blue/green, because I only needed two wins and a draw (to make Top 8). I've decided, well look, I might as well go with what I know and play a funky deck. Even if I don't do so well, at least I'll have fun along the way.
