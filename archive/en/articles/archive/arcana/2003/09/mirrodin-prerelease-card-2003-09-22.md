If you attended the *Mirrodin* prerelease tournament this past weekend, then you should have a prerelease card in your possession. If not, here's what you missed out on:

![Sword of Kaldra](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/articles/swordkaldra.jpg)

The card is Sword of Kaldra, a rare artifact Equipment. The prerelease version has different art than the version in the set. The *Mirrodin* expansion symbol is foiled in the text box, and the date (20 Sept 03) is stamped above the type line in gold leaf.
