| **Anton Jonsson**, Sweden: "I have to say Sweden. We have guys like Thomas [Rosholm] and Jens [Thorén], so of course we're the best." | **Svend Geertsen**, Denmark: "Denmark, we have so much potential." | **Alexander Witt**, The Netherlands: "The Netherlands. We have more good players, Germany has only one." |

**"Germany or Brazil?"**

| **Tommi Hovi**, Finland: "Brazil. It is more fun to watch Brazil play." | **Jim Herold**, Germany: "Hopefully Germany, but I think it will be hard for them. Brazil has a strong team, and while Germany fight well, they have limited technique." | **Sigurd Eskeland**, Norway: "I root for Oliver Kahn. He would be a bad guy of Magic if he played." |

**"What is the best thing about having the 2002 European Championship in Amsterdam?"**
