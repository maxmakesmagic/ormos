After fifteen rounds of Legacy, with 1,385 others eliminated, just eight players remained in the running for the fame and the glory, the trophy and the title. About time to get acquainted with these people!

Lands.

[Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths). Or maybe [Crop Rotation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crop+Rotation) because it finds me [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths).

[Sphere of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Resistance).

Went on to take 16 damage from the Chasm while my opponent decked himself.

**Age:** 28



**Hometown:** Ghent, Belgium



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Won a FNM.



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


4-Color Delver. Baptist told me to.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time).



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast). Everyone plays blue.

### Petr Sochůrek


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gplil15/gplil15_t8_sochurek.jpg)



**Age:** 21



**Hometown:** Prague, Czech Republic



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Played in five Pro Tours, made Top 16 in Valencia. Several money finishes at Grand Prix and Pro Tours. Silver level.



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


4-Color Delver. The deck is nuts.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). It's worse than [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) but still totally busted. It turns your previously bad matchups into great ones.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast). It's just so efficient.



**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**


Cast [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) on my Merfolk opponent on turn two and later won because of it.

### Claudio Bonanni

**Age:** 26



**Hometown:** Cesena, Italy



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Some Top 8s in Italy and one Day 2 finishs at Grand Prix Paris.



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


Mentor Miracles, because I love [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor). It's insane.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor). It can win so fast.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


I think [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon). It's that card you want to sideboard against strange decks.



**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**


Against Omni-Tell, I cast [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique), he responded with [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), and I revealed my own [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) with [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance). A blind hit! So cool!

### Ricardo Sánchez

**Age:** 21



**Hometown:** Madrid, Spain



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Cashed at some Grand Prix. Top 100 at Pro Tour Journey into Nyx.



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


Infect. I don't normally play Legacy and I thought it would be a great choice because you don't care too much about what is happening on the other side of the table.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


The same [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch)s my friend used to Top 4 Grand Prix Madrid last year.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


Probably the fourth [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will). It was great to have against the combo decks.



**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**


When I killed through a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) on turn two on a mulligan to five.

### Christoph Alsheimer

**Age:** 25



**Hometown:** Fürth, Germany



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Top 32 at Grand Prix Amsterdam.



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


4-Color Loam by Niklas Kronberger. I played it because my [Doomsday](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomsday) list was terrible in testing. Also, Niklas convinced me to play it.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). It's a super flexible tutor/beater.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


 wins the horrible matchups.



**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**


Honestly, I don't remember anything special.

### Olivier Ruel


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gplil15/gplil15_t8_ruel.jpg)



**Age:** 33.9



**Hometown:** Lille, France



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Lots back in the days. In the last five years, I won some drafts on Magic Online.



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


Miracles, because the archetype is pretty strong and the deck is quite interesting to play. My version is not that good though.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), but I doubt you need an explanation for that.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest), because it's so good against [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens). , because it costs 1,2, and 3 … or so I thought.



**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**


An intentional draw into eighth and ninth place which a miracle turned into seventh and eighth.

### Jaroslav Boucek

**Age:** 27



**Hometown:** Samotišky, Czech Republic



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Grand Prix Top 32 and Grand Prix Top 64.



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


4-Color Aggro Loam by Niklas Kronberger. Big props to him. A great and enjoyable deck.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void). Makes games a lot easier.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Choke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choke).



**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**


Probably some [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) shenanigans.
