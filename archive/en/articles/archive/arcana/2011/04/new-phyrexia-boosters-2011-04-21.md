Imagine that it's the future. Not too far in the future. Maybe only a few short weeks. And you're in your local game store. That doesn't seem too implausible so far, right? Great. So you're in a game store and you look around. And you see this:

Do you know what that is? That's a display box of 36 *New Phyrexia* boosters. That's how you know it's the future. You're intrigued. You pick up one of the booster packs to get a closer look at it.

Then you pick up another.

And another.

Your eyes are dazzled with these visions. The room seems to spin. And you find yourself back in the present, with only these pictures to remind you of what *New Phyrexia* will look like. In the future.


(Note: If you're reading this Arcana from the actual future, we apologize for it not making any sense. But since you live in a fantastic technological wonderland of hovercats and laserdogs, you're probably not too depressed about it.)
