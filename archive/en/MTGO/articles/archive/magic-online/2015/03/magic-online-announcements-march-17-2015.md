**Build Notes**


**General Fixes**



* Customer Service Help System account links have been updated to go to the correct pages
* The *Magic Online* account system will now e-mail a player when they do not fully complete the account sign-up process. This fixes an issue where user’s would not be able to claim their chosen username if interrupted during the account sign-up process.
* On the Home Scene, when you block a buddy, they will no longer be removed from your buddy list until you choose that option. A blocked player still cannot interact with you in any fashion.


**Crash and Performance Fixes**



* Fixed a memory leak issue that was causing system resources to not be properly released after a draft completed.
* Fixed a memory leak issue where navigating between decks in the Collection scene would not correctly release system resources even after a period of inactivity or a scene change.
* Fixed an issue that would occasionally cause players in large tournaments to crash in the later rounds while on the Event Details screen
* While in pile view, dragging a card with higher mana cost into a binder sorted by mana cost with only lower mana cost cards no longer causes a crash
* Players will no longer crash if the draft they are in is deleted while they are on the Draft Scene


**Gameplay and Event Fixes**



* The lower left pane in the Event details window now shows how many matches are outstanding in the round and updates automatically as matches finish
* Scrying Glass no longer replaces a user choice of 1 with a choice of 0
* When disconnected during sideboarding, upon returning, you now go to the Sideboard Scene as intended
* The concede game option now takes placement priority in front of the "Make a Selection" box when they are both active


**Look and Feel Fixes**



* Power and toughness are now easier to see due to a newly added 1-pixel drop shadow on pre-Eighth Edition card frames
* In Pile View in the Collection Scene, split cards and split cards with Fuse now sort into the pile on the left half of the card
* Fixed an issue where the chat window sticks on the background if the user closes *Magic Online* while replaying a game
* Fixed an issue where a user defined custom set of columns in the List View reset to default after navigating away from the Collection Scene then back to it
* Fixed an issue where the “Move Selected to Deck” context menu item did not function when it was used in the Sideboard pane, set to the List View mode
* Fixed an issue that would cause some right-click context menus to begin with a blank line
* In the Play Lobby, the Recent Play menu now functions properly
