Today we follow up on our [earlier look](/en/articles/archive/alternate-chinese-art-guildpact-part-1-2006-02-23) at alternate Chinese art in *Guildpact*. The art of these cards was modified for the Chinese market due to its restrictions on the depiction of human skeletons and other imagery.


Here's one the four cards modified: **[Scab-Clan Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scab-Clan+Mauler)**. The art has a skull in the foreground, which was altered very subtly so as to obscure the nose cavity of the skull.

The final piece modified for the Chinese market was, of course, **[Skeletal Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Vampire)**. The very concept of the card is a bare skeleton shown front-and-center, so it obviously needed modification. The resulting art is dramatic but still cool-looking -- click the links below to see the image change.

As you can see, the art team did a nice job of covering up our bony friend while keeping the sense that he's a relentless -- and still reasonably skeletal -- bloodsucker.
