The semifinals featured four players from four different countries all competing with different strategies across multiple formats. However, the format for the Semifinals, and the primary point of focus for the competitors, is Standard Constructed.



With that said, let's delve into the highlights of each match.



**Jasper De Jong vs. Antonio Del Moral Le****ón**



The first match of the semifinals pitted Jasper De Jong's Green-White Devotion deck against Antonio Del Moral León's Abzan Midrange strategy.



In the first game, De Jong had a solid start with [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) into [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), but Del Moral León's aggressive start with a [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and a [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) made his creature a 4/4, ensured the Courser hit the graveyard, and gave him a sizable clock to go with his fourth-turn [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino).

*Antonio Del Moral León fired forward with an aggressive start.*



However, on the back of multiple Coursers and a [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental), as well as a second [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) and a [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector), De Jong was able to gain enough life and keep enough action flowing that he could grind the game to a halt.



And when a game with two [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen)s grinds to a halt, things don't look for the Abzan player. Multiple triggers brought De Jong upwards of 60 life, and [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) combined with cards like [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) and the two-mana enchantment's activated ability to ensure that Del Moral León had no way to come back.



However, the win for De Jong left him with only 11 minutes on his 25-minute clock for the match. If Del Moral León took a second game, De Jong would find himself hard-pressed to finish the match before his time ran out.



However, Game 2 was played and won at a blistering pace by Del Moral León, ensuring that the clock factor would likely not play a factor.

*Jasper De Jong spent a lot of time on the first game, but that wasn't the case for the post-board games.*



And sure enough, it didn't. In the third and final game, Del Moral León's keep in the third game left him on a mulligan, a weak keep, and unfortunately couldn't find enough lands to cast his expensive spells as De Jong quickly ran over his opponent.



The final result: Jasper De Jong defeated Antonio Del Moral León 2-1, advancing to the finals.



**Magnus Lantto vs. Aleksa Telarov**



The first game of the semifinal match between Magnus Lantto and Aleksa Telarov featured a land-light hand from Lantto and some tough [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) decisions from Telarov.



Ultimately Telarov left Lantto with a threat-heavy hand after multiple [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)s, then he answered Lantto's multiple [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental)s via a [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut) as well as a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) returned off of a [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector). The play left Lantto with only a [Genesis Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Hydra). [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) from Telarov left Lantto with the Hydra as his only option.

*Lantto was left with little in the way of options for the first game.*



That [Genesis Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Hydra) only found Lantto a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), and [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) crunched over a couple of times to move the match to Game 2.



The second game, however, had those [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental)s entering the battlefield instead against Telarov's slow hand. While Telarov had a [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) for the first, he had to fire off a [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate) against the second, leaving Lantto with three manifests.



However, the manifests were relative blanks. While one turned up to reveal a [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) when Telarov blocked, [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) made quick work of the rest. While Telarov was low on life, a [Read the Bones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones) elicited a smile from him, as he found, cast face-down, and unmorphed [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector). This allowed him to return the Crux of Fate against Lantto's [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker), leaving Telarov with a very hungry dragonlord and an opponent on the verge of defeat.



However, [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) left Lantto with a bit of gas. And when Telarov made a greedy attack at Lantto, leaving the Xenagos on the table, Lantto had enough mana on the next turn when he top-decked [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) to play it as a morph, turn it face-up, cast [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker), and use the green Planeswalker's ability to animate a land. This left Telarov having to chump-block the 4/4 trampling land with a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) to stay alive.



![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/mtgochamp14/mtgochamp14sf_telarov.jpg)  
*Aleksa Telarov's choice of what to attack with [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) was a decision that would come back to haunt him.*



While Telarov had a second [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) in hand, he did not have enough blockers, a [Plummet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet) off the top sent Telarov crashing back down into reality, with a limited amount of time left on his clock and a move into a third game that he may well have prevented with a different attack.



And sure enough, that attack would come back to haunt him. His hand in the third game was less than stellar, and when Lantto found a [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) waiting for him off the top on the third turn to go with his [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), Telarov had his back against the wall and with three minutes on the clock.



[Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) off the top kept the pressure up, and while Telarov had [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate), it still left Lantto with a manifest and the Xenagos. Attacks dropped Telarov to 5, and [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker) left Telarov offering the handshake.



The final result: Magnus Lantto defeated Aleksa Telarov 2-1, advancing to the finals.
