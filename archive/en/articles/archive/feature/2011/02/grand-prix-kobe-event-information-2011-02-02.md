**UPDATE MARCH 17, 2011**: Grand Prix Kobe has been postponed following Friday’s magnitude 9.0 earthquake and resulting tsunami in Japan. Originally to be held March 19-20, the Grand Prix has been rescheduled to April 23-24, 2011.

Due to significant safety, power, and travel concerns across the eastern portion of the country as well as a national call to conserve resources, Wizards of the Coast believes it is not appropriate to continue with the event as scheduled. We extend our thoughts and sympathies to all those affected by the disaster. 

For information about how you can help, visit [www.redcross.org](http://www.redcross.org) and donate to Japan Earthquake and Pacific Tsunami.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/promo/grandprix_2011.jpg)*Get your free promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).*Kobe is a city rich with **Magic** history, having hosted the first Pro Tour to be won by a Japanese player (Masashiro Kuroda, 2004) and the largest Grand Prix in Japan to date (1350 players, 2001). This will be the fourth Grand Prix held in Kobe.


Kobe is the fifth-largest city in Japan, with a population of approximately 1.5 million. One of the first cities to open for trade with the West following the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1868, Kobe has long been known as a cosmopolitan port city. The city is the point of origin and namesake of Kobe beef as well as the home of one of Japan's most famous hot spring resorts, the Arima Onsen. Other well-known locations in the city include the Ikuta Shrine, the Kobe Port Tower, and its large Chinatown.


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#1).*

 A player who has a bye in a round does not have to play a match in that round, but is treated as having won. A bye is normally given out to a player when there are an odd number of players in a round, but byes may also be rewarded to players for previous performance at a tournament or as a prize at a Trial tournament. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria *(Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players that accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds)*:

* Players with a [Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) level of 4 or higher

* Winners of Grand Prix Kobe Trial tournaments.

**Second-Round Byes** 
  


* Players with a [Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) level of 2 or 3

### Artist Information


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpkob11/StevePortfolioReview.jpg)**Steve Argyle**
  
 Amid a labyrinth of empty soda cans and books, Steve Argyle can often be found scribbling away by the glow of a computer monitor. Steve Argyle has been creating powerful imagery for **Magic** for four years. New, but working hard to establish himself among the pantheon of **Magic** artists. Iconic cards such as [Chandra Ablaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Ablaze), [Admonition Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Admonition+Angel), [Slave of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slave+of+Bolas), and [Everflowing Chalice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) are his handiwork. Additionally, Steve adds flair to old favorites with promo art, such as the FNM [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), the Pre-Release [Glissa, the Traitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa%2C+the+Traitor), Promotional [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel), and his very first **Magic** card, Player Rewards Textless [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). And Steve is just getting started. He couldn't be more excited about coming to the Kobe Grand Prix, and meeting with the players, who are the reason he works so hard on his art. You can check out most of it on his website, [www.steveargyle.com](http://www.steveargyle.com).
