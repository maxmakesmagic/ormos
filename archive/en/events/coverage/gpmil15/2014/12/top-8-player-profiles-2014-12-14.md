After sixteen rounds of Modern, only eight players remained in the running for the title of Grand Prix champion. About time to get to know them a little better, isn't it?

### Piotr Głogowski


**Age:** 19


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Poznań, Poland


**Clan:** Abzan, I think. I really love [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino).


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Not much. Some Grand Prix Trial wins here and there.


**What deck did you play and why?**


I play [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor) Combo. I chose it because I had a lot of practice with the deck. Most people think it's really bad and don't prepare for it at all, making it even better.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I think my decklist is fine and I wouldn't change anything. Maybe I'll try something like [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), but I don't have high hopes.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)!

### Miguel Gatica


**Age:** 24


**Occupation:** Magic player/entrepreneur


**Hometown:** San Jose, Costa Rica


**Clan:** Temur


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


12th at Pro Tour Return to Ravnica, four-time national champion, 89 lifetime Pro Points before this. BFF with Christian Calcano, Eric Kreiter, and Daniel Gardner.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Temur Delver. I'm playing real decks now, not Bogles.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I'd probably cut the two [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge)s from my sideboard as I didn't board them in at all during the tournament. Probably add one [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) and one [Destructive Revelry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Revelry).


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise).

### Eduardo Sajgalik


**Age:** 26


**Occupation:** Seeking employment


**Hometown:** Moving out of Plymouth, United Kingdom


**Clan:** Jeskai


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Top 8 at Pro Tour Return to Ravnica, Top 8 at Grand Prix Barcelona 2011, four Nationals Top 8s out of five attempts; played for Canada, Great Britain, and England.


**What deck did you play and why?**


[Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) with green, built in conjunction with Joao [Choc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choc)a. I like the speed and resilience gained with green (Birds of Paradise get boarded out against red decks.) It's harder to disrupt with extraction effects and a wish board is very powerful. Also, Ascendancy and [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) are broken!


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


No more changes. [Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter) Pact and [Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silence) are flexible but felt right.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy), of course.

### Magnus Lantto


**Age:** 33


**Occupation:** Manager


**Hometown:** Malmö, Sweden


**Clan:** Abzan


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Been on a long break from live Magic but an accomplished online grinder and qualified for the 2014 MOCS final and Pro Tour Dragons of Tarkir.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Been playing [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) for about six months and counted about 600 online matches with it during that time.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


None to the main deck, possibly more cards against Affinity in the sideboard. Affinity was more popular than I expected.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod)!

### Louis Deltour


**Age:** 22


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Paris, France


**Clan:** Jeskai obviously.


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Two Grand Prix Top 8s, French Nationals Top 8 in 2009.


**What deck did you play and why?**


[Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy). I immediately picked it up on Magic Online when I saw it on the World Championship stream and I wasn't disappointed. The deck's really hard to play but also to play against, which gave me a huge edge, especially since it's so new.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


A few sideboard tweaks maybe. The [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) package isn't good against blue decks, so if you expect a lot of them consider [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) and [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer).


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) is the best card deck but you obviously need the deck's namesake card to make the best out of it.

### Niccolo Bellini


**Age:** 23


**Occupation:** Working in a technical office


**Hometown:** Mantova, Italy


**Clan:** Sultai


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Nothing of real importance.


**What deck did you play and why?**


[Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) because I love [Thragtusk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk).


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Maybe splash red to add [Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter) Games to the sideboard.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod).

**Age:** 36


**Occupation:** IT


**Hometown:** Milan, Italy


**Clan:** Mardu


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


15 Pro Tour participations, two money finishes.


**What deck did you play and why?**


"Real" Affinity, good in this metagame.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Maybe some sideboard cards.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal).

### Lucantonio Salvidio


**Age:** 30


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Cosenza, Italy


**Clan:** Mardu


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Top 8 at a Pro Tour Qualifier, some Top 8 in an onlie PTQ.


**What deck did you play and why?**


I played Burn because I didn't have a lot of time to test other Modern decks.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I want one or two [Volcanic Fallout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout)s in my sideboard to use against Affinity and [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer).


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) and [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel).
