 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 







So the plan last weekend was to get up early on Saturday and draft all day long. Normally weekend drafts don't start until noon at the earliest but getting an early jump just meant more drafts could happen. I was looking forward to getting at least four eight-man drafts in with a table that included multiple players seriously preparing for Kuala Lumpur. It would be valuable research for this weekend's Pro Tour – at least that is what I told my wife. 


The confirmation e-mails circulated throughout the list to make sure that we would achieve the critical mass eight players. I had been sick in the days leading up to the weekend with a fever hovering around 100 and sent a message to the list saying I was going to have to pass. The reply from Josh Ravitz suggested a novel way to break the fever...


"Your fever is clearly gaming related... Don't know what kind of crack team of doctors you've got working for you but anyone could have told you that. It is the fever, after all."


I was tempted but as it turned out I was in the throes of pneumonia, and as of this writing have not even left the house in what is closing in on eight days. No drafting and no Pro Tour for me this time out...just movies, books, and a cycle of antibiotics. I am heading back to the doctor today and hopefully he will prescribe several cycles of *Lorwyn, Lorwyn, Morningtide* for this weekend.


Remember that you can follow all the coverage – it may even have started going up by the time this goes live – in the Tournament Center. It is the first time in nearly six years that I will be able to sit home and follow the coverage as a fan. I am looking forward to cheering on local Pro Tour winners Jon Finkel, Zvi Mowshowitz, Chris Lachman, and Jacob Van Lunen. I can barely wait for the chance to see some of the game's top players drafts put under the microscope of the Draft Viewer. In the meanwhile, here are some sights from Kuala Lumpur as seen through the lens of crack Pro Tour photog Craig Gibson.
