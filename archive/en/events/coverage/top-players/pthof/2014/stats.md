PRO TOUR HALL OF FAME 2014 CANDIDATE STATS
------------------------------------------


  
A breakdown of the candidates for induction in the 2014 *Magic* Pro Tour Hall of Fame.


  
**Key**  
**Median Finish:** Midpoint of career Pro Tour finishes (half above, half below)  
**Three-year Median:** Top median finish taken from three consecutive seasons (to qualify, must have played in a number of events in a three-year span equal to the total number of events minus three)  
**POY Top 10s:** Number of times a player finished in the Top 10 in a Player of the Year race.  
**Top Finishes:** These are cumulative counts by result finish (for example, a Top 8 finish is also counted as a Top 16, Top 32, and Top 64).
