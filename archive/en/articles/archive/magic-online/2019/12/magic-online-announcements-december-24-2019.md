*Vintage Cube* until January 16
-------------------------------


The *Vintage Cube* is back and will run until January 16! Tabletop Studio's (R&D) Reggie Valk has this to say about the latest update:


*"As December rolls on,* Magic Online *players know what's coming:* Vintage Cube*. If you're unfamiliar,* Vintage Cube *is one of the most powerful cubes you can play, headlined by the Power Nine and other members of the Vintage reserved list. While considering how to update the Cube for this year's December iteration, I decided that this update wasn't going to attempt any major overhauls, just include some of the most powerful cards to be printed this year. Fortunately, there were quite a few!* War of the Spark *brought powerful new planeswalkers that have made a splash even in Vintage, and* Modern Horizons *and* Throne of Eldraine *were no slouches either. Still, the core of the Cube experience remains the same: there's [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)-fueled artifact decks, Storm combo, and blistering fast mono-red aggro to name a few. Happy cubing! Here's hoping you all get to open a [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)!"*

Pioneering a New Ban Cadence
----------------------------


Per Ian's [overall B&R article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/december-16-2019-banned-and-restricted-announcement), Pioneer's ban timing will sync up with the rest of the Banned list following the next announcement on Monday, January 6. Any ban that day will take effect at noon Tuesday. Since we know that many Pioneer fans play on *Magic Online*, we wanted to make it clear how this will work with *Magic Online* league play.


If a card is banned, players using the newly banned card in a league can finish their league courses up until the ban takes effect. At noon PT on Tuesday, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned, players will be able to join the Pioneer league with decks containing those cards after the changes are made effective at noon PT on Tuesday.


For more information about Pioneer, check out [Blake's announcement article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-pioneer-format-2019-10-21).
