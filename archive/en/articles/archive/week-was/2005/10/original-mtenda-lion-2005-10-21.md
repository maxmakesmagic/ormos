*Wizards of the Coast is in the process of moving to a new building and will return with new articles beginning Monday, October 24th. In the meantime, we hope you'll enjoy this informal week of previously run content relating to* Mirage*, in preparation for that popular set's upcoming release on* **Magic** Online*. Have a great week, and we'll be back to see you on Monday.*

The original design for [Mtenda Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mtenda+Lion), a one-mana green creature from *Mirage*, was a little more, shall we say, aggressive.

Bagnali Lion was a 2/1 for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) that could not block blue creatures and did no damage to blue creatures that blocked it. Not a bad color-affiliated drawbackâ€¦ but what blue deck played creatures in that era?! Blue was all about control and countering, meaning the Lion's drawback didn't even affect it in the relevant match-up! Okay, so it was bad against Merfolk, but that hardly makes up for the fact that it is a hyper-efficient weenie in every other situation.

To fix it, R&D created a blue-based drawback that would actually come up when playing against blue decks, and shipped the "can't block" clause over to another green common in the set, [Gibbering Hyenas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gibbering+Hyenas).

The fix worked; [Mtenda Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mtenda+Lion) was hardly seen on the tournament scene.
