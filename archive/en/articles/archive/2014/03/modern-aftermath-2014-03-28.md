 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized playâ€™s content specialist in June 2014. 





At the end of four rounds of Modern, it is Melira Pod that stands above the rest of the field. Lars Dam swept through his opponents, emerging as the only undefeated player in Modern at the end of the day.


Following behind him are Tamas Glied, Bing Luke, and Paul Nemeth, each earning 3-1 in their Modern rounds. While Glied and Luke each brought Jund to these past four rounds, Nemeth was running a unique take on White-Blue-Red as an archetype, sporting a few copies of [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker) to set up a combo kill with [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel), differentiating it from the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) decks as it skips on all the combo pieces to enable the popular enchantment-based kill.


After these four players is the rest of the field, with Farand Lee being the unfortunate recipient of an 0-4 record at the end of the Modern rounds, his Turbo [Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) deck unable to muster a single match win throughout the day.


In the end, Melira Pod has once against shown its ability to overtake most strategies in an unknown field, securing Dam a solid record going into Day Two. Jund saw a resurgence in this event, and put up proper results for most of its pilots, the deck being a solid choice against the metagame that emerged.


We'll see if Dam is able to maintain his understanding of Constructed with tomorrow's Standard rounds, or whether someone else will surge to the top of the standings.
