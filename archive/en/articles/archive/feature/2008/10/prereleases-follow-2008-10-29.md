In June we announced a number of changes that would be made to our Prerelease system. Worldwide, the resulting *Shards of Alara* Prerelease was our largest event ever, but we know improvements are needed. We are now evaluating how the *Shards of Alara* Prereleases and Launch Parties were received and what potential adjustments, if feasible, can be made to make this an even better experience for our player community in the future. 

To complement the feedback we have already received through forums, organizers, and fan sites, we are offering you the opportunity to share your perspectives with us. Please use the link at the bottom of this announcement to take a brief survey (in English) and provide us your insights. Your feedback will help us make Prereleases the best possible experience for **Magic** players.

Due to past variations in Prereleases between countries with respect to location, event dates, and prize support, the impact of the changes made with *Shards of Alara* has been different from one country to another. Our ambition is for Prereleases to be global celebrations of each new set, offering all players convenient access and a great gaming experience wherever they choose to play.

For the upcoming set, [*Conflux*](/en/articles/archive/announcing-conflux-2008-07-30), which will be released in early February, details regarding the Prereleases and Launch Parties will be announced in January on **magicthegathering.com** and in an email to DCI members. In the meantime we will continue to take your feedback into account, and we look forward to bringing you even better Prerelease events with *Conflux*.
