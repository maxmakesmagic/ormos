As we [announced recently](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/203), the new **Magic Online** is in its limited time Sneak Peek! You can [download the new game client](http://www.wizards.com/magic/digital/magiconline.aspx?x=mtg/digital/magiconline/sneakpeek) until July 25, 2012, and check it out.


What’s your favorite new feature? What can be improved? What other features do you still want? **All** of your feedback is important, so after playing on the new version, please share your thoughts using this [brief survey](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/977005/Magic-Online-New-UI-Sneak-Peek-Survey) and help shape the future of **Magic Online**. You can also join the conversation in [the **Magic Online** forums](http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/view/75846/135046/Magic_Online_General) or by using the [#mtgo](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23mtgo) hashtag on Twitter.


The Sneak Peek will be available until the downtime on July 25, so check it out now and tell us what you think! Please remember that actions you perform during the Sneak Peek will affect your actual **Magic Online** accounts. The interface may be different, but the effects are still permanent as if you were using the current **Magic Online** client.
