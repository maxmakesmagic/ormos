The people have spoken and in a close race, artifact edged out white and black.



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Color** | **Votes** | **%** |
| Artifact | 2956 | 26.20% |
| Black | 2431 | 21.54% |
| White | 2394 | 21.22% |
| Blue | 1860 | 16.48% |
| Red | 1643 | 14.56% |
| **Total** | **11284** | **100.00%** |

  
The public has been clamoring for more artifacts, so here’s your chance to add one to the “Bacon” block. I think this will be an interesting lesson as designing artifacts is very tricky. You want to create a card with flavor, but not one that will usurp the flavor of any particular color. You want to create a card that’s powerful, but not one that will go in every deck.

You have you work cut out for you. On to our second question:

Do you want your card to be an **artifact creature** or an **non-creature artifact**?

The poll is up now and will end the following Sunday (February 23rd) at midnight.

If you’ve registered, vote [**here**](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=ymtc2_step2).

If you have not, register **here**.

I’m curious to see what you choose.
