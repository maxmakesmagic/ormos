The newest **Magic** set, *Conspiracy*, introduces a lot of awesome new cards into our favorite game. It also has some of my favorite playtest names ever.


Let's take a quick quiz and see which card had which playtest name. This isn't a quiz that you will know the answer, this is just a guess and see if you are right. So don't feel bad if you miss a few!
