Surrounded by mountains, the sea and the countryside, Kobe is blessed with an abundance of beautiful natural surroundings. It is a city with wide ranging appeal, where vibrant city life goes hand in hand with history and culture in the form of such attractions as hot springs and sake breweries. The Pro tour visits Kobe on October 20-22.


Pro Tour-Kobe is a *Time Spiral* Booster Draft format event with a last-chance qualifier run the day before the event starts. But you don't have to be a Pro to enjoy the Pro Tour -- there will be wall-to-wall **Magic** to play in Side Events all weekend with amazing prizes.


### See the World!


**TRAVEL GUIDE:** Includes instructions on getting from the airport to the event hall, information on Kobe's attractions and sight-seeing, Japanese customs, and just about anything else you need to know when visiting Japan.
