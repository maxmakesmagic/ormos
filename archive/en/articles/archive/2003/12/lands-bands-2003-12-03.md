So, maybe the cycle of *Legends* lands that grant banding abilities to certain-colored legends aren't exactly the most powerful cards in the game. They're even "hosed" by another banding-related land from that same set -- [Tolaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria) -- just in case!


But they are highly flavorful, and they have cool art. Check out some great old-school fantasy art from some unappreciated banding-era cards. Wouldn't your [Adun Oakenshield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adun+Oakenshield) feel right at home in one of these places, banding with his buddies [Hunding Gjornersen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunding+Gjornersen) and [Ramirez DePietro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramirez+DePietro)?
