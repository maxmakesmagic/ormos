The Modern Super League action really heats up tonight, with four elimination matches that will whittle the field in half before next week’s finale.

Luis Scott-Vargas brought a sweet Jeskai Ascendancy list to play for MSL, but he lost last week to Willy Edel's Abzan list despite successfully transforming into a [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven)/[Unburial Rites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) deck and getting a [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) into play in Game 2. Luis doesn’t sound super happy about his deck choice in a field that includes three Black-Green-X decks, but he still seems very capable of rattling off a couple of wins tonight to stay alive in the league. Next up for Luis is reigning Player of the Year Mike Sigrist and his White-Black Tokens deck:

One place where innovation was rewarded last week was in Patrick Dickmann’s list. The innovator of both Tempo Twin and Tarmo Twin is at it again, this time adding Bounding Krasis to his Tarmo Twin list in place of the [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite)s. Last week his ability to flash out 3/3s and attack with them applied enough pressure for him to win a pair of close games, and as a result he’s already through to the winner’s bracket finals (and won’t have to stay up until 3 a.m. this week, as he has earned a week off).


Lee Shi Tian has made the Top 8 in three of the four Modern Pro Tours that have ever been held, but he’s going to have to get through both Reid Duke and then Willy Edel if he wants to stay alive in Modern Super League. His Elves list looks quite fun, but it didn’t really get to do its thing last week against Shaun McLaren, who proved that he is capable of winning with colors other than blue, white, and red.

You can see everyone’s decklists [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/modern-super-league-decklists-2015-09-15). Tonight they will be using the same decks as last week.


The one match that isn’t an elimination match is the one between Shaun and Cedric Phillips. Cedric won last week with a Zoo deck that he attributes directly to long-time red mage Patrick Sullivan. If the StarCityGames.com editor can beat up on one of his writers tonight, he earns a spot in the winner’s bracket final against Patrick Dickmann. The loser, however, will fall into the final elimination match of the night against either Luis or Siggy.


See you tonight at 6 p.m. Pacific Time on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) for five more awesome matches of *Magic*! For more information about *Magic Online*, please visit [mtgo.com/signup](http://mtgo.com/signup).
