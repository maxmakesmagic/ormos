Blackwell started out with a good hand: Ramosian Sergeant, Renounce, Charm Peddler, Thermal Glider, a Plains, and 2 Mountains. Blackwell kept and drew Lithophage on his first turn. He played his small creatures and searched for Nightwind Glider by "going up the chain": he searched for Ramosian Lieutenant with Ramosian Sergeant and used the Ramosian Lieutenant to get the Glider. Blackwell remained aggressive for the rest of the game, using Kris Mage to keep Burgner's Creatures out of the way.

After game one, Blackwell sided out a Gerrard's Irregulars and sided in a Cavern Crawler and a Ceremonial Guard. Game one went very similar to the first as Blackwell took the early advantage with his fliers. Burgner drew his Notorious Assassin but couldn't stop the quick flyers of Blackwell's before it was removed.


**Kurt Burgner 0 - Trevor Blackwell 2** 


This game started out much better for Burgner as he lay early creatures of his own backed up by Spidersilk Armor. Blackwell had the answer for Spidersilk Armor but could still have lost the race if he hadn't drawn more offense. The key play of the game was when Burgner attacked with a Deepwood Ghoul and Blackwell blocked with Charm Peddler. Burgner let combat damage go on the stack, then used a Maggot Therapy to kill the Charm Peddler. Burgner should have killed it before damage so it would not have caused the Deepwood Ghoul to need to be regenerated, at a cost of two life. Those two life points put Burgner in a position where he had to topdeck a Highway Robber to win the game.
