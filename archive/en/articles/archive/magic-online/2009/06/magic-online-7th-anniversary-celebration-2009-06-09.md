### *Mirage* and *Tempest* Return

As part of the MTGO 7th Anniversary Celebration *Mirage* and *Tempest* block product (including discounted tournament packs – see below) will return to the MTGO store for two weeks each. 

*Mirage* block products will be available from June 17th until the July 1st downtime while *Tempest* block products will be available from July 1st until the July 15th downtime. This is a great opportunity to complete your collection!

### Farewell to Tournament Packs

**Magic Online** is saying farewell to tournament packs. As a final opportunity to play with tournament packs, we will be offering discounted prices on tournament packs and four different Nix Tix Sealed Deck Showdowns!

*Mirage*, *Tempest*, *Lorwyn*, and *Shadowmoor* block tournament packs will be available in the **Magic Online** store for the discounted price of $9.99 US! These discounts will last from the start of the anniversary celebration through the end of each block's special week (see master schedule below). At the end of each block's special week, that block's tournament packs will be discontinued from the **Magic Online** store. 

During the MTGO 7th Anniversary Celebration, each of the blocks listed above will have its own week of Nix Tix Sealed Daily Events and Nix Tix Swiss Queues in which tournament packs from that block will be used for the last time. These events can qualify players for a scheduled End of Tournament Packs Nix Tix Sealed Showdown as well.

### Launch of Casual Format Weekend Challenges

In addition to official format discounts, we are introducing a new series of weekly events to support all of our casual constructed formats – Weekend Challenges. These constructed events offer you the opportunity to compete in your favorite casual format in a large event setting every week. 

One Weekend Challenge will be offered for each and every casual format (Kaleidoscope, 100-Card Singleton, Pauper, and Standard w/Vanguard) each weekend. Each format's Weekend Challenge start time will rotate from week-to-week to accommodate players with different schedules.

In addition, each month's Weekend Challenge events will award an exclusive promo card in addition to its other prizes. This promo card will focus on one of the casual formats though it will be playable in many places. Everyone who participates in these events will receive that month's promo card and the top 8 finishers will receive a foil version of the promo card as well. For the last two weekends of June, these events will award the Kaleidoscope focused full art Electrolyze promo card. 

These events will replace of the Weekend Premier Events beginning June 20th. See the [Weekly MTGO Schedule](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/digital/Article.aspx?x=magic/magiconline/eventsmain) for exact times.
