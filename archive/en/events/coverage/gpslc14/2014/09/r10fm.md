 Mike Cannon started writing From the Lab at the end of 2012 after two years with GatheringMagic. He is an ardent casual player and loves finding uses for bad cards. 





Nathan Holiday is mostly known as a constructed player. First rising to prominence after winning Grand Prix San Diego in 2013, he has since added top 8 performances in Phoenix and Minneapolis. However, a 10th place finish at Grand Prix Atlanta proved that Holiday can handle himself in limited as well, and going undefeated on day 1 gave him a strong starting position going into round 10.



 Allen Sun is still new to the Grand Prix scene, having played in only one event before GP Salt Lake City. Most of his experience comes from *Magic Online*, and Sun said he has had some difficulty adapting to certain aspects of paper *Magic*.




 Sun played black-red on day 1, one of the least popular color combinations in *Magic 2015* limited. However, he managed to break the mold by not losing a single match in sealed, and when it came time to draft he once again chose to go with black-red.




 Holiday went with a more conventional strategy in draft, building a green-white deck with several copies of [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) to provide the mana to cast his more powerful cards ahead of schedule. A suite of cheap creatures could allow him to go on the offensive early or buy time until the larger threats took over.




**Game One**




 Holiday started off with an impressive amount of mana acceleration, casting [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic)s on each of the first three turns. Unfortunately Holiday was lacking a big play to follow them up with, and the Elves ended up doing more attacking than anything else. Fortunately Holiday had a [Sunblade Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunblade+Elf) to make the 1/1s more effective in combat.
