![Shattered Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shattered+Dreams)**[Shattered Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattered+Dreams)**, the *Fifth Dawn* sorcery that lets you "[Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)" an artifact from your opponent's hand, is named appropriately. It's like a [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) (artifact removal) that affects the artifact in question while it's still in your opponent's mind (his or her hand).

As seen below, the art of [Shattered Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattered+Dreams) depicts green-aligned hero **[Glissa Sunseeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa+Sunseeker)** traveling through the Mephidross Swamp, and getting hit with mind magic that causes her to drop her sword. And the sword she's carrying is the legendary **[Sword of Kaldra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Kaldra)**.
