 What makes a World Championship special? What's happened in the twenty years it has been an event? It's far beyond the scope of any one article to cover it all, but if there's one expert that can pull some of the best bits together, it's *Magic*'s Lead Designer Mark Rosewater. Throughout the run of World Championship events for *Magic*, Rosewater has personally attended all but one of them.




 He's also someone that understands the fundamental nature that make *Magic* so great.




 "One of the things we discovered is that there are different prizes someone can win, and one that's popular are titles. One that's really potent and powerful is 'World Champion.' We wanted to make sure there was a World Champion every year. The current World Championship is a little different from those in years past, but it's still the best players playing for it. It's older than the Pro Tour, and it plays a big role in the story of *Magic*'s past, demonstrating how worldwide the game is. We started with just four countries and now you can see it's seventy-two countries."



So what is the history of the World Championship? As one of its most ardent fans, Rosewater had an oral history at the ready.




**Magic* Lead Designer Mark Rosewater has been to all but one *Magic* World Championship. His tenure in the game makes him a valuable source of historical recollection.*
