From the sixth color, the team goes on to discuss other topics. They talk about alternate win conditions. You take the opportunity to bring up poison. You make a passionate speech about how the public loves poison. They would be beside themselves if we dedicated a block to it. The response: “Mark, enough with the poison.”


The team then discusses a variety of different topics. Two hours blow by before you know it. It’s time for lunch!
