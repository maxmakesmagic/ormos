**Sam Black (Jeskai) - Matt Severa (RG) - Gaudenis Vidugiris (Sultai) vs.
 Fujimura Kazuaki (Temur Trail) - Kakumae Teruya (Jeskai) - Tamada Ryoichi (Mardu/Abzan)**



 Likely needing a draw to advance to the single-elimination rounds, "Team Madison" found themselves back in the feature area, facing off against an Osaka, Japan team.  Both teams feature strong lineups; all six competitors have found themselves in the single-elimination rounds of professional events before.  In the A seat, No. 22 Sam Black's Jeskai deck would trade tricks with GP Shizuoka quarterfinalist Fujimura Kazuaki's Temur-flavored [Trail of Mystery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trail+of+Mystery) deck; the B seat would see an aggressive RG deck in the hands of GP Detroit (2003!) quarterfinalist Matt Severa running into GP Kobe winner Kakumae Teruya's Jeskai deck; and on the end, triple Grand-Prix winner Gaudenis Vidugiris and GP Shanghai semifinalist Tamada Ryoichi were lined up in a control mirror—with Sultai on Vidugiris's side of the table, and a four-color Mardu-Abzan hybrid for Ryoichi.
