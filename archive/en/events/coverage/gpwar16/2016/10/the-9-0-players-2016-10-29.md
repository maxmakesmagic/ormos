1,113 players showed up to battle in beautiful Warsaw, Poland. After nine rounds of standard only four of them sport an undefeated 9-0 record, and it's an exciting mix of a seasoned veteran, an up and coming Ukrainian, and a flatmate of the winner of last Grand Prix Warsaw. Without further ado, these are the 9-0 players after Day One:  
  

For 26-year-old Jérémy Dezani it's certainly not his first 9-0 rodeo. Warsaw marks his fourth undefeated record at a Grand Prix, and he has only missed making top 8 once when doing so. His deck might look like a regular Mardu Vehicles deck, but he has changed it just enough to have good match-ups against the other top decks and plays fewer actual Vehicles than the regular version. He wanted to thanks someone special for supporting him during the day.


"Raphaël Levy! I've been using his Pro Player card for tokens all day," said Dezani.

Sam Rolph might not be a known face on the Pro Tour nor the Grand Prix scene, but the 19-year old Englishman is sharing an apartment with some other of Britain's best *Magic* players. His deck this weekend, Green-Black delirium took him to a 9-0 start after an exciting match in the last round against Wojciech Grabowski.


"He kept ticking up his [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance), which I was hoping for since my only way to win the game was to play [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End), and on his turn ultimate Chandra and cast enough spells to kill him with it's ability, and I could deal exactly 20," said Sam Rolph.


He was also extra happy to be 9-0 after posting an 8-0-1 record at Grand Prix London a few weeks ago, nearly missing the prestigious pristine Day One record.

Bart van Etten took a Mardu Vehicles deck to the sweet 9-0 record, his second in his career. He also has a Grand Prix Top 8 from Brussels 2015 to his name, and is hoping for a repeat this weekend. The secret to his success?  

"[Skysovereign, Consul Flagship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skysovereign%2C+Consul+Flagship), it's insane. It's really good against White-Blue and it crushes the mirror match," he said, before congratulating countryman Thomas Hendriks on also going undefeated, although with a not as sweet 6-0-3 record.

The last of the undefeated is all smiles Ukrainian Oleksii Riabokon, who took an aggressive approach of Green-Black delirium to the tournament. With both [Servant of the Conduit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+the+Conduit) and [Verdurous Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdurous+Gearhulk), the 28-year old could quickly dispatch his opponents.


"Gearhulk is the best card in the deck, it's just too strong. [Servant of the Conduit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+the+Conduit) is not that great in the late game, but it enables turn four [Verdurous Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdurous+Gearhulk)," he explained his way to victory.
