Armed with his perpetual smile and wackier-than-usual deck, "The" Ben Seck is ready to take down the Masters Gateway. The two-time Grand Prix Champion is playing a crazy red-white cycling deck, like [Astral Slide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide) but supercharged by [Fluctuator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator). The presence of maindeck Disciples of Law helps to give red decks fits. That's bad news for Gary "MF" Talim, who recently Top 8'd at Grand Prix – Singapore. The big man is with Sligh, like so many others trying to speed their way to two grand.

### Game 1

![Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lightning+Rift)Talim won the die roll and kicked off with a [Goblin Cadets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Cadets). Seck went one better with [Mox Diamond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond) and [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift). Talim's draw was substandard, and he had to send a [Volcanic Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer) to the dome. Seck trumped him with [Fluctuator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator). Suddenly he had lots of cantrip [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)s at his disposal.Talim failed to find a third land, playing out a pair of [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll)s and some Seals of [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire). Seck had ample time. He Tutored for [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift), then drew another. That was more than enough versus Talim's two land. He machinegunned him out.

Seck 1 – Talim 0

### Game 2

Seck pulled [Clear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clear) and [Radiant's *Judgment*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant%27s+Judgment)s for Angels and a [Radiant's Dragoons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant%27s+Dragoons). Talim pulled some burn to bring in land destruction and [Fledgling Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fledgling+Dragon)s. 

Talim's draw had a little more gas this time around. He kicked off with Mire and Pup, then a mountain, Pup and Cadets. Seck had to play a [Secluded Steppe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secluded+Steppe), readying a [Slice and Dice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+and+Dice), but Talim came down with [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) to keep Seck off his critical third mana. Seck gamely played a [Fluctuator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator), and Talim showed him the [Blistering Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat) to take the game. It was the very picture of a nuts Sligh draw.

Seck 1 – Talim 1

### Game 3

Seck paused on his second turn in the deciding game, staring down a Fanatic. He decided to drop a [Fluctuator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator) before passing it back. Talim again had the port, keeping Seck off his Red mana. Seck did not have a second red source, and was forced to play a [Drifting Meadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drifting+Meadow), clearly short on lands. Talim further slowed him down with a [Pillage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage) on the [Fluctuator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator).

Seck again failed to find land, and Talim punished him. [Pillage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage) and [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) reduced him to just a [Blasted Landscape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasted+Landscape). He did not draw another land. [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain) left him permanentless. Only then did Talim start bringing out the men. With the Port keeping Seck on the back foot, Talim cruised to victory.

**Final Result:** Gary Talim defeats Ben Seck 2-1
