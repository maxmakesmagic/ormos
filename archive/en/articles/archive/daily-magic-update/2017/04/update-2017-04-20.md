The April 20, 2017 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 20, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by going into a [cool, iconic Prerelease blind](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/hascon-and-kickoff-our-25th-anniversary-2017-04-20).


Today's Musts
=============


1. [*Amonkhet* First Look: What We Learned at the Pre-Prerelease](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13914&writer=Adam+Styborski&articledate=4-20-2017) | TCGPlayer | Adam Styborski

This is one of the most thorough "prepare for the Prerelease" articles I've ever read. We've got lessons from the Pre-Prerelease, lessons from Steve Rubin on the mechanics and themes, a spreadsheet listing all of the combat tricks, and tips and tricks for building your first Sealed deck. It's got it all, basically. So I guess we're done here. Everyone go home.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Netdecks and Chill](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34957_Netdecks-And-Chill.html) | StarCityGames.com | Emma Handy

This article packs more decks than basically any I've seen before—and all for *Amonkhet* Standard. There are Humans decks and tokens decks and [Winding Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor) decks and like eight different kinds of aggressive red-white decks.


1. I hope you like Travis Sowers!

Because if you do, then there is a ton of him talking about *Amonkhet* on the internet today. The shorter piece is the [latest episode from the Men from MODO](http://manadeprived.com/men-modo-23-walk-like-egyptian/), in which he and David Savill review *Amonkhet* for a mere 2 hours. But wait! There's more . . . Travis Sowers! He joined Neal Oliver on stream yesterday to review *Amonkhet* for a total of a bit over 6 hours. You can check out the bulk of the stream [in this video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/136689088), but the [reviewing mostly started here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/136664194).


1. [Full Art of Vizier of the Menagerie](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/005/609/511/large/victor-adame-vizier-of-the-menagerie.jpg) | Victor Adame

The full-art releases continue with Victor Adame releasing the large version of his gorgeous [Vizier of the Menagerie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+the+Menagerie).


1. [Commander Review: *Amonkhet* Part 2 (Red, Green, Colorless, Multicolor, Lands)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/commander-review-amonkhet-part-2-red-green-colorless-multi-color-lands?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | Tomer Abramovici

We talked about [Part 1](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/commander-review-amonkhet-part-1-mechanics-white-blue-black?src=wizards) yesterday, so you already know what's going on here. Yes, I'm assuming you never miss a single Daily Update. Because why would you hurt my feelings like that?


1. [Puppers, Poison, and Presentations. A Conversation with VorthosMike](https://eyesonthemise.podbean.com/e/episode-58-puppers-poison-and-presentations-a-conversation-with-vorthosmike/) | Eyes on the Mise | Ian Dixon and John Wells

As you might have heard, or as [Mike Linnemann might have tweeted at you](https://twitter.com/VorthosMike/status/855068842254643201), the *Magic* Art Show is totally happening at Las Vegas. But before that, Linnemann joined Dixon and Wells on Eyes on the Mise to talk about the art show—and dogs. Because they're adorable.


*Magic* Player Profile Survey
=============================


1. [Want to influence how we make *Magic*?](https://www.research.net/r/mtg-motivations)

What do you want as a *Magic* fan? How can we better serve what you're looking for as a gamer? You can let us know directly with [this new survey](https://www.research.net/r/mtg-motivations) we've put out that's currently active and waiting for your feedback.


Although we're already well aware of [your feelings on Sensei's Divining Top](http://imgur.com/NvLcIoL), so you can leave that part out.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> [@misterorange](https://twitter.com/misterorange) I love the idea, I remember going to Prerelease's way back and that being the first time seeing the cards. It was awesome [@blakepr](https://twitter.com/blakepr)

That's the idea! For our 25th anniversary we're going to be doing a lot of looking backward and looking forward. The idea of reliving that old-school world of going into a Prerelease blind was one of my favorite ideas, and it was cool to incorporate it into HASCON. (Not sure what this is about? [Check out this article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/hascon-and-kickoff-our-25th-anniversary-2017-04-20).)


1. > 
> [#MTGHOU](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGHOU?src=hash) set symbol is Bolas horns. Who would have guessed? :p [pic.twitter.com/YrDIEdm346](https://t.co/YrDIEdm346)

Hmm, what could this cryptic symbol mean? What could it mean?!


Deck of the Day
===============


1. New Horizons

I've seen a few variations on this deck, but the coolest deck I've seen so far to come out of *Amonkhet* looks to win in one exciting turn where it cycles through possibly its entire deck. It centers around these cards:


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=New+Perspectives)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=New+Perspectives) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shadow+of+the+Grave)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+of+the+Grave) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Weirding+Wood)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weirding+Wood)
[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vizier+of+Tumbling+Sands)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+Tumbling+Sands) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shefet+Monitor)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shefet+Monitor)
The idea is that if you can get to seven cards in hand and a [New Perspectives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=New+Perspectives) in play, you can cycle through your entire deck, or at least much of it. From there, [Vizier of Tumbling Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+Tumbling+Sands) and [Shefet Monitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shefet+Monitor) can provide you with some extra mana, [Weirding Wood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weirding+Wood) can make Vizier even more potent, and [Shadow of the Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+of+the+Grave) can let you refill once you've run out of cycling cards.


From there, it's basically your choice how you want to win. Do you want to [Drake Haven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drake+Haven)? Go for it. How about [Approach of the Second Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun)? Risky, but it's also a single-card win condition.


The fun part is that the deck actually has some play to it. [Shefet Monitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shefet+Monitor) can grab Deserts, which means it can grab a [Sunscorched Desert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscorched+Desert) at instant speed to break up the CopyCat combo. Against aggressive decks, [Renewed Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith) and [Haze of Pollen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haze+of+Pollen) can keep you alive until you win on turn five or six. And the bevy of cyclers means finding [New Perspectives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=New+Perspectives) isn't that hard.


The deck is a bit of a glass cannon, but man is it fun.


Below you'll find Frank Karsten's decklist from [his article on ChannelFireball yesterday](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/3-combo-brews-with-amonkhet/), but I would also check out [the list on Reddit by Tyler Hill](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/66b62k/standard_how_to_lose_friends_and_irritate_people/).
