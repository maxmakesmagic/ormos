Heart in a Cage

Welcome, scattering Mirrans and glorified Phyrexians, to the first preview week for *New Phyrexia*! I can't really express how excited I've been, waiting with bated impatience, to dive off the deep end into glistening oil. From the innocuous months ago during *Scars of Mirrodin* to my current compleation, I've been fighting the dark fight for a new Phyrexia.

Which is exactly what we got.
