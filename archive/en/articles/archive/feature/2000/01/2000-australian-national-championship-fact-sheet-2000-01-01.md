These must be received by the 31st May 2000.


**I hear that there is going to be a BBQ for all nationals’ players, how do I get involved in that?**


Entry for invited players is free. If you wish to come along and enjoy the BBQ anyway, we are asking for $15 for a BBQ lunch. This is going to be held at the


Rydges Canberra (the same venue as the AU National Championships) starting at around 12:30pm. Signage will be up around the hotel, so you shouldn’t have any problems finding us. If you have any problems, you can contact Chris Zantides on 0412 511 909.

Make sure you let the hotel know when you make your reservation that you are with the Wizards of the Coast Australia National Championships and you would like to book at that rate.


**What is public transport to the area like?**


Rydges Lakeside is centrally located, on London Circuit near Lake Burley Griffin. It is about a ten-minute walk from the interstate bus terminal at the Jolimont Centre on Northbourne Avenue. From the airport or the Kingston train terminal, you should take a taxi (about $10). For food and entertainment outside the Rydges complex, you can take a short walk into Civic. If you want to go further afield, the more up market suburb of Manuka is about a $10 taxi ride away.


**Why aren’t we using the "Attendance-Based System" from the 1999 AU Nationals?**


We are trying to standardize, worldwide, how regional qualifying tournaments feed a closed National Championship. Eight-slots per region has been the standard (with some less populous but necessary regions having 2-slots).


**Can you give me a timetable of the AU Nationals?**

**Is the Upcoming Expansion Prophecy really included in the National Draft?**


Yes. Prophecy becomes legal for limited play on the day of its release. This is about a week before Nationals, therefore all limited events that can use it, are going to. This means Nationals.


**What is the story with the meat grinders?**


This year we have decided to run four meat-grinder tournaments at AU National Championships. This year, for the first time, we are offering both Sealed and Constructed grinders.


These events are run SINGLE-elimination.


Entry fee for Sealed is $20 and for constructed (standard) $10. All of the grinders carry 4 invitations to the AU National Championships


**How will the draw work at the AU National Championships?**


It will be 12 rounds of continued Swiss-style pairings. You may play the same person up to three times (once during draft 1, during draft 2 and during the standard day). If you make the DOUBLE Elimination finals, it is possible for you to play that same person once again.


**I know that we have an early start on the Sunday and Monday. What can I do about breakfast?**


We have organized to have breakfast start a little early; it will begin at 6:30am on both days. If you aren’t staying at the Rydges, but want to enjoy the delicious buffet breakfast on offer, we have organized a $15 deal (a 25% discount off the normal price).


**What is this I hear about competitor t-shirts?**


All persons who have been invited to AU National Championships, and actually attend will receive, free, a competitor shirt. Limited quantities of XXXL will be available, if you need a XXXL please get there early to avoid being disappointed.
