Welcome to Ally Week! This week we're going to be exploring the most linear of *Zendikar*'s mechanics. I'll walk you through their creation while interweaving the explanation of design's need for linear mechanics. I might even go into a little more detail into the origin of the ally mechanic.

Allies My Mother Told Me
Before I jump into the story, I guess you probably want to read the Ally section of my [second *Zendikar* preview article](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/56) if you haven't already. (It's under a section called "Chaps"—the article explains why.) That article explains the basic story of Allies' design, but because I was trying to talk about so many different things in one article, it was an abridged story. Today you get the unabridged version.

So, the Allies' story begins in two different places. The first part happens even before we realized that our setting was going to be an adventure world. The design team (Doug Beyer, Graeme Hopkins, Ken Nagle, Matt Place and myself) were still fiddling around with land mechanics, and we had recently added in kicker. Traps, quests, adventurer's Equipment—all that was off in the future. Matt came to me with an idea. It was becoming clear that the land mechanics were going to be more modular designs, and that the set didn't have a linear design yet.
