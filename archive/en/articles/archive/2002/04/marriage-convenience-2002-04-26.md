Instant  

Remove target non-white attacking creature from the game. Gain life equal to that creature’s toughness.


Marriage of Convenience was slated to be a removal spell in *Alliances*; the thematic gist was that the targeted creature was removed from the game because it "got married," similar to how a creature vanquished by [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) was said to have "gone farming."


The art came back from Phil Foglio and can be seen on the right.


Once the whole thing was put together, the card was quite silly. Too silly, it was decided, for what was supposed to be a tier-one tournament card. Silliness certainly has a place in Magic, but high-quality removal spells are not really the best place for such antics.


So the team starting moving art around, and after several swaps, the Rob Alexander piece on the left ended up on Marriage of Convenience. The problem was that it had nothing to do with marriage.


Much brainstorming ensued, and eventually someone came up with the clean and clever solution of calling the card "[Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exile)." The castle, he reasoned, was the place the target was exiled to.


  
The Foglio art ended up on an enchantment called [Unlikely Alliance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlikely+Alliance).
