Alexander Hayne has gone through quite a transformation over the past year. Before Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored*, he was a rookie best known for a second-place finish at Grand Prix Montreal 2011, where he was knocked out in the finals against seasoned veteran Rich Hoaen.


But then, a miracle happened. Actually, make that a few.


Hayne came equipped with a White-Blue Miracles deck at Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored*, a deck that was tested and tweaked extensively by a group of Canadian pro players. And in his first Pro Tour Top 8, Hayne blew away opponent after opponent with a series of powerful miracles like [Terminus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) and [Entreat the Angels](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels). A chorus of angels sang the rookie's praise in Hayne's final match, and the roar of Canadians he traveled with followed shortly after, as Hayne locked up a victory at his first Pro Tour along with a seat in the World **Magic** Cup and Players Championship.
