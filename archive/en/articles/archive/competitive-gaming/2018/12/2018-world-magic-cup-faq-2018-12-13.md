74 countries, $250,000, and three days of live action are what's in store for you December 14–16 with the 2018 World *Magic* Cup!


WORLD *MAGIC* CUP OVERVIEW
==========================


Here's the key info about the 2018 World *Magic* Cup:


* The World *Magic* Cup is a three-day, invitation-only event featuring 74 countries represented by three players each: the 2017–18 Pro Point leader of each country, and then the two finalists from each country's 2018 National Championship. Teams of three will compete for their share of a $250,000 prize pool.
* This year features the addition of Honduras to the field, bringing the field up to 74 teams in total.
* The format for the first three rounds of this tournament is *Guilds of Ravnica* Team Sealed, where teams will build the best 40-card decks they can from twelve boosters of *Guilds of Ravnica* per team. This will be the format for the first three rounds on Friday, but the remaining rounds of the World *Magi*c Cup will be Team Unified Standard Constructed.
* In Team Unified Standard, with the exception of basic lands, no two decks a team brings to the table can feature the same card. That means once one player puts a card like Lightning Strike in their deck, the other two decks that the team uses cannot include that card. Players will have to find the best combination of Standard decks to outwit whatever three-deck configurations the other teams will bring to the table.
* Day One consists of seven rounds divided into two stages: the first features three rounds of *Guilds of Ravnica* Team Sealed, and the second is four rounds of Team Unified Standard. Teams will play until they get four match wins before Round 7, at which point they will get byes for the remainder of the day and won't have to play again until Day Two. Any teams that have not reached four wins by Round 7 will play out the last round of the day.
* At the end of Day One, eight pools of four teams will be formed, with all teams that advanced into Day Two by getting four wins before Round 7, along with teams remaining after Round 7, until the Top 32 teams—based on standings—fill out the eight pools.
* Day Two consists of two stages of pool play, in which the four teams in each of the eight pools only play other teams within their pool. In the first stage, teams will compete in a modified double-elimination tournament structure for three rounds. Once a team wins two matches, they're through to the second stage of Day Two. Once a team loses two matches in this stage, they're out of the tournament.
* The remaining teams will be split into four pools of four for the second stage of Day Two, where they will again compete in a modified double-elimination tournament structure for three rounds. Teams that get two wins during this stage of the tournament advance to the Top 8 on Sunday.
* The Top 8 will play out in traditional single-elimination style until there is only one team remaining.
* Top 8 teams get invitations and airfare to compete in an upcoming tabletop Mythic Championship in 2019. The $250,000 prize pool pays down to the Top 32 finishing teams, with first place getting $45,000 divided equally among the three team members of the winning country.

The World *Magic* Cup is a unique event compared to other major *Magic* offerings, featuring a different tournament structure and competitive *Magic* regulars as well as aspiring competitors playing alongside each other to ensure their country emerges victorious.
