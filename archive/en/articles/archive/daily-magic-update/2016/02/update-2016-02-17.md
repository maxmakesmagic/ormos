The February 17, 2016 Update
============================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 17, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by slow news days. Whatever those are.


Today's Must
============


1. [MTG Discussion: Card Leaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeG6KcBNl30) | Seibenlore

Seibenlore takes a break from talking about lore to discuss leaks, and asks the obvious question: are they good or bad? (Hint: As the person in charge of the preview plan for each set, I vote bad. I actually do not like having hours and weeks of planning go down the drain. But I'm biased.) Seibenlore has an opinion, so I'll let him share it with you in his deep, lovely voice.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/KeG6KcBNl30>


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Commander VS: More Random Commander Goodness!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32412_Commander-VS-More-Random-Commander-Goodness.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

You can probably skip to the 2:20 mark if you don't care about football (though, if you do, the Sam Bradford sack clip is pretty great), but Justin, Stephen, Jonathan Suarez, and Wes Wise are back for another round of random Commander! The Commander action is already fun, but adding the randomness takes it to another level. That level clocks in at an hour, so make sure to clear your schedule if you're going to watch this one—it's worth it, but it's going to eat up your entire workout, evening, or lunch break.


1. [A Full Inventory](http://www.cardconfidants.com/a-full-inventory/)| CardConfidants | Emma Handy

Emma Handy steps into the *Magic* tradition of taking a "fearless magical inventory"—taking honest stock of your strengths and weaknesses as a player. It's something [Sam Stoddard started](http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/misc/15107_Feature_Article_Creating_a_Fearless_Magical_Inventory.html) long ago, and it's become the exercise to use if you want to be a better player—and sometimes even a better person. Emma's example is a strong one, so if you're looking for a good illustration of how to take stock and improve, definitely check out her article.


1. [Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* Tournament Report](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/pro-tour-oath-of-the-gatewatch-tournament-report/) | ChannelFireball | William Jensen

With [three Modern Grand Prix coming up](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premier-calendar#/overview), Modern is still as relevant as ever, and there are very few people you'd be better off learning from than Hall of Fame Pro extraordinaire William Jensen. How did he rise to very *nearly* snagging yet another Top 8 with Infect? How did he react to finishing in 9th place, the loneliest place? If you care anything for Infect, read on.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Magic Mics](http://www.twitch.tv/magicmics) | The Magic Show | Evan Erwin, Erin Campbell, and Rueben Bresler

Join the Magic Mics (Not Mikes. Sheesh. Who would make that mistake?) crew tonight at 11 p.m . (EST I'm assuming, though [this tweet](https://twitter.com/misterorange/status/699796232697475073) was unclear) to experience a live *Magic* talk show. Although, it's been [a pretty slow week](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-eternal-masters-2016-02-15), so [I can't imagine what](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/statement-about-eternal-masters-card-list-2016-02-16) they'll talk about.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. Britney Spears posts *Magic* art


> 
> Haha, guys, [@britneyspears](https://twitter.com/britneyspears) just shared one of my paintings. [pic.twitter.com/ufpg72RkLT](https://t.co/ufpg72RkLT)
> 
> 
> — Noah Bradley (@noahbradley) [February 17, 2016](https://twitter.com/noahbradley/status/699761642565832704)


I mean, Britney Spears *does* have kids who are about the right age...


At any rate, [Noah Bradley caught wind](https://twitter.com/noahbradley/status/699761642565832704) his art was being used by the songstress, and he wasn't even a little mad. It clearly didn't drive him crazy. Sometimes artists don't like being uncredited, but I think he'd even be okay with her posting something one more time.


Umm, something something, oops, I did it again.


1. [Charlotte, the most adorable Planeswalker](http://wizardsmagic.tumblr.com/post/139443245031/iphotographlove-charlotte-opens-her-package)

You want the antidote for yesterday's toxic (sorry) whirlwind of conversation and accusations? Adorable Tumblr posts! Today's is brought to you by Charlotte, would could not be more excited to receive *Magic* cards. And her excitement lasted long after the video, or at least long enough for [her parents to take these pictures](http://wizardsmagic.tumblr.com/post/139443267451/iphotographlove-charlotte-and-all-her-swag-that) as well.


Thanks, Charlotte, and Tumblr, for being adorable.


Top 25
======


1. Literal nothing changes

Owen Turtenwald is still, like, a bajillion points ahead of everyone. In actual math terms? The gap between Owen and No. 2 Seth Manfield is now the same as the gap between Seth and No. 9 Ivan Floch, or the same as the gap between Floch and No. 25 Luis Scott-Vargas. Basically, you could fit half the Top 25 inside Owen's lead.


At any rate, no change from last week. Moving on.

Community Spotlight
===================


1. [The Planeswalker Guide](http://planeswalkerguide.com/)

Still not enough podcasts in your life? How about giving The Planeswalker Guide a try? Most episodes have a special guest from the *Magic* community—a Professor here, an A.E. Marling there, an Erin Campbell or a Shaun Penrod over there—to talk about, well, most anything. Topics range from cosplay to Limited to, most recently, parenting as a *Magic* player. In fact, we'll make this a two-for community spotlight, as, in the latest Planeswalker Guide we meet Andrew Rudiger. Andrew is starting a new podcast called [Magic: The Parenting](https://twitter.com/MTGParents). The first episode comes out soon, so they might be worth a follow for the podcast-bereft *Magic* players out there.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Crushed by Tentacles](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-mocs-2016-02-14)

Finishing in 28th place in a *Magic Online* Championship Series Playoff Event is no small feat. With Platinum players invited and a significant set of prizes on the line, the competition is fierce. That's why I'm not sleeping on this 28th-place deck from Tulio\_Jaudy first called out by [Aaron Forsythe](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron/status/698992368842706944) the day after the event. A pure control deck, this blue-black pile of amazing uses [Demonic Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Pact)—remember [Demonic Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Pact)?—to control the game, and then can resets with [Disperse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disperse), [Silumgar's Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Command), or, and here's the kicker, [Crush of Tentacles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crush+of+Tentacles). Throw in [Oath of Jace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Jace) and [Empty the Pits](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Pits), and this deck is basically a collection of awesome cards that never quite made the cut. Maybe they will now.
