The*Lorwyn* artifact [Twinning Glass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twinning+Glass) is all about duality. Mechanically, if if a spell is played, the Glass lets you play a second copy of it. The flavor text tells a little story about the duality behind the construction of this kind of magical mirror. And Franz Vohwinkel’s art of the card bears some secret duality too. Check out the high-resolution art below.

Depending on how you look at it, you might see one of two different images in the Glass. Do you see the girl, or the creepy skull-face?
