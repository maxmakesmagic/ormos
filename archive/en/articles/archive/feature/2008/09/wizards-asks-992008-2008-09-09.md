*What's the biggest comeback you've ever made in a **Magic** game?*


![Dave Guskin](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_daveguskin.jpg)**Dave Guskin:** Before I came to work at Wizards, I played a ton of drafts to improve my Limited game. You see, I had stopped playing through the tail end of high school and college, so I basically missed the invention of Limited formats. When I returned to the game, I was (and continue to be) amazed at how exciting and different each game of Limited could be. I've been in love with Limited ever since.


So it was in a triple-*Ravnica* Draft, running a pretty spicy Boros deck with an extremely aggressive curve of beaters and a couple amazing spells, that I made my biggest comeback ever. I was on the play, and I mulliganed to four, so I was already down. Then my opponent dropped a [Selesnya Evangel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Evangel) on turn two, completely stymieing my changes of dealing any early damage, and I slumped into "out" position. However, my deck served me up the veritable Swiss army knife of tools to get me back on my feet: [Sunforger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunforger)!


[![Sunforger](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/RAV/Sunforger.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sunforger)My opponent was being conservative and just building up tons of Saprolings and burly green creatures ([Bramble Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental) with [Fists of Ironwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fists+of+Ironwood) and [Root-Kin Ally](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Root-Kin+Ally) come to mind) rather than smacking me around. I had a smattering of small creatures (the 2/2 [Veteran Armorer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Armorer) and the 2/1 first striking [Nightguard Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightguard+Patrol)) along with the [Sunforger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunforger)-equipped, Saproling-eating, double-striking [Boros Swiftblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Swiftblade) and the 4/1 "heavyweight" [Ordruun Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordruun+Commando). My opponent felt secure with his impenetrable sapro-defenses, and was still at 20 life. And so, with only one card in hand and stuck at four lands, I won the game on my next attack.

That's right!


I [Bathe in Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Bathe%2Bin%2BLight) my fighting force in Light, granting them protection from green (and hence, his team), and smashed across the red zone. The observant among you will notice that I only have 18 points of damage, even with the [Hammer of Bogardan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Hammer%2Bof%2BBogardan) That Forges Suns attached to my double-striker. That's where [Rally the Righteous](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Righteous) came in to the rescue. I placed my 7 points of first-strike damage on the stack (2 from [Nightguard Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightguard+Patrol) and 5 from [Boros Swiftblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Swiftblade)'s first swing) and then unattached [Sunforger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunforger) to search up [Rally the Righteous](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Righteous), making sure the remainder of my forces got in for the last 13 exactly!


I already had the [Bathe in Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bathe+in+Light) in my hand as I drew for the turn. So in order to win, stuck at my four lands, I just needed to NOT draw the [Rally the Righteous](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Righteous), so that I could get the cost reduction via [Sunforger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunforger)'s unattach ability. It was the *un*-topdeck of the century!
