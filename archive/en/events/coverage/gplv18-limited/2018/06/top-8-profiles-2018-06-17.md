**What color combination did you play on Day 1, and what was your best card?**   

Black-green splashing white to go 7-2. Multani was by far the best card in the deck and the losses came when it could be answered or ignored.


**What color combinations did you draft on Day 2, and what were your best cards?**   

3-0 and 3-0 with blue-red. The first was Wizards and the flying Turtles. [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) played an important role in the end, but [Fight with Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fight+with+Fire) was the keystone.

Kicking [Fight with Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fight+with+Fire) three times.


**What is your favorite part of a MTG event in Vegas?**   

I enjoy seeing so many of my friends and getting to eat great food.


**What would winning GP Vegas mean to you?**   

My first trophy. I can't be a proper hardware engineer without some hardware to take home .
