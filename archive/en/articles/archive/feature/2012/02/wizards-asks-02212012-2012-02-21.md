**Kelly Digges:** Although I'm a big fan of [Vorapede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vorapede), [Flayer of the Hatebound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+of+the+Hatebound), and the adorable [Young Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Wolf), I'm going to cheat a bit here and go with [Mikaeus, the Unhallowed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mikaeus%2C+the+Unhallowed).

![Mikaeus, the Unhallowed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mikaeus%2C+the+Unhallowed)  
OK, so he doesn't *have* undying, but he does *give* undying to all of your other inhuman monstrosities—other Zombies emphatically included. And there are so many ways to bring Zombies in particular back to the battlefield (hello, [Zombie Apocalypse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Apocalypse)!) that even if he does die, it probably won't be for long. And that's while he's making any humans that hit you dead and probably bashing for 5 in there as well.

On top of his game play, though, I absolutely love Mikaeus's role in the story: a human religious leader raised from the dead by Liliana *just so she could pump him for information*. His art is weirdly noble, as befits a fallen cleric, and I love Jenna Helland's excellent [preview story](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/178) about Mikaeus and the fall of Thraben.
