**Ivan Floch:** "No, since I'm the captain of Slovakia I'm already qualified. A local guy, Robert Gregor won, so I'm happy for him."

**Fabrizio Anteri:** "I didn't, because I'm the captain for England. It was won by Low Law however, who's an old time PTQ-grinder. I don't think he has played any Pro Tours, but I've played against him and he's a decent player so I'm happy to have him on the team."

**Thoralf Severin:** "No, I was on vacation with friends, but I probably would have played the same deck as in Prague, which is Blue-White control."

**Michael Bonde:** "Yes. I played Hangerback Abzan with [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang), [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) and [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). I started 5-0, but lost the last two rounds and ended up ninth on tie-breakers."
