Hello, everyone!


*Streets of New Capenna* brings with it several new mechanics, alongside several returning mechanics and one updated mechanic, hideaway. Older cards with the hideaway ability have received errata to accommodate this change. Additionally, there are also several non-functional updates to the Oracle text of older *Magic* cards with the release of this set.


This document is written while the rules and card text changes are still going through editing, so it's possible they'll be a little different from the final changes. When the rules are finalized, you'll be able to see them on the [rules page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules). Once the set is live, official Oracle card text for each card can be found at [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/).


Alright, let's dive in!
