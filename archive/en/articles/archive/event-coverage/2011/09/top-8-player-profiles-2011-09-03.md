**Max Sjöblom**


**Age:** 23  
  
**Hometown:** Helsinki  
  
**Occupation:** Student  
  
**How did you qualify for Pro Tour Philadelphia?** **Magic** Online PTQ  
  
**Number of Grand Prix / Pro Tour Top 8s:**  

PT: 0  

GP: 0  
  
**Other previous **Magic** accomplishments:** Finnish National Champion 2006, Team Worlds 3rd 2006  
  
**What was your record by format?**  

Modern: 6-2-2  

Booster Draft: 6-0  
  
**How did you prepare for Pro Tour Philadelphia? Who did you prepare with?**  

Did a bunch of drafts online and tested with the Finnish guys that were qualified. Switched from Mono G Post to Ascension once I got the list from Ensio.  
  
**How many hours do you spend on **Magic** Online in an average week?**  

10-25, depending on my schedule  
  
**What Modern deck did you play and why?**  
[Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). Got an initial list from Ensio Ask and tuned it. It just seemed insane against the most popular decks.  
  
**What do you think of the new Modern format?**  

Very nice, and infinitely better than Extended, glad about the change. Too bad there are no real control decks that are viable.  
  
**Where do you play Friday Night **Magic**, or if you don't go to FNM anymore, where did you play?**  

Don't really play FNM anymore, used to play at Poromagia and [Safe Haven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safe+Haven).

**Sam Black**


**Age:** 29  
  
**Hometown:** Madison, WI  
  
**Occupation:** Writer for StarCity Games  
  
**How did you qualify for Pro Tour Philadelphia?** Pro Level 6  
  
**Number of Grand Prix / Pro Tour Top 8s:**  

PT: 0 GP: 3  
  
**Other previous **Magic** accomplishments:** Team World Champion, Win-a-Car Tournament winner at Worlds 2007  
  
**What was your record by format?**  

Modern: 7-2-1 Booster Draft: 5-1  
  
**How did you prepare for Pro Tour Philadelphia? Who did you prepare with?**  

Drafting *M12* in Madison all the time. **Magic** Online with John Stolzmann. In person with Zvi Mowshowitz, Gaudenis Vidugiris, Jon Finkel, Tom Martell, and Zaiem Beg.  
  
**How many hours do you spend on **Magic** Online in an average week?**  

Highly variable depending on whether a set has come out physically or online more recently. I probably play **Magic** about 6 hours a day.  
  
**What Modern deck did you play and why?**  

Mono Blue Poison. John Stolzmann told me he had built a deck he thought might be very good. After some changes, we couldn't find anything that beat it.  
  
**What do you think of the new Modern format?**  

I don't think this is what it was supposed to look like. Too much combo. I'd ban [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost), maybe [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal), and unban [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision), maybe Blossom.  
  
**Where do you play Friday Night **Magic**, or if you don't go to FNM anymore, where did you play?**  

Netherworld Games in Madison – the store I founded but no longer own.

0  
  
**What Modern deck did you play and why?**  
[Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), It seemed solid and has good match up against Twelvepost (I think there were many).

La Rocca Di Darksheilon

**Josh Utter-Leyton**


**Age:** 25  
  
**Hometown:** Rohnert Park, CA  
  
**How did you qualify for Pro Tour Philadelphia?** Pro Club Level 7  
  
**Number of Grand Prix / Pro Tour Top 8s:**  

PT: 2 GP: 2  
  
**Other previous **Magic** accomplishments:** 2010 US National Champion  
  
**What was your record by format?**  

Modern: 8-1-1 Booster Draft: 4-2  
  
**How did you prepare for Pro Tour Philadelphia? Who did you prepare with?**  

I spent a week in the woods with the ChannelFireball squad.  
  
**How many hours do you spend on **Magic** Online in an average week?**  

Six.  
  
**What Modern deck did you play and why?**  

Zoo. Every other deck was either [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) or a "belcher" deck -- a deck that could kill on turn two or three but was nearly as likely to turn-six fizzle. Zoo was the most stable deck, and had the best sideboard. What do you think about the new Modern format? I was super excited about the change to Modern for this PT. The way the format developed for this PT (so many flimsy combo decks) has tempered that excitement some, but I think the format will look very different now that the best decks are known.  
  
**Where do you play Friday Night **Magic**, or if you don't go to FNM anymore, where did you play?**  

At ChannelFireball's shop, Superstars!

**How many hours do you spend on **Magic** Online in an average week?**  

A million  
  
**What Modern deck did you play and why?**  
[Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), most consistent combo deck  
  
**What do you think of the new Modern format?**  

Terrible, banned list makes control unplayable

**Occupation:** Poker Pro  
  
**How did you qualify for Pro Tour Philadelphia?** Top 16 GP Dallas  
  
**Number of Grand Prix / Pro Tour Top 8s:**  

PT: 0 GP: 0

**What was your record by format?**  

Modern: 7-1-2 Booster Draft: 5-1  
  
**How did you prepare for Pro Tour Philadelphia? Who did you prepare with?**  

Travis Woo handed me a deck list.  
  
**How many hours do you spend on **Magic** Online in an average week?**  

Zero. What Modern deck did you play, and why? [Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breach)-Post, because I didn't know what to play. I just played what I was given.  
  
**What do you think of the new Modern format?**  

I think the die roll is too important. Also, [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) should be unbanned. Most games end on turn four or five anyways.  
  
**Where do you play Friday Night **Magic**, or if you don't go to FNM anymore, where did you play?**  

I don't play FNM.

After the change of the format, I didn't test at all. I just talked about the format with Italian players at the Pro Tour.  
  
**How many hours do you spend on **Magic** Online in an average week?**  

None  
  
**What Modern deck did you play and why?**

**What do you think of the new Modern format?**  

I like it
