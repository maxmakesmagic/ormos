Pardon the Imposition…
======================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles?source=MX_Nav2020)

IT HAS BEEN SAID that **Magic** is a battle, largely, between iconic two-drop creatures. The linear centerpieces, [Wild Mongrel](javascript:void()) and [Arcbound Ravager](javascript:void()), were champions of their respective Block Constructed formats; the most popular two-drops in their respective Standards; and longtime competitors—including against one another—in big formats as far afield as Extended, Modern, and Legacy.


The Invitational Wizards, [Meddling Mage](javascript:void()) and [Dark Confidant](javascript:void()), have both torn up combo decks and enabled combo decks. They have blocked key cards, drawn extra cards; stood alongside [Isochron Scepter](javascript:void())s and [Dark Depths](javascript:void()); fiddled with [Sensei's Divining Top](javascript:void())s and laughed gleefully at blind [Counterbalance](javascript:void())s. Oh, and [Snapcaster Mage](javascript:void()), of course, has more recently joined their [jeesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Battle_School_students#Ender.27s_jeesh).

The banned [Squire](javascript:void()), [Stoneforge Mystic](javascript:void()), is so good they didn't even have to give her 2 power. She has dominated almost every format they let her play in, so hey—preemptively pink-slipped in Modern.


And [Tarmogoyf](javascript:void())? [Tarmogoyf](javascript:void()) has been everywhere! Seen everything! A singular two-drop of singular size, staunch friend and fearsome foe to every single color.

THE ICONIC TWO-DROPS TELL A STORY. Or, rather, many stories—a story (and more) each. They are the first pages (second pages, really) of the stories we have become so accustomed to. [Wild Mongrel](javascript:void()) is followed by [Arrogant Wurm](javascript:void()) (often during combat) or [Wonder](javascript:void()) gives players an all-new way to be mana screwed. [Arcbound Ravager](javascript:void())'s supporting cast of [Skullclamp](javascript:void()) and [Disciple of the Vault](javascript:void()) were like a parade of banned beaters.


[Stoneforge Mystic](javascript:void()) made for an apt swords(wo)man and looked really good thanks to [Sword of Feast and Famine](javascript:void()) in Standard; [Umezawa's Jitte](javascript:void()) made an ideal partner in Legacy, but it was [Batterskull](javascript:void())—allowing [Stoneforge Mystic](javascript:void()), essentially, to drop a [Baneslayer Angel](javascript:void()) mid-combat—that proved [Stoneforge Mystic](javascript:void())'s too-good mettle against the rest of the field.

IT IS KNOWN that the white two is about the most competitive slot in the history of fantastic creatures. Garfield did it right the first time around with [White Knight](javascript:void()). [White Knight](javascript:void())—first released in Alpha—has been a persistent performer, almost whenever it has been legal to play. [White Knight](javascript:void()) analogues like [Silver Knight](javascript:void()) in *Onslaught* Block and [Hand of Honor](javascript:void()) in Kamigawa Block took down a great many tournaments each. But [White Knight](javascript:void()) itself proved good enough to help Craig Wescoe score a PT Top 8 as recently as 2010... when his opponents were setting records with [Bloodbraid Elf](javascript:void()) and [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](javascript:void()) was making its big debut. Although not the centerpiece of any deck, [White Knight](javascript:void()) was always the picture of efficiency. A 2-power creature for only two mana loaded with abilities, both anti-spell (protection from black) and anti-creature (first strike). [White Knight](javascript:void()) was a "hate bear" when [Necropotence](javascript:void()) was big; a removal dodger in a variety of formats; and a perfect point on the curve nearly every time, across the many generations.
