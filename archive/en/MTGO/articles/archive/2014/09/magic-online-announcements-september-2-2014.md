* Fixed: Corrected cases where mana is incorrectly consumed during cost payment steps.
* Fixed: Corrected cases where effects like [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) would not return exiled permanents immediately.
* Fixed: Corrected cases where [Daring Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daring+Thief) does not correctly exchange control of permanents.
* Fixed: [Spirespine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirespine) can now group block an attacking [Tromokratis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tromokratis).
* Fixed: [Hunting Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Wilds) now correctly untaps permanents when kicked.
