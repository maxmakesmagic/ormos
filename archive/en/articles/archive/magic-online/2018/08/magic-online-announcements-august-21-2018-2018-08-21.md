Chaos Draft Starts Tomorrow
---------------------------


We are really excited for the start of *Chaos Draft* tomorrow! Each person that participates will get three packs, and each booster pack is from a random set. No one will have the same set packs as you, which makes for a lot of chaotic fun! To read more about the development of *Chaos Draft*, check out [this article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/developing-chaos-draft-2018-08-15). To see the prize structure of the event, head [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-mid-year-update-2018-07-31)**.**

Nexus of Fate Update
--------------------



Now that quite a few [Nexus of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nexus+of+Fate) cards have made it out into the wild, we are dialing back the drop rate. Not to worry though, you still have the chance to come across them in Treasure Chests!
