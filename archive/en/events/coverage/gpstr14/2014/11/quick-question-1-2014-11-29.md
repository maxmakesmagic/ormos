We asked some of the best players in the room about the most underrated card in *Khans of Tarkir* Limited. Here's what they had to say:

***Patrick Dickmann:** [Secret Plans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secret+Plans) and [Trail of Mystery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trail+of+Mystery) used to be underrated but, I guess, not anymore. [Tormenting Voice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormenting+Voice) still is much better than it gets credit for.*

***Willy Edel:** [Jeskai Student](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Student). [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) and [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds) are better, but [Jeskai Student](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Student) is good too. I always see it wheeling in drafts and that just shouldn't happen.*

***Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:** [Rite of the Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+the+Serpent).* 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpstr14/qq_shenhar.jpg)
***Shahar Shenhar:** [Valley Dasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valley+Dasher).* 







![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpstr14/qq_anteri.jpg)
***Fabrizio Anteri:** I really like [Leaping Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaping+Master). Like, really.* 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpstr14/qq_juza.jpg)
***Martin JÅ¯za:** [Rotting Mastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotting+Mastodon). Very stable.*
