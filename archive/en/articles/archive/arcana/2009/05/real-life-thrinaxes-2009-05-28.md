You are, of course, familiar with the Thrinax. In *Shards of Alara*, it looked like this:

In *Conflux*, it looked like this:

That's right! Thrinaxes are actually based on a real creature, who lived somewhere around 245 million years ago. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrinaxodon), it was probably fur-covered and cat-sized but still laid eggs. Freaky!
