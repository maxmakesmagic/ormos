Dragons of Tarkir Update Bulletin
=================================

Matt Tabak is the reigning, defending, and undisputed rules manager for Magic: The Gathering, Kaijudo, and Duel Masters. Matt Tabak is Gruul. Matt Tabak tries to laugh, think, and cry every day. Matt Tabak is hungry. Matt Tabak doesn't want you to sass him. Matt Tabak loves puppies.
 





The Update Bulletin is my opportunity to tell interested players and judges all about the changes we make with each new set to the Comp Rules and to Oracle. And this Update Bulletin does that, with one small caveat: we didn't make a lot of changes this time. Thinking about why this happened, I think I know exactly who to blame: Sarkhan Vol. He made a bunch of changes to Tarkir, and look what happened! There are Dragons flying around everywhere, and poor Zurgo has been reduced to a bellstriker. It's terrifying!



On this world, the truth is that most of the changes we had in the pipeline have been pushed off until *Magic Origins* for various reasons. So this time, we have some morph-inspired updates, as well as a small number of changes to the Comp Rules. Enjoy this brief respite, gentle readers.



If you come across a rule, card, or anything *Magic* you'd like to see changed, why not tell me about it? You can find me on Twitter ([@TabakRules](https://twitter.com/@TabakRules)) or Tumblr ([tabakrules.tumblr.com](http://tabakrules.tumblr.com/)). I'd love to hear from you.
