If you have RSS newsfeed reader software, an RSS browser plugin, or another way of reading RSS feeds, point it at

![XML news feed](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/xml_rss.gif) **<http://www.wizards.com/rss.asp?x=magic>**

to read **magicthegathering.com** headlines in a brand new way.

### What is RSS?

RSS (RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) is an XML (eXtensible Markup Language)-based protocol for syndicating content. It's an easy way for websites to share headlines and summarized content to web surfers or to other sites. [Learn more about RSS.](http://webmonkey.wired.com/webmonkey/03/17/index3a.html)


### Where can I get an RSS reader?

You can find a list of RSS readers at <http://blogspace.com/rss/readers>.

### What else should I know?

**Magicthegathering.com**'s RSS feed currently uses the RSS .91 standard. You can find RSS feeds for other Wizards of the Coast games [here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=welcome/rss).
