When we say "the face of **Magic**, what do you think of? [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel)? [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon)? [Maro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Maro)?


Well, what if we were to tell you (or, in the case of the old-time players, *remind* you) that for years and years, the face of the game was . . . [Hurloon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurloon+Minotaur):

This guy was *everywhere*, from denim jackets to the rulebook. When Wizards of the Coast opened a fancy Game Center in Seattle, guess who was there to greet people?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1563_pin.jpg)*In handsome pin form*  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1563_Tailcoat.jpg)*A prototype Hurloon Minotaur tailcoat (only one was ever made!)*  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1563_jacket.jpg)*The Hurloon Minotaur denim jacket (sold only to Wizards of the Coast employees back in 1995 or so)*
So, in honor of the former Face of the Game, here's a larger version of our old friend, the [Hurloon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurloon+Minotaur).
