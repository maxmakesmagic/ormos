Hello, everyone!


The Update Bulletin is the place to find information about changes to the *Magic* Comprehensive Rules that came along with the most recent set's release, as well as updates to the official text of some cards. You can find the complete rules document on the [rules page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules), and you can find the official Oracle card text for each card on [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=508148).


Alright. Let's dive in!
