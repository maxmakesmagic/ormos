2001 Grand Prix Hiroshima Coverage
----------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gp_lg.gif)After twelve hours of intense mental battle we were left with just two great Japanese superstars to determine who would walk out 2001 Grand Prix Hiroshima Champion. The stage was set for a classic showdown between back to back and current APAC Champion Masaya Mori and 1999 National Champion Masayuki Higashino.


It also faced the two most popular deck archetypes against each other, Higashino playing the aggressive black/red/blue and Mori playing green/white/blue. With a large audience and Hobby Japan reporters watching the match, the pressure was on both these veterans of the spotlight and the attention didn't seem to bother them at all.


Higashino was cool, calm, and collected in taking the match 2-0 and becoming the 2001 Grand Prix Hiroshima Champion pocketing an impressive week-end earnings of $2,400.
