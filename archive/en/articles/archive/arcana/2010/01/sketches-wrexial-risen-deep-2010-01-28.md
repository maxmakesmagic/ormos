Welcome to another edition of Sketches! Today we dive back into *Worldwake,* only to meet something rising out of the deep!

  
### Artist Portfolio

Artist [Eric Deschamps](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Eric+Deschamps%22%5D) has illustrated 11 **Magic** cards, starting with [Goblin S.W.A.T. Team](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+S.W.A.T.+Team) and [Pygmy Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pygmy+Giant) in *Unhinged* and [Rod of Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rod+of+Ruin) in *Ninth Edition*.

### Art Description

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions given to Eric for Wrexial, the Risen Deep:


> 
> *Color: Blue/black creature*
> 
> 
> 
> *Location: Water (perhaps in deep, murky waters or breaching the ocean's surface) Action: This is a legendary kraken of the deep, the one shown on pg. 72(B) of the style guide. He's an enormous beast, a king of the deep and possessed of eldritch magics that should not be uttered. Feel free to add/change details to make him a unique monster.*
> 
> 
> 
> *Focus: Wrexial the Kraken Mood: When he shows up, bad things are about to happen. Notes:*
> 
> 
> 

The next step is for the artist to submit sketches of his or her vision of the art description.

### Sketches

Here's Eric's initial sketch.

The creative team liked the general angle but asked for Wrexial to be beefed up a little.

### Finished Card

The card itself? Well, that will have to wait until the *Worldwake* Prerelease this weekend. It's worth it!
