Amateur Wins in Kyoto!
======================




March 17-18, 2007












[日本語の取材へ](/en/node/560136)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpkyo07/champ.jpg)In the first round of quick questions this weekend, Japanese Legend Kenji Tsumura boldly stated that the relatively unknown amateur Yuuya Watanabe would win this Grand Prix… and wouldn't you know it?

With a huge [Demonfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire) off the top, Watanabe snatched the last game of the match away from Yuusuke Iwasaki to become the Grand Prix Kyoto Champion. Watanabe was last seen heading due east carried high on the shoulders of his many friends and supporters.
