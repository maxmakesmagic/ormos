Welcome once again to the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. As always, Prerelease weekend is a time for our Pros to catch a breath from Premier play, study the new set, and take it for a test drive at their local game store. As a result, our Top 25 remains unchanged this week. However, if you wanted Premier play, Las Vegas, Nevada, was the place to go. That's where you could have faced the likes of Ben Stark, William Jensen, Gabriel Nassif, and World No. 1 Eric Froehlich, plus card masters like David Williams and Brock Parker. In the end, it was Froehlich who emerged from the scrum to claim the Prerelease title. This adds to a glittering career that has every chance of seeing him join Stark, Jensen, and Nassif in the Hall of Fame.



However much they learned at their Prerelease weekends, the Pros will now be hard at work trying to unravel the intricacies of the new Standard. That before getting their collective hands on lots and lots of *Magic Origins* booster packs, ready to dig into Draft action ahead of Pro Tour *Magic Origins*, which is now just two weeks away. In between, there's one Grand Prix. Dallas/Fort Worth will see the final jockeying for position ahead of the Big Show that will see a new Player of the Year crowned. Can Froehlich make it Prerelease, Hall of Fame, and Player of the Year all in one crazy month?



Join us next week for more from the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
