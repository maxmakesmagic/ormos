Ask Wizards is a monthly feature that gives you a chance to ask us questions and have them answered. If you'd like to submit a question, please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive, [but if we can](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-tuesday-june-17-2014-06-17), it might show up in the coming months!


An overwhelming army (well, three) of cunning questions about Zombies, lands, and decks awaits!

**Q: Since [Undead Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Warchief) reduces the cost of Zombie spells by 1, does this include the sorcery: [Army of the Damned](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Army+of+the+Damned)? —Russell** 


**A:** No. A spell is a Zombie spell only if it has "Zombie" in the type line. Since there are no Zombie [tribal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Tribal%22%5d) spells, the Warchief only reduces [Zombie creature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Creature%22%5d&subtype=+%5b%22Zombie%22%5d) spells.


But ah-ah-ah, that's not entirely true, because of [changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5b%22changeling%22%5d)! That ability can give the Zombie creature type (and every other creature type) to [noncreature spells](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5b%22changeling%22%5d&type=+!%5b%22creature%22%5d). Those spells would also get a discount from [Undead Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Warchief).

**Q: Will the next expansion come out with new lands linked to three colors? —Rafael**


**A:** Yes! There are indeed three-color lands in *Khans of Tarkir*, as shown in Blake's [*Duel Decks: Speed vs. Cunning* article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/duel-decks-speed-vs-cunning-2014-08-18). And also right here:

**Q: I'm pretty overwhelmed by all the different types of decks. I'm brand new to *Magic* and am looking for a deck and/or decks to play with my brother. I'm just wondering what you think would be the best option? —Phill** 


**A:** Welcome to the game and the community, Phill! :) What kind of deck to pick up depends quite a bit on what kind of *Magic* you want to play. It can be daunting, so let me break it down a little for you:



* **Casual:** If you want to grab a deck or two and just play with whomever, the decks in [*Duel Decks: Speed vs. Cunning*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/duel-decks-speed-vs-cunning) are a decent place to start. Casual *Magic* is far and away the most popular, and you can find people interested in playing it anywhere.
* **Standard:** With [*Magic 2015*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-2015-core-set-card-set-archive-products-game-info), we introduced [Clash Packs](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/magic-2015-core-set-clash-pack-decklists), which are two 60-card decks you can play as-is or combine into a single, more powerful deck. The most popular competitive format for *Magic* is Standard. We will also be releasing an Event Deck shortly after [*Khans of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/khans-of-tarkir) comes out. Event Decks are designed to be fairly competitive in Standard.
* **Modern:** Earlier this year, we released a [Modern Event Deck](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/modern-event-deck) meant to do for that format what expansion-based Event Decks do for Standard. If you're interested in Modern, that deck is a great place to start.


I hope that helps!
