The 2000 Canadian National Championship was the first large event to feature Standard decks with Prophecy. Two of the decks changed by Prophecy are featured below.

Gary Krakower is using Prophecy's Rhystic Lightning, which does four damage for three mana if the recipient can't pay to stop it. He's also playing Veteran Brawlers, a 4/4 for two mana that can only attack if the defending player doesn't control an untapped land. The deck thus combines land destruction with cards that punish an opponent for not having enough land.
