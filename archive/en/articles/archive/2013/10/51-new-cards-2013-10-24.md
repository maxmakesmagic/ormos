There are 51 new cards in the *Commander* (2013 Edition) decks. For those of you haven't seen them before [we announced all five decklists](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/269c) last Friday. Now here's a collection of all 51 new cards, I will be doing another arcana in the near future to highlight the reprints that got new art!


Underneath each card below you'll see which deck, or decks, the card is available in, as well as the three colors of that deck. At the end of the Arcana is a poll where you can vote on a *Commander* (2013 Edition) wallpaper!
