Oh, hello! Is it time for *Dark Ascension* previews already? My, my, how time flies. Well, you've probably already seen the big introduction to [*Dark Ascension* Mechanics](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/177). And you've certainly read [Mark Rosewater's preview article](/en/articles/archive/dancing-dark-ascension-part-1-2012-01-09). So there's hardly anything left to do.

Except, perhaps, to show you all the delicious alternate-art foil cards that will be available (while supplies last) at various *Dark Ascension* events. Let's do that!

### *Dark Ascension* Prerelease

The *Dark Ascension* Prerelease is January 28-29, which seems so far away now. But it's only three weeks! Less than that, in fact. And here's what's available for playing in one. While supplies last.

### *Dark Ascension* Launch Party

A week after the prerelease, *Dark Ascension* goes on sale for real on February 3. And that kicks off the Launch Party, where this foil card lives:

Just like the prerelease card, you'll get it just for participating (while supplies last). 

### *Dark Ascension* Game Day


*Dark Ascension* Game Day is February 25-26, and while supplies last, you'll get this for participating:

And if you make the Top 8, you'll get this!

### *Dark Ascension* Buy-a-Box Card

Finally, here's the "Buy-a-Box" card! It goes to the first twenty people to buy a Booster Box of *Dark Ascension* at participating locations. We'll post the locations later, but here's the card now!
