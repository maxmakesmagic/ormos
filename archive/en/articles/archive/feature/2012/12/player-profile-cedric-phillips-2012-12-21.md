### You, **Magic**, and **Magic Online**


**How long have you played Magic?**  

14+ years


**What is the first set you remember from Magic?**  
*Ice Age*. [Woolly Mammoths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woolly+Mammoths) ftw!


**How did you learn to play Magic, or who taught you?**  

My best friend in elementary school, John Cross, taught me how to play on the bus. We originally became friends because I couldn't beat Sigma's Dog in *Megaman X* and I caught wind that he could. Then he showed me what a [Polar Kraken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polar+Kraken) wasâ€¦


**How long have you played Magic Online?**  

8+ years.


**Do you stream? If so, what's your channel URL?**  
[www.twitch.tv/ceddyp](http://www.twitch.tv/ceddyp)


**How often do you draft on Magic Online?**  

If a Limited event is coming up, four or five times a day for two to three weeks until the event begins.


**How often do you play Constructed on Magic Online?**  

If a Constructed event is coming up, five to eight hours a day for two to three weeks until the event begins.


**Do you play any casual formats on Magic Online?**   

Nah. I'm too competitive and don't know how to turn it off.


### Magic Online's Beta Client


**Have you tried the Wide Beta client?**  

Some. I've mostly watched Michael Jacob play on it via his stream.


**What's your favorite change that has been made?**   

Honestly, not a ton of things have been made that much better. =(


**What are you looking for us to do on it that we haven't done yet?**  

Leagues were something that people loved with the old client. I also like checking ratings of my opponent and having clan affiliation mean something.


### Your Favorites


**Favorite formats to play on Magic Online:**   

Legacy


**Favorite draft format:**  

Three answers actually: MMD, RGD, and M13


**Favorite Magic Card:**  
[Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny)


**Favorite piece of Magic art:**   

Currently, I really like the new [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) artwork a lot


**Favorite Planeswalker card:**  
[Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) (surprised?)


### *Return to Ravnica*


**What do you think of *Return to Ravnica*?**   

I like the idea of going back to Ravnica but I have fond memories of how things used to be back in my college days, and it would be impossible for anything to come that close again in my opinion.


**Did you play during the original Ravnica?**  

Far too much.


**Favorite guild to draft in *Return to Ravnica*?**   

Rakdos.


**What's your favorite non-rare first pack first pick in *Return to Ravnica* draft?**   
[Rix Maadi Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rix+Maadi+Guildmage)


### Silly Questions


**If you were to get a **Magic** tattoo (or already have one) what would it be?**   

The full artwork of [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) ON MY BACK.


**If you could play Magic against anyone, who would it be and why?**  

Gabe Walls, because he is impossible to read and is a ton of fun to play against.
