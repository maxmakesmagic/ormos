An FAQ is a collection of clarifications and rulings involving the cards in a new **Magic: The Gathering** set. It's intended to make playing with these new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [www.wizards.com/customerservice](http://www.wizards.com/customerservice).


This FAQ has two sections, each of which serves a different purpose.


The first section ("General Notes") explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The second section ("Card-Specific Notes") contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**New Card Layout: Double-Faced Cards**


**New Keyword Action: Transform**


On the world of Innistrad, many creatures hide a darker aspect. The *Innistrad* set introduces double-faced cards, the first traditional **Magic** cards ever to not have the \_Deckmaster\_ card back. Instead, they have two faces: a front face and a back face. A new keyword action, transform, allows you to turn the card over to its other face under certain conditions.


The front face of the card has a sun symbol in its upper left corner. The back face has a moon symbol in its upper left corner. Other than distinguishing one face from the other, these symbols have no effect on game play.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (front face)
 Cloistered Youth
 Creature -- Human
 1/1
 At the beginning of your upkeep, you may transform Cloistered Youth. | (back face)
 Unholy Fiend
 \*black\*
 Creature -- Horror
 3/3
 At the beginning of your end step, you lose 1 life. |

The official rules for double-faced cards are as follows:



> 
> 711. Double-Faced Cards
> 
> 
> 711.1. Each double-faced card has a **Magic** card face on each side rather than a **Magic** card face on one side and a **Magic** card back on the other. Each face may have abilities that allow the permanent to "transform," or turn over to its other face. Tokens and cards with a **Magic** card back can't transform. (See rule 701.25, "Transform.")
> 
> 
> 711.1a A double-faced card's front face is indicated by the sun symbol in its upper left corner.
> 
> 
> 711.1b A double-faced card's back face is indicated by the moon symbol in its upper left corner.
> 
> 
> 711.1c While a double-faced card is in a public zone, each player may look at both faces.
> 
> 
> 711.1d If the back face of a double-sided card is a creature, the front face of that card will have the back face's power and toughness printed in italicized gray text in the lower right of its text box. This is reminder text and has no effect on game play.
> 
> 
> 711.2. Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics.
> 
> 
> 711.2a In every zone other than the battlefield, and also on the battlefield with its front face up, a double-faced card has only the characteristics of its front face.
> 
> 
> 711.2b While a double-faced permanent's back face is up, it has only the characteristics of its back face. The back face doesn't have a mana cost; it has the colors in its color indicator (see rule 202.2e).
> 
> 
> 711.3. Except for determining whether or not a permanent can transform, a spell, ability, or rule that needs information about a double-faced permanent sees only the information given by the face that's currently up.
> 
> 
> Example: A [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone) enters the battlefield as a copy of Wildblood Pack (the back face of a double-faced card). [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone) will be a copy of Wildblood Pack. Because [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone) is itself not a double-faced card, it can't transform.
> 
> 
> Example: A player casts Cytoshape, causing a Kruin Outlaw (the front face of a double-faced card) to become a copy of Elite Vanguard (a 2/1 Human Soldier creature) until the end of turn. The player then casts Moonmist, which reads, in part, "Transform all Humans." Because the copy of Elite Vanguard is a double-faced card, it will transform. The resulting permanent will have its back face up, although it will still be a copy of Elite Vanguard that turn.
> 
> 
> 711.4. If a double-faced card is cast as a spell, it's put on the stack with its front face up. A double-faced card can't be cast face down. See rule 601, "Casting Spells."
> 
> 
> 711.5. A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up.
> 
> 
> 711.6. A double-faced permanent always has the status "face up" (see rule 110.6). Double-faced permanents can't be turned face down. If a spell or ability tries to turn a double-faced permanent face down, nothing happens.
> 
> 
> 711.7. When a double-faced permanent transforms, it doesn't become a new object. Any effects that applied to that permanent will continue to apply to it after it transforms.
> 
> 
> Example: An effect gives Village Ironsmith (the front face of a double-faced card) +2/+2 until end of turn and then Village Ironsmith transforms into Ironfang. Ironfang will continue to get +2/+2 until the end of turn.
> 
> 
> 711.8. If an effect instructs a player to name a card, the player may name either face of a double-faced card but not both.
> 
> 
> 711.9. Players must ensure that double-faced cards in hidden zones are indistinguishable from other cards in the same zone. To do this, the owner of a double-faced card may use completely opaque card sleeves or substitute a checklist card. Sanctioned tournaments have additional rules for playing with double-faced cards. See rule 100.6.
> 
> 
> 711.9a If a checklist card is used, the double-faced card it represents must be set aside prior to the beginning of the game (see rule 103.1a) and must be available throughout the game. A checklist card can't be included in a deck unless it is representing a double-faced card.
> 
> 
> 711.9b The face of each checklist card is divided into sections. Each section lists the name and mana cost of each double-faced card it could represent and includes a fill-in circle. When using a checklist card, exactly one of the fill-in circles must be marked to denote which double-faced card the checklist card represents.
> 
> 
> 711.9c For all game purposes, a checklist card is considered to be the double-faced card it's representing. It has that double-faced card's characteristics in all zones.
> 
> 
> 711.9d As a checklist card enters a public zone, the checklist card should be set aside and the double-faced card used instead.
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for transform are as follows:



> 
> 701.25. Transform
> 
> 
> 701.25a Only permanents represented by double-faced cards can transform. (See rule 711, "Double-Faced Cards.") If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform any permanent that isn't a double-faced card, nothing happens.
> 
> 
> 701.25b To transform a permanent, turn it over so that its other face is up.
> 
> 
> 701.25c Although transforming a permanent uses the same physical action as turning a permanent face up or face down, they are different game actions. Abilities that trigger when a permanent is turned face down won't trigger when that permanent transforms, and so on.
> 
> 
> \* Each face of a double-faced card has its own name, types, subtypes, power and toughness, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is not on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored.
> 
> 
> \* The back face of a double-faced card can't be cast.
> 
> 
> \* A double-faced card enters the battlefield with the front face up.
> 
> 
> \* The back face of a double-faced card doesn't have a mana cost; a double-faced permanent with its back face up has a converted mana cost of 0.
> 
> 
> \* The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.
> 
> 
> \* Only a double-faced permanent can transform. "Double-faced" always refers to the physical card. It is neither a characteristic nor a copiable value. For example, a token can never be a double-faced permanent even if it's a copy of one.
> 
> 
> \* Transforming a permanent doesn't affect any Auras or Equipment attached to that permanent. Similarly, any counters on the permanent will remain on that permanent after it transforms.
> 
> 
> \* Damage marked on a double-faced permanent will stay marked on that permanent after it transforms.
> 
> 
> 


**Theme: Double-Faced Werewolves**


Each Werewolf creature in the *Innistrad* set is a double-faced card. Each front face has the same triggered ability that may transform it. Similarly, each back face has the same triggered ability that may transform it back.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (front)
 Tormented Pariah
 Creature -- Human Warrior Werewolf
 3/2
 At the beginning of each upkeep, if no spells were cast last turn, transform Tormented Pariah. | (back)
 Rampaging Werewolf
 \*red\*
 Creature -- Werewolf
 6/4
 At the beginning of each upkeep, if a player cast two or more spells last turn, transform Rampaging Werewolf. |

</sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_legacy_migration/flipcard/flipcard_big.html?ca=2oe29z4pu2&cb=b9m8p40fgc&lang=en>


* These abilities look at the entire previous turn, even if the Werewolf with that ability wasn't on the battlefield for some or all of that turn.
* For the back-face triggered abilities, a single player must have cast two or more spells during the previous turn. If multiple players each cast just one spell during the previous turn, the ability won't trigger.
* A player who casts the same card twice during the same turn (perhaps due to the flashback ability) has cast two different spells that turn. The back-face triggered ability will trigger at the beginning of the next turn's upkeep.

**New Characteristic: Color Indicator**


Each back face of an *Innistrad* double-faced card has a small dot to the left of its type line. This circular symbol is its "color indicator." A permanent with a red color indicator, for example, is red, just as a card with a red mana symbol in its mana cost is red. A color indicator may represent multiple colors.


Some older cards were printed with a characteristic-defining ability in its rules text box that indicated what color that card was, such as "[Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) is green" and "[Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation) is blue." These cards are receiving updated Oracle wordings to use color indicators instead. This is a minor functional change in some cases: a color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects like that of [Mind Bend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Bend), and [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) now remains green when [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) is on the battlefield.


**Game Supplement: Checklist Cards**


![Innistrad Checklist Card](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/isd/g4cc1x3ges_en.jpg)* It's important that the cards in your deck be indistinguishable from one another. To accomplish this with double-faced cards, you can use the checklist cards included in some *Innistrad* booster packs and in the *Innistrad* fat pack. These checklist cards have a list of all double-faced cards in the *Innistrad* set on one side and the typical **Magic** card back on the other side.
* You must have with you the actual double-faced card the checklist card is representing. The double-faced card should be kept apart from the rest of your deck. In tournaments, the double-faced card should also be kept separate from your sideboard.
* A checklist card can't be included in a deck except when it's being used to represent a double-faced card.
* You must mark exactly one fill-in circle on the checklist card to indicate which double-faced card it represents.
* You can still use card sleeves, even if you also choose to use checklist cards.
* During the game, a checklist card is considered to be the double-faced card it represents. For example, say you have a checklist card in your hand representing Tormented Pariah and an opponent casts [Despise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Despise). The checklist card is a creature card, so your opponent may choose the checklist card and you would discard it.
* As soon as a checklist card enters a public zone (stack, battlefield, graveyard, or exile unless it's exiled face down), use the double-faced card and set the checklist card aside. If the double-faced card is put into a hidden zone (hand or library), use the checklist card again.
* If a double-faced card is exiled face down, keep its identity hidden by using the face-down checklist card.

**New Ability Word: Morbid**


Morbid is an ability word. It appears in italics at the beginning of abilities that check to see if a creature has died that turn. (An ability word has no rules meaning.)



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/isd/1ev40j138a_en.jpg)Festerhide Boar  
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)  
> 
> Creature -- Boar  
> 
> 3/3  
> 
> Trample  
> 
> Morbid -- Festerhide Boar enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it if a creature died this turn.


* Morbid abilities merely check if a creature died earlier in the turn. The creature card doesn't need to still be in the graveyard.
* Token creatures can also die, going to their owner's graveyard before ceasing to exist.
* Some morbid abilities that appear on instants and sorceries use the word "instead." The spells have an upgraded effect when they resolve if a creature has died earlier in the turn. You only get the upgraded effect, not both effects.
* Some morbid abilities are activated abilities of permanents. To activate such an ability, a creature must have died earlier in the turn.
* Triggered morbid abilities use an intervening "if" clause. A creature must have died earlier in the turn in order for these abilities to trigger; otherwise they do nothing. In other words, there's no way to have the ability trigger if no creature has died that turn, even if you intend to have a creature die in response to the triggered ability.

**Returning Keyword Ability: Flashback**


Flashback is a keyword that has previously appeared in the *Odyssey* and *Time Spiral* blocks.



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/isd/7cf8iav13t_en.jpg)Dream Twist  
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  
> 
> Instant  
> 
> Target player puts the top three cards of his or her library into his or her graveyard.  
> 
> Flashback ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) (You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)


The official rules for flashback are as follows:



> 
> 702.32. Flashback
> 
> 
> 702.32a Flashback appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities: one that functions while the card is in a player's graveyard and the other that functions while the card is on the stack. "Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack." Casting a spell using its flashback ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e-g.
> 
> 
> \* You must still follow any timing restrictions, including those based on the card's type. You can only cast a sorcery using flashback when you could normally cast a sorcery.
> 
> 
> \* Casting a spell using flashback doesn't change the mana cost (or converted mana cost) of the spell. You just pay the flashback cost instead.
> 
> 
> \* Effects that cause you to pay more or less when casting a spell will also affect what you pay when casting the spell using flashback.
> 
> 
> \* A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.
> 
> 
> 


**New Subtype: Curse**


The *Innistrad* set includes six Auras with enchant player that have a negative effect for the enchanted player. These enchantments have the additional subtype "Curse."



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/isd/pjbi8d8dym_en.jpg)Curse of the Pierced Heart  
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  
> 
> Enchantment -- Aura Curse  
> 
> Enchant player  
> 
> At the beginning of enchanted player's upkeep, Curse of the Pierced Heart deals 1 damage to that player.


* A Curse spell targets the player it will enchant like any other Aura spell, and a Curse stays on the battlefield like any other Aura. If the enchanted player gains protection from the Curse's color (or any other characteristic the Curse has), the Curse will be put into its owner's graveyard.
* Each of the Curses can be attached to any player, including the player who cast the Curse.
* Curse is an enchantment type, not a creature type (or any other kind of subtype).
* Two *Innistrad* cards, Bitterheart Witch and Witchbane Orb, have abilities that refer to Curses.

**Theme: Vampires with +1/+1 Counters**


Some Vampires on Innistrad thrive on the blood of their enemies and get stronger when they deal combat damage to a player.



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/isd/r0u2zpnq5t_en.jpg)Stromkirk Noble  
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  
> 
> Creature -- Vampire  
> 
> 1/1  
> 
> Stromkirk Noble can't be blocked by Humans.  
> 
> Whenever Stromkirk Noble deals combat damage to a player, put a +1/+1 counter on it.


* The +1/+1 counter isn't put on the creature in time to increase the amount of combat damage dealt during that combat step.
* If such a creature has double strike, the +1/+1 counter put on the creature when first-strike damage is dealt will increase the amount of damage dealt during the regular combat damage step.
* If such a creature deals combat damage to multiple players simultaneously, perhaps because some combat damage was redirected, its ability will trigger for each of those players.

**New Keyword Action: Fight**


The *Innistrad* set introduces the rules term "fight."



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/isd/jsf6n1wvsc_en.jpg)Prey Upon  
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)  
> 
> Sorcery  
> 
> Target creature you control fights target creature you don't control. (Each deals damage equal to its power to the other.)


The official rules for fight are as follows:



> 
> 701.10. Fight
> 
> 
> 701.10a A spell or ability may instruct a creature to fight another creature. To fight, each creature deals damage equal to its power to the other creature. When such a spell or ability resolves, if either creature is no longer on the battlefield, is no longer a creature, or is otherwise an illegal target (if the spell or ability targeted that creature), no damage is dealt.
> 
> 
> 701.10b If a creature fights itself, it deals damage equal to its power to itself twice.
> 
> 
> 701.10c The damage dealt when a creature fights isn't combat damage.
> 
> 
> \* The damage is dealt simultaneously.
> 
> 
> \* The amount of damage each creature deals is equal to its power when the spell or ability that instructs the creatures to fight resolves.
> 
> 
> \* Five older cards will receive updated Oracle wordings to include the new term. (Several cards with similar effects won't be updated. Most of those cards involve potentially more than two creatures dealing damage or damage that is dealt sequentially rather than simultaneously.)
> 
> 
> 


**Cycle: Enemy "Tap Lands"**


The *Innistrad* set has a cycle of lands that produce two colors of mana and enter the battlefield tapped unless you control a certain land.



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/isd/ee6xlfaoib_en.jpg)Hinterland Harbor  
> 
> Land  
> 
> Hinterland Harbor enters the battlefield tapped unless you control a Forest or an Island.  
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif): Add ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) or ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) to your mana pool.


* These lands check for lands you control with either of the two listed land types, not either of the two listed names. The lands they check for don't have to be basic lands. For example, if you control [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground) (a nonbasic land with the land types Mountain and Forest), Hinterland Harbor will enter the battlefield untapped.
* As these lands are entering the battlefield, they check for lands that are already on the battlefield. They won't see lands that are entering the battlefield at the same time (due to [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)'s ability, for example).

Abilities that reduce the cost to cast a creature spell won't apply, and additional costs to cast that creature can't be paid. If the card has an ability that allows another cost to be paid "rather than its mana cost," that alternative cost can be paid.

* If a Blazing Torch controlled by one player somehow winds up equipping a creature a different player controls, the damage ability can't be activated by either player. Only the creature's controller may activate the ability -- but since that player can't sacrifice Blazing Torch (a permanent he or she doesn't control), the ability's cost can't be paid.
* The source of the damage is Blazing Torch, not the equipped creature. However, the equipped creature's ability is what targets the creature or player. If Blazing Torch is equipped to a red creature, for example, the ability couldn't target a creature with protection from red. It could target a creature with protection from artifacts, but all the damage would be prevented.

* You don't flip the coin until the ability resolves. If you want to respond to the ability, perhaps by regenerating the damaged creature, you'll have to do so before you know the outcome of the flip.
* If the combat damage Creepy Doll deals to a creature is lethal, you'll still flip a coin. If the creature is still on the battlefield (perhaps because it regenerated), it could be destroyed a second time, depending on the coin flip.

* Any damage dealt by the enchanted creature to an opponent will cause Curiosity to trigger, not just combat damage.
* Curiosity doesn't trigger if the enchanted creature deals damage to a planeswalker controlled by an opponent.

* The enchanted player still chooses which player or planeswalker each creature he or she controls attacks.
* If there are multiple combat phases in a turn, each creature must attack only in the first one in which it's able to.
* If, during the enchanted player's declare attackers step, a creature he or she controls is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under that player's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having the creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.

> As long as Dearly Departed is in your graveyard, each Human creature you control enters the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on it.


* The effect is cumulative. Human creatures you control will enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter for each Dearly Departed in your graveyard.
* In most cases, when determining whether a creature entering the battlefield under your control should get a +1/+1 counter, you'll simply look at what the creature will look like on the battlefield. You'll consider any effects affecting a creature entering the battlefield under your control that fall under one of these categories:


	+ Replacement effects that have already modified how the permanent enters the battlefield, like the one created by [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone).
	+ Continuous effects that changed the permanent's creature type on the stack, like the one created by Artificial Evolution.
	+ Effects from the permanent's own static abilities, as long as they affect only that permanent, like [Adaptive Automaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adaptive+Automaton)'s.
* However, you'll ignore the continuous effects of static abilities that come from other sources. For example, if you control [Xenograft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenograft) with Human as the chosen creature type, a Vampire creature would not enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter.

> Creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of Essence of the Wild.


* Creatures you control don't copy whether Essence of the Wild is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* Because creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of Essence of the Wild, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities printed on such creatures won't trigger.
* Replacement effects that modify how a creature enters the battlefield are applied in the following order: first control-changing effects (such as [Gather Specimens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gather+Specimens)), then copy effects (such as the abilities of Essence of the Wild and [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone)), then all other effects. This is a minor rules change to make Essence of the Wild and similar cards in the future work intuitively.
* If a creature such as [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone) is entering the battlefield under your control, there will be two copy effects to apply: the creature's own and Essence of the Wild's. No matter what order these effects are applied, the creature will be a copy of Essence of the Wild when it enters the battlefield.
* Other enters-the-battlefield replacement abilities printed on the creature entering the battlefield won't be applied because the creature will already be Essence of the Wild at that point (and therefore it won't have those abilities). For example, a creature that normally enters the battlefield tapped will enter the battlefield as an untapped Essence of the Wild, and a creature that would normally enter the battlefield with counters on it will enter the battlefield as an Essence of the Wild with no counters.
* External abilities may still affect how a creature enters the battlefield. For example, if your opponent controls [Urabrask the Hidden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urabrask+the+Hidden), which reads, in part, "Creatures your opponents control enter the battlefield tapped," a creature entering the battlefield under your control will be a tapped Essence of the Wild.
* If a creature such as [Cryptoplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptoplasm) that's already on the battlefield copies Essence of the Wild and modifies its own copy effect, that modification is also copied by creatures entering the battlefield under your control.
* If you control more than one Essence of the Wild, creatures you control will enter the battlefield as a copy of the one whose copy effect you apply last.

* Evil Twin copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below) and it gains the activated ability. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* If you copy a double-faced creature, Evil Twin will be a copy of the face that's up when Evil Twin enters the battlefield. Because Evil Twin is not a double-faced card, it won't be able to transform.
* If the chosen creature has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, X is considered to be zero.
* If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Evil Twin), then your Evil Twin enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
* If the chosen creature is a token, Evil Twin copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. Evil Twin is not a token.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Evil Twin enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
* If Evil Twin somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, Evil Twin can't become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that's already on the battlefield.
* You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Evil Twin enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.

* The enchanted creature's controller still chooses which player or planeswalker that creature attacks.
* If there are multiple combat phases in a turn, the enchanted creature must attack only in the first one in which it's able to.
* If, during its controller's declare attackers step, the enchanted creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under that player's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having the creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.

* Garruk Relentless's first ability is a state-triggered ability. It triggers once Garruk has two or fewer loyalty counters on him and it can't retrigger while that ability is on the stack.
* You don't add or remove loyalty counters from Garruk Relentless when he transforms into Garruk, the Veil-Cursed. In most cases, he'll have one or two loyalty counters on him.
* You can't activate a loyalty ability of Garruk Relentless and later that turn after he transforms activate a loyalty ability of Garruk, the Veil-Cursed.
* The second ability of Garruk, the Veil-Cursed doesn't target a creature. However, when that ability resolves, you must sacrifice a creature if you control one.
* The number of creature cards in your graveyard is counted when the third ability of Garruk, the Veil-Cursed resolves. Once the ability resolves, the bonus doesn't change if that number changes later in the turn.
* Only creatures you control when the third ability of Garruk, the Veil-Cursed resolves will receive the bonus. Creatures that enter the battlefield or that you gain control of later in the turn won't be affected.
* The planeswalker rules allow only an opponent to redirect noncombat damage that would be dealt to you to a planeswalker you control. For example, you can't cast [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) targeting yourself and choose to redirect that damage to a Garruk Relentless you control hoping to transform him.

Heretic's Punishment deals damage to that creature or player equal to the highest converted mana cost among those cards.


* If the targeted creature or player is an illegal target by the time the ability resolves, the entire ability will be countered. No cards will be put into your graveyard, and no damage will be dealt.

* If all three cards have a converted mana cost of 0, no damage will be dealt.
* If a split card is put into your graveyard this way, consider each cost individually. For example, if [Crime & Punishment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crime+%2F%2F+Punishment), a split card with converted mana costs of 2 and 5, is put into your graveyard as well as a land and a card with converted mana cost 6, 6 damage is dealt because 6 is greater than 5 and greater than 2.

* If a creature is equipped with a second Inquisitor's Flail, combat damage dealt by and dealt to that creature will be multiplied by four. A third Inquisitor's Flail would multiply the combat damage by eight, and so on.
* If you divide the combat damage dealt by the equipped creature, perhaps because the creature has trample or is dealing combat damage to multiple creatures, you'll divide the original amount and then double the results. For example, if a 5/5 creature with trample is blocked by a 2/2 creature, you can assign 2 damage to the blocker and 3 damage to the defending player. These amounts are then doubled to 4 and 6 damage, respectively. You can't double the damage to 10 first and then assign 2 to the creature and 8 to the player.

* Only creatures on the battlefield will be exiled. In other zones, they're "creature cards," not "creatures."
* A double-faced creature only has the name of the face that's up. For example, if Village Ironsmith is targeted by Sever the Bloodline, Ironfang wouldn't be exiled.
* If the targeted creature is an illegal target by the time Sever the Bloodline resolves, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. No creatures will be exiled.
* Unless a token is a copy of another creature or was explicitly given a name by the effect that created it, its name is the creature types it was given when it was created. For example, the Zombie tokens created by Army of the Damned and by Cellar Door are all named "Zombie."

After the exchange, Tree of Redemption would be a 2/9 creature (its toughness became 7, which was then modified by Spectral Flight) and your life total would be 15.
* If Tree of Redemption isn't on the battlefield when the ability resolves, the exchange can't happen and the ability will have no effect.

* The land card is counted when calculating the bonus, and it will be put into the graveyard with the other revealed cards.
* If the equipped creature is attacking a planeswalker in any game except a Two-Headed Giant game, the controller of the planeswalker is the defending player.
* If the equipped creature is attacking in a Two-Headed Giant game, the controller of the attacking creature chooses one of the two defending players, even if the creature is attacking a planeswalker.

* Only one +1/+1 counter will be removed, no matter how much damage is prevented.
* If Unbreathing Horde has no +1/+1 counters on it (but its toughness is raised above 0 by another effect), any damage dealt to it will still be prevented, even though no counter will be removed.
* If Unbreathing Horde enters the battlefield from a graveyard, it will count itself when determining how many +1/+1 counters it enters the battlefield with.

* If you control multiple Undead Alchemists, the multiple replacement abilities will have no added effect. Combat damage dealt to a player by a Zombie you control will be replaced only once with cards being put into that player's graveyard.
* Whenever a creature card is put into an opponent's graveyard from his or her library, the triggered ability of each Undead Alchemist you control will trigger. The first such ability to resolve will exile that creature card and create a Zombie token. Subsequent abilities won't exile the creature card, but each will create another Zombie token.
