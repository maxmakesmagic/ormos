*Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* Preorders Begin Tomorrow!
===========================================================


Preorders begin tomorrow, June 23, for the exciting new set *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate*, which includes 81 new cards and reprints from *Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* that bring in even more D&D flavor.


You'll also find new mechanics that bring the flavor of *[Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/commander-legends-battle-baldurs-gate)* to *MTG Arena*:


* **Specialize** – Pay mana and discard a color/land type of your choice to change your card to that new card with its effects (the change depends on which color you discarded).

* **Double team** – When a creature with double team attacks, if it's not a token, conjure a duplicate of the original into your hand, and then both cards lose double team.

* **Boon** – A new-to-*MTG Arena* mechanic, not exclusive to the *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* set, boon is a way to represent delayed triggers, similar to an emblem, but once they trigger, they disappear.
