No doubt you've already drooled over this Gruul-licious monster (in which case good for you -- drool is an appropriately Gruul reaction, especially while sort of grunt-growling approvingly): 


![Rumbling Slum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rumbling+Slum)
*Mmmmm... 5/5 for 4... "Drawback" hurt opponent and enable bloodthirst too... Rrrrrrrumbly slummmm... \*drool\**

The art for [Rumbling Slum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rumbling+Slum) depicts an animated slum-district, animated by the Izzet but adopted by the uncivilized Gruul. It's based on an image from the *Guildpact* style guide of a "debris elemental":




After Carl Critchlow's sketch was approved, he submitted this final art. But as you'll see, it didn't turn out to be final after all; the art team wanted it to be clearer that the big elemental was made of *buildings*, not just rubble. So more indications of architectural wreckage were added. Click the links below the image to see the changes.
