The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 25, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by ["This is always a great achievement."](#8)


What to Watch Today
===================


1. *Magic: The Gathering Arena* Developer Stream | [twitch.tv/magic](https://go.twitch.tv/magic) | 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. PT/8 p.m. UTC

You'll want to tune in for this one if you're in any way interested in the Closed Beta for *MTG Arena*. Info incoming!


Also, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
=====================================


1. [What to Expect at your FIRST Grand Prix! A Helpful Guide for New *Magic: The Gathering* Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQOmUnz9N0) | Magic the Amateuring | Meghan Wolff and Maria Bartholdi

We're neck-deep in prime Grand Prix season, which means you might be thinking about attending your first. Or second. Or eighth. Well, if it's the first, Meghan and Maria are here to calm your nerves (and they should be calm, Grand Prix are awesome).

1. [Jadine Klomparens Shares Stories from the Pro Tour](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/10/jadine-klomparens-shares-stories-pro-tour/) | Kitchen Table Magic | Sam Tang

The best interviews in the *Magic* community pick up this week with Jadine Klomparens, a pro-level tournament grinder and strong writer for StarCityGames.com.


1. [Commander VS: Coliseum of Randomness!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36063_Commander-VS-Coliseum-Of-Randomness.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

The first week of Randharmonicon begins. Or maybe it's Arena of the Arbitrary. Or the Coliseum of Randomness. Whatever it's called, it's pretty fun as the crew gets random commanders and decks to battle one another with.


1. [Approach the Coasts of *Ixalan* Limited](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/category/detail/204) | Hareruya English | Pierre Dagen

I've heard a number of people talking about having difficulty winning in *Ixalan* Draft (their names definitely don't rhyme with "Rake Basmussen"). Though there have been dozens of Limited articles written about the format, Dagen takes a slightly different and holistic approach to his advice. Maybe this one will help. Plus, there's a chart!


But if that's not enough for you (greedy!), [Kelvin Chew bequeaths unto us pick orders](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/kelvin-chew/ixalan-draft-pick-orders) today as well over on MTG Mint Card.


1. [Workshop Needs to Go](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/workshop-needs-to-go/) | ChannelFireball | Brian DeMars

After the Vintage Championships this past weekend, I would not be surprised if this became a rising sentiment among the Vintage community. There was already some grumbling in this direction before Workshop decks took five of the Top 8 slots (and the other three were Oath decks specifically designed to beat Workshop). DeMars goes into why it finally needs to happen.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

Okay, so here's what happened in this clip that took Twitter by storm late yesterday. Gaby—in her first foray into Vintage—gets paired against an [Oath of Druids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) deck, which lands its namesake card and a [Forbidden Orchard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Orchard) on the first turn. With no way to interact, Gaby just passes to see what horrible terror they would inflict on her next turn. But the only creature in their deck was the final card in their library—meaning they died due to decking on their draw step. Victory!

That translation seems accurate. Particularly the flavor text.

The conversation on what might be unbanned (if anything) after Pro Tour *Rivals of Ixalan* continues. My plea to unban specifically [Kjeldoran Outpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Outpost) and [Browse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Browse) has fallen on deaf ears, however.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard Drake Haven](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-10-24)

Okay, this is sweet. *Magic Online* player Kashmir went 5-0 in a Standard Constructed League where their primary win condition is [Drake Haven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drake+Haven). They even went as far as playing [Abandoned Sarcophagus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abandoned+Sarcophagus) to double-up on their cycling spells.


The deck has been around for a while, but it picked up some help in *Ixalan*. By now, everyone is aware [Search for Azcanta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Azcanta) is absurdly good, and this deck might be the best at filling up the graveyard to flip the Search sooner. And the density of spells in the deck makes it that much easier to hit when you activate [Azcanta, the Sunken Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azcanta%2C+the+Sunken+Ruin). [Settle the Wreckage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Settle+the+Wreckage) adds another instant-speed way to interact in a deck full of instant-speed action.


It's hard to tell if the deck is the real deal. It has little interaction against [Approach of the Second Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun), but a ton of game against decks like Temur Energy and Blue-Black Control that can't interact with [Drake Haven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drake+Haven) and don't kill particularly fast.


But still—[Drake Haven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drake+Haven)!
