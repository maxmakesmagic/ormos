It's time for another look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Our quiet period is almost at an end, and with the Pro Tour just over a week away, set for Brussels in Belgium, it will be the ultimate showcase for *Dragons of Tarkir*. Around the world of social media, numerous players have been posting travel plans, as their teammates converge on their chosen testing hubs ahead of all the action.



For the Top 25, the ultra-consistent Owen Turtenwald leads the way, as he has done for a while now. Four points doesn't sound like a lot, but even with a complete flameout from the No. 1, second place Lee Shi Tian of Hong Kong would still need a fine Day Two finish in Brussels to take the lead. And a total flameout from Turtenwald, while possible, is one of the more unlikely scenarios out there.



Third place currently belongs to Eric Froehlich, recently announced as the co-host of *Constructed Resources* alongside Marshall Sutcliffe. He has a couple of points in hand over Pro Tour champions Ivan Floch of the Slovak Republic, and Ari Lax of the United States. Canada's Shaun McLaren is next, just ahead of reigning World Champion Shahar Shenhar. Hall of Famer William Jensen sits at No. 8, with Samuel Black at No.9, and Yuuya Watanabe rounding out the Top 10.



By this time next week, these ten—and over 400 more hopefuls—will have (hopefully) chosen their decks for Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*. Join us for more a week from now, as we continue to keep an eye on the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
