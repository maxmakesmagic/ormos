The question that these cards posed is just so interesting to me: How much upside do you need to justify playing a land that effectively costs you a mana by entering the battlefield tapped?

The relative scales of playability of the different creature stats—3/3 trample vs. 1/1 regenerate, for example—are only one variable. You have to look at how many one-drops your deck plays, how much you have to gain by increasing the mana density of your deck (Would my red deck that works if I can play 26 lands but gets flooded too often all of a sudden *start* to work if some of those lands can turn into creatures, for example), and all kinds of other variables that previously simply did not exist in the deck construction process.
