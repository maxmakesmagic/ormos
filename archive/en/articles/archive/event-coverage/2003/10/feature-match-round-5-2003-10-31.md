![Feature Match: Jordan Berkowitz vs. Masashi Oiso](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/945.jpg)Both of these players made their mark in a big way on the Pro Tour last year. Masashi Oiso was a finalist at Pro Tour Yokohama, making him Rookie of the Year. Berkowitz had a Pro Tour Top 8, in addition to a Top 4 finish at U.S. Nationals. Even though both players have only had one season in the spotlight on the Pro Tour, their success thus far shows that their achievements were no fluke, and we can expect even more out of them in the future. 

### Game 1

![Oiso always seems to look stunned](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/946.jpg)Berkowitz's deck absolutely exploded on his first turn, as he played [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), two [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith)s and two [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key)s, then [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) set to three. Oiso had plenty of mana early as well, playing [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) with a [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) and [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) on turn two. [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) let Oiso draw eight extra cards, and Berkowitz played a second Chalice, this one on four. Oiso tapped six and put [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) into play, but waited to use it. A few turns later, Berkowitz played a third Chalice, this one set to six. Things slowed down significantly at this point, as both players would draw and simply end their turn, either discarding or playing more mana sources. After confirming the casting cost of [Phyrexian Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Colossus) with judges, Berkowitz played his fourth Chalice of the game, set to seven. After lots of consulting with judges, Berkowitz summoned [Karn, Silver Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn%2C+Silver+Golem), It made the Chalice set to four a creature, which caused it to die. This cleared the way for [Myr Incubator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Incubator), which created 21 1/1 tokens. Facing down defeat, Oiso activated [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) just in case, then cast a lethal [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) at Berkowitz for the win.

Oiso 1 - Berkowitz 0

### Game 2

![Berkowitz never fails to provide comedy gold](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/944.jpg)Berkowitz started with [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) and a Metalwoker, and played [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) on the following turn. [Sculpting Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sculpting+Steel) gave him a second [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), and he played [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) set to two. Oiso played two Keys and a Dynamo, and Berkowitz played [Myr Incubator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Incubator). Facing down the potential for a lethal amount of 1/1s, Oiso cast [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) looking for an answer. He went to his discard step, looking to see if Berkowitz would respond by activating his Incubator. Surprinsingly, he decided not to (Berkowitz would later explain he was afraid of [Stifle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle)), and played a second Incubator on his turn. Unfortunately for Berkowitz, Oiso found the answer he was looking for in [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). With plenty of mana floating, Oiso rebuilt to massive mana sources, then cast [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) to get and activate [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver). On Berkowitz's following end step where he had no permanents, Oiso cast a massive [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius), untapped and played [Phyrexian Processor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Processor) set to ten. He even had enough Keys and mana available to make two tokens right away, giving him the match.
