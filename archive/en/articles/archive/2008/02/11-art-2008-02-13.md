So just what *is* a +1/+1 counter, anyway? Sometimes, it's a flask of power, as on Burrenton Bombardier:

*[Burrenton Bombardier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Bombardier) art by Ron Spencer*
Those two blue bottles? Those are +1/+1 counters waiting to be applied -- mouse over the art to see them highlighted.


Okay, but what about some other ways that +1/+1 counters have been portrayed in the art? Consider the case of the Cytoplast creatures from *Dissension*. Here's the [Cytoplast Manipulator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cytoplast+Manipulator):

Once you mouse over the image, you'll see that each of her hands are enhanced with Cytoplasts. Two Hands = Two +1/+1 counters. By contrast, [Cytoplast Root-Kin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cytoplast+Root-Kin) has cytoplasts on both hands and both feetâ€”and has *four* +1/+1 counters!


[Dragon Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Blood) gives one +1/+1 counter at a time. Let's take a look at how Ron Spencer portrayed that in *Mirrodin*:

Of course, not all +1/+1 counters are portrayed so literally. Take, for example, the case of [Daily Regimen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daily+Regimen):


[![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/MOR/Daily_Regimen_640.jpg)](#image)
*[Daily Regimen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daily+Regimen) art by Warren Mahy*
That's just a giant doing exercises. But as long as we're here, mouse over the art to see the logical result of all that exercise. That giant should really consider switching arms.
