Welcome to Mana Fixing Week! This week we'll be talking about one of the important but more mundane parts of design. As I explained during [my first Nuts amp; Bolts column](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/21), the majority of design is about the minutiae. Yes, the splashy stuff sells the sets but making all the small pieces work together is actually the much more time consuming part of design. Mana fixing is definitely in the latter category. It's seldom the thing that draws attention to itself, but its execution has a great deal to do with whether environments (both Limited and Constructed) play well.

This, of course, begs the question: why are we even bothering to fix mana on a card by card basis? Shouldn't we fix it at a global level? This isn't the topic of today's column, so I'll just cut to the short answer: no, we shouldn't. **Magic**'s mana system is complex and has many moving pieces. It's doing valuable work; just leave it be. As they say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" (and yes, I am saying it ain't broke).
