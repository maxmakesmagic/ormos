D*uels of the Planeswalkers* is out! And to commemorate this momentous occasion, we've got two wallpapers!

But first! We'd like to introduce a special subfeature that's going to run *inside* **Magic Arcana** for the next three weeks! Take it away, Core Set Survivor!

**Core Set Survivor!**There are exactly sixteen cards that have been in every core set from *Alpha* to *Tenth Edition*. When ***Magic** 2010* comes out, that number will be eight. Over the next three weeks, we'll be counting them down in this special Arcana sub-feature, giving you an "IN" or "OUT" on one card a day. Step forward, [Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare).
