The October 16, 2017 Update
===========================



 Posted in **Daily Magic Update**

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 16, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by Gerry and Oliver T—the *T* stands for "Totally going to represent the US at the World *Magic* Cup."


Okay, that was a stretch.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Team Brazil is me, Carlos Romao and Lucas Berthoud! Not bad :)

Not bad at all! Brazil is looking like [one of the teams to beat](https://twitter.com/Top8Games/status/919666404147761152) come the World *Magic* Cup. It would be fitting, too—is any country having as good a year on the Pro Tour as Brazil?


1. > 
> Unreasonably excited to represent USA alongside Reid Duke!!!
> 
> 
>  — Gerry Thompson (@G3RRYT) [October 15, 2017](https://twitter.com/G3RRYT/status/919688801991217152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

And the USA is unreasonably excited to have Gerry T representing it alongside National Champion and professional 17-year-old Oliver Tomajko. The good old US of A looks to have a strong squad this year as well.


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [United States Nationals](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2017natus) | [twitch.tv/magic](https://go.twitch.tv/magic/videos/all)

Oooh, should I have put spoiler alert tags above? Did you not know about Gerry T or Oliver, um, also T? Sorry about that. Fortunately, there's still hours of *Magic* worth watching—even if you already know who eventually grabs the trophy.


If you're more the reading type, check out [Meghan Wolff's Top US Nationals moments piece from Sunday](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2017natus/us-nationals-top-moments-2017-10-15).


1. [StarCityGames.com Charlotte Open](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/141017_charlotte.html) | [twitch.tv/scgtour](https://go.twitch.tv/scgtour/videos/all)

There's also a heaping helping of Modern action if that's what you'd like to spend your Twitch watching hours as well. [The Top 8](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=28&start_date=10/13/2017&end_date=10/14/2017&start=1&finish=32&event_ID=47&city=Charlotte&state=NC&limit=50) was quite interesting, with a red-green land destruction deck making it, alongside [Green-Blue Merfolk](#10).


1. [*Ixalan* Standard and One-Set Blocks](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/ixalan-standard-and-one-set-blocks?src=wizards) | MTGGoldFish | SaffronOlive

Saffron dives into the world of Standard for a look at why *Kaladesh* block is still looming large over Standard and *Ixalan* is still finding its sea legs.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [2nd at 2017 World Championship and Ramunap Red in Standard](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/category/detail/200) | Hareruya English | Javier Dominguez

Dominguez came *thiiiiiis* close to being the *Magic* World Champion. He shares not only his experience at the tournament, but the mental repetitions and studious habits that got him there in the first place.


1. [Modern Bannings and You](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/rudybriksza-10162017-modern-bannings-and-you/) | Gathering Magic | Rudy Briksza

The intro alone is worth the price of admission, but Briksza also has some interesting takes on what should and should not be banned in Modern.


1. [Everything I Want from MTGO Data](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/10/everything-i-want-from-mtgo-data/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Rich Stein

You had to know that after another discussion about *Magic* *Online* data sprung up on Friday, Rich Stein would chime in. He has an interesting and different take, however, on the question of *Magic Online* data.


1. [*Magic*'s Reboots](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36009_Magics-Reboots.html) | StarCityGames.com | John Dale Beety

Beety looks at *Magic*'s story over the years and the various ways in which it has changed during that time. And also at that part where Jace is a jerk in flavor text.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Modern Green-Blue Merfolk](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=116674)

R&D doesn't believe Green-Blue Merfolk's time in Standard is here yet with just one set under their—belt? I don't know what Merfolk wear to secure their pants.


But in Modern? Apparently the time is now. Or at least this past weekend.


Alan Cummings finished in exactly 8th place with a Green-Blue Merfolk list that played eight green *Ixalan* Merfolk, plus a copy of [Kopala, Warden of Waves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kopala%2C+Warden+of+Waves). [Kumena's Speaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumena%27s+Speaker) is basically always a 2/2 for G in this deck (and often attacks as a 3/3 on turn two thanks to various lords), and [Merfolk Branchwalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Branchwalker) is kind of, almost, sort of like a [Silvergill Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvergill+Adept)—one of the deck's best cards.


The deck is real, but questions will still remain about it. For one, is it better than just Mono-Blue Merfolk? [Natural State](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+State) is a nice upgrade in the sideboard, certainly. Second, does the deck want [Collected Company](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) as well, or is four mana just too much?


Third, how sad is [Sygg, River Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sygg%2C+River+Guide) right now?
