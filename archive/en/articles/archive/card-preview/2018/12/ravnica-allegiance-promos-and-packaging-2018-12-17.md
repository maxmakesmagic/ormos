*Ravnica Allegiance* is coming! *Ravnica Allegiance* is coming! In about a month, that is. Which means it's about high time we showed you the promos that will be associated with the next big *Magic* entrance into Standard.


Also, since I'm going to be saying this with basically everything, let's get the disclaimer out of the way right now:


Supplies are limited—check with your local store for details. Some promotions are only available at participating stores that are members of the Wizards Play Network, so make sure you ask your [local store!](http://locator.wizards.com/)


Buy-A-Box
=========


It flies, it grows, *it drains vitality from those it touches*. Still, you might want to pick this one up along with a box of *Ravnica Allegiance*, as The Haunt of Hightower can grow to mammoth proportions, particularly in multiplayer. You can preorder a box from your local store and pick it up at the *Ravnica Allegiance* Prerelease January 19–20. Or you can pick up your box on or after the release date (January 25), and, if your store has any left, you'll get one of these thirsty Vampires on top of everything else.

Event Promos
============


Every season, we run a number of events, and many of those events come with unique promos. Let's check them out event by event. (And, yes, these all have non-promo versions in *Ravnica Allegiance*.)


Open House (January 12–13) kicks things off for *Ravnica Allegiance* promo season. Bring a friend, help teach curious gamers to play *Magic*, and you can walk away with this freewheeling promo.

Draft Weekend (January 26–27) is the weekend *Ravnica Allegiance* releases to the public, and a weekend of many drafts! Participate and ascend to new heights.

*Magic* League (starting January 28) is a fun way to grab a few packs and play smaller, quick Sealed games with friends at your local store or at home. If you complete at least ten matches in the *Magic* League, you can get this version of Gate Colossus.

Finally, Friday Night *Magic* events running during the *Ravnica Allegiance* Season (starting January 25) will have access to three different promos stores can distribute as they see fit. Explore FNM to pick up Growth Spiral, set fire to the battlefield and get a Light Up the Stage, or terrify your opponents and earn the right to Mortify them in style.


By the way, if you haven't already, check out the [*Ravnica Allegiance* mechanics article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/ravnica-allegiance-mechanics-2018-12-17) for information on just what spectacle entails.

Ravnica Weekend
===============


To celebrate all things Ravnica, local stores will be hosting Ravnica Weekend February 16–17. Players can play in a variety of events and, just for participating, pick up one of these premium foil guild-aligned basic lands.

Additionally, stores can hold events on Ravnica Weekend that are more competitive (much like the Store Championships of old) where participants can pick up this new version of Lavinia.
