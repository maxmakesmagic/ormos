In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).

### Artist Information


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpbar11/artist_avon.jpg)**John Avon**
  
 John Avon is an Illustrator living in the United Kingdom and has been working professionally since 1983. He has illustrated many hundreds of book covers for well-known authors in many areas from Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror to History and Psychology. He has also worked on National Advertising Campaigns, CD covers, Game, Toy and TV Development.



**Magic: The Gathering** has been a key element in his career and since *Mirage*, his artwork has been featured in almost every expansion of the game. Primarily, John works on environments, some very strange settings and the odd bizarre creature! He loves working for **Magic** as it gives him the freedom to constantly re-invent exciting worlds and stretch imagination to the limit. 


 For over a decade all his work has been digital, and John is a keen fan of using technology to its fullest potential. This summer his work will appear in the UK’s “Advanced Photoshop Magazine.” However his original roots are in traditional oil painting. He's currently accepting commissions on canvas as he returns to a classical approach. His intention is to move into the gallery fine art world and is working on an extensive personal project involving his musical and spiritual interests.
