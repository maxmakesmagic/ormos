While 11th-ranked Yuuya Watanabe is considered to be one of the better players to come out of Japan in the last decade, he's still had less Pro Tour Top 8s that you'd think, getting his third here this weekend. Someone else who's been long overdue for a Pro Tour Top 8 is Ari Lax. Lax has a slew of Grand Prix Top 8s under his belt including a win at Toronto last year, but until today, the big Sunday Pro Tour stage has evaded him.



 Lax has already defeated Watanabe once this weekend, beating him 2-1 during a *Khans of Tarkir* draft in Round 10. This time he'd be pitching his Abzan midrange deck against Watanabe's Jeskai Wins deck.





*While Ari Lax is looking to make his first long-overdue Pro Tour Top 8 a memorable one, 11th-ranked Yuuya Watanabe was hoping his third Top 8 would lead to his first win.*
