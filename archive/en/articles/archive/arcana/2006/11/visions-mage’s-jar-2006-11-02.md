[Magus of the Jar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Jar) holds an artifact so powerful that it was banned in *Urza Block* and Legacy, and remains restricted in Vintage. Why is it so powerful? Because it can hold within it the thoughts of even the mightiest of mages.


Take a look at the art of [Memory Jar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Jar). In it, the mystic jar has smashed to pieces, and its former owner’s memories spill out.

The art of [Memory Jar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Jar) is meant to depict the stored memories of Urza himself. You might recognize older, bearded Urza and a younger Urza (see the art of [Urza’s Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%E2%80%99s+Armor)) among the visions. Note also the great wizards’ school, the [Tolarian Academy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Academy) (upper right), shown at a time before it is destroyed.
