With a whole new 350-card set to look at, we're quickly turning "Sketches" sites to *Onslaught*. The first installment will cover the card Mark debuted [yesterday](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mr37), [Snapping Thragg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Thragg) by Iain McCaig.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Location: Skirk Ridge  
 Action: multi-headed mountain beast. Some of his bonespurs spit flames."

One of the defining characteristics of the beasts in *Onslaught* is their bonespurs, horn-like growths that spring from these creatures.

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Iain. His sketches have a quick, rough feel.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today. Or, rather, as you'll know it at the Prerelease!
