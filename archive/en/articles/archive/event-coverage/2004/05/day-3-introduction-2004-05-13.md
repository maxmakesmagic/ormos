![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi04/day3.jpg)E3 is proving to be quite a spectacle--lights, sounds, scantily-clad ladies tossing T-shirts and demo disks to drooling mobs of gamers, giant screens previewing the latest and greatest fighting and role-playing and RTS games, and reporters and photographers taking it all in. Here in Magic-land, Bob Maher is putting on a spectacle of his own, continuing to run the table in every format.


The Great One is now a perfect [10-0](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgevent/mi04/stand10), thanks in large part to his amazing Eighth Edition Rochester Draft deck that featured [Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin), [Thieving Magpie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Magpie), and lots of other goodies. (A little of his success is owed to Brian Kibler's horrific misclick in Round 9- see the [Feature Match](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgevent/mi04/fm7) coverage for the grisly details.)


After a long break (during which Osyp Lebedowicz and Justin Gary were interviewed for Playboy TV… no jokes… my oh my… you'll probably be hearing more about this at a later time…), the formats switched gears to *Mirrodin* block constructed. Some brave souls, including the Japanese players, decided to run Ravager Affinity right into the sea of hate. But most players opted for [Arc-Slogger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger) and [Pulse of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Forge). The mirror match technology--used by Maher in his 10th straight win, over Gary Wise--is simply more gigantic creatures, including [Megatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megatog) and [Vulshok War Boar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+War+Boar).


Now if we can just get Bob to do something about that [card he submitted](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgevent/mi04/feat5)


Tomorrow: More MBC, the wacky world of Online Extended, and who will Bob be facing in the Finals? Plus, a walk around the madhouse that is E3... Be here!
