*Shadows over Innistrad* previews are in full effect, as this site as well as many other outlets worldwide are piecing together the entirety of the brand-new set.


Looking to play with *Shadows over Innistrad*? [Starting April 2](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/shadows-over-innistrad), you'll have that opportunity at your local game store with Prereleases, along with ample opportunities to experience the new Standard following that. Read on for a quick rundown on ways to unravel what the new set is all about.


Prereleases
===========


Prereleases offer players worldwide a chance to play with the new cards before they are officially released. ***Shadows over Innistrad* Prereleases take place April 2 and 3**, and it'll be your first opportunity to open up boosters filled with brand-new *Magic* goodness, as you'll receive a Prerelease pack with six boosters of *Shadows over Innistrad* and will be able to build a 40-card sealed deck out of the contents of those packs (along with basic lands). Need help building a deck? Not a problem! Ask your fellow players or helpers at the store, and they will be able to assist you.


Gavin Verhey will have a complete rundown on what the Prerelease experience is like on March 28 here on this very website. That said, planning ahead is highly encouraged. Prereleases are very, *very* popular events, featuring players ranging from longtime fans to brand-new ones. If you would like to attend, contact your local store today to ask about how you can secure your spot in a *Shadows over Innistrad* Prerelease.


Launch Weekend
==============


Following the Prerelease is Launch Weekend, a weekend that, well, celebrates the launch of the new set. *Shadows over Innistrad* will be for sale in stores starting April 8, and Launch Weekend events take place April 8 through 10.


These events, which take place at hobby stores worldwide, have a variety of formats, so check with your local store to see what their offerings will be. Some stores run Standard tournaments as part of their Friday Night *Magic* offerings and combine the excitement of Launch Weekend with their weekly FNM. Others run Booster Draft events. Others run midnight celebrations, where players have an opportunity to get the new set as soon as the clock strikes midnight on April 8, and will sanction Booster Draft events as soon as it's officially April 8 in their store. There are a ton of possibilities for the new player and the veteran alike, so check with your local store to see what all there is for you during Launch Weekend!


Friday Night *Magic*
====================


Got a sick combo you want to explore? Looking for a place to try out those new copies of Arlinn Kord, Avacyn, and more that you got during the Prerelease and Launch Weekend? Or are you just looking to draft, draft, and draft? Friday Night *Magic* is your opportunity to ignite your weekend with a *Shadows over Innistrad* flare, as they are one of the highlight days to play *Magic* at your local store. Friday Night *Magic* can be a wide variety of formats, but Standard and Booster Draft are among the most common that you'll see at your local store on a Friday.


Standard also marks the beginning of something new, as the release of *Shadows over Innistrad* brings with it a rotation, since *Khans of Tarkir* and *Fate Reforged* leave the Standard format on April 8. This means the landscape for Standard will be brand new, and ripe for experimentation, so explore your favorite strategies and find what works for you each week.


Bring your latest decks and Draft strategies to Friday Night *Magic* starting April 8—part of Launch Weekend—and unravel the madness of *Shadows over Innistrad* for weeks!


Game Day
========


If Friday Night *Magic* is your opportunity to explore the new set through a variety of formats, Game Day is your chance to wade into the competitive waters of Standard Constructed one week after seeing Standard at its height during Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*.


Game Day is one of your first steps into a competitive store-level tournament, as the winner of Game Day will receive a really, really cool champion's playmat, and the Top 8 players get sweet full-art event-exclusive promo cards. Participants also get a full-art promo (while supplies last), so everyone has the opportunity to receive something for playing in Game Day.

These are all your in-store opportunities to experience *Shadows over Innistrad*. It all starts April 2 and continues every week thereafter. Find a local store near you, check to see what events they're running and when, and unlock the secrets of the new set week after week.
