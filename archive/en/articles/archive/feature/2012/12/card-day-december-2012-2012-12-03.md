![Tsabo Tavoc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tsabo+Tavoc)**[Tsabo Tavoc](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo+Tavoc)** – *Invasion* rare. In the storyline, [Tsabo Tavoc](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo+Tavoc) gets killed by [Gerrard Capashen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=26793). That doesn't work perfectly in card form, because [Tsabo Tavoc](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo+Tavoc) is pretty good at fighting other Legendary Creatures. 
 


![111202](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=111202)**[Wrecking Ball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=111202)** – *Dissension* common. The name "[Wrecking Ball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=111202)" is actually a pun. Because instead of being one of those giant metal balls that knocks down buildings, it's the kind of "ball" you have in a ballroom. But because it's Rakdos, the ballroom ends up getting knocked down anyway. 
 


![107437](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=107437)**[Avatar of Discord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=107437)** – *Dissension* rare. Note that [Avatar of Discord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avatar+of+Discord) requires that its caster actually have two cards to discard. If it said "When [Avatar of Discord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avatar+of+Discord) enters the battlefield, discard two cards," then you could get away with casting it as the last card in your hand. But you can't! 
 


![Rix Maadi Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rix+Maadi+Guildmage)**[Rix Maadi Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rix+Maadi+Guildmage)** – *Return to Ravnica* uncommon. The "Rix Maadi" in the name of [Rix Maadi Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rix+Maadi+Guildmage) means that the guildmage is associated with [Rix Maadi, Dungeon Palace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rix+Maadi%2C+Dungeon+Palace), the *Dissension* card that represents the Rakdos guild hall. 
 


![Rakdos, Lord of Riots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rakdos%2C+Lord+of+Riots)**[Rakdos, Lord of Riots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%2C+Lord+of+Riots)** – *Return to Ravnica* mythic rare. The Rakdos Cult is made up of Rings, which are informal groups of people who pay tribute to Rakdos. But the only real organization is that Rakdos is the undisputed leader. 
 


![Phantom General](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phantom+General)**[Phantom General](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+General)** – *Return to Ravnica* uncommon. From a flavor standpoint, there's no difference between a creature represented by a token and a creature represented by a card. But for the purposes of [Phantom General](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+General), ghosts mean tokens. Just for this one card, though! 
 


![Skyline Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Skyline+Predator)**[Skyline Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyline+Predator)** – *Return to Ravnica* uncommon. You can tell the difference between a drake and a dragon in **Magic** art by counting the legs. Dragons have four legs (and wings), while drakes are missing the front pair. Of course, if it's a creature card, you also have the option of looking at the type line. 
 


![Downsize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Downsize)**[Downsize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Downsize)** – *Return to Ravnica* common. The creature being shrunk in [Downsize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Downsize) looks like it could be an Indrik, as seen in *Dissension* as [Indrik Stomphowler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=107377) and in *Return to Ravnica* as [Towering Indrik](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Towering+Indrik). 
 


![Chromatic Lantern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chromatic+Lantern)**[Chromatic Lantern](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Lantern)** – *Return to Ravnica* rare. The power of the [Chromatic Lantern](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Lantern) is shown in its art: it appears to be casting off multiple colors of light at once. In fact, what it's actually casting off is mana! And also regular light, because you never know when you'll want a good lantern. 
 


![Avenging Arrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Avenging+Arrow)**[Avenging Arrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenging+Arrow)** – *Return to Ravnica* common. Not all cards in *Return to Ravnica* belong clearly to one guild or another. Just because *this* [Avenging Arrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenging+Arrow) came from a Selesnya archer doesn't mean there couldn't be others that were from the Azorius. They also like punishing wrongdoers, after all!
