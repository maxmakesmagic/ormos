 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






[Two years ago](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/how-trivial-2018-10-22), I did a trivia column for *Magic*'s 25th anniversary. The column was very popular, so I've decided to do another one. Last time I did a trivia question per year of *Magic*, plus five bonus questions, for a total of 30 questions. I'm going to again ask 30 questions, but this time, ones about 30 different projects that I led or co-led.


Record your answers as you read through and then compare them with my answers below.

**Answer to Question #1 about *Tempest* – b. [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)**


[Coercion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coercion) first appeared in *Visions*, [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) first appeared in *Mirage*, and [Wind Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wind+Drake) first appeared in *Portal*. [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) was designed as "[Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) your team." Trample was added to give it a little more oomph. The card appeared in the file pretty early in design and never left. I think development changed it from a 4GG spell to a 3GGG spell, but other than that left it as it was designed. [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) has gone on to be printed in a bunch of other *Magic* sets and products.


**Answer to Question #2 about *Vanguard* – a. 38 & 12**


These were all actual numbers. [Gix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gix) increased your life total by 18, and both [Ashnod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashnod) and [Takara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takara) reduced it by 8. [Eladamri](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eladamri) increased your life total by 15, and both [Hanna](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanna) and [Titania](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titania) reduced it by 5. [Sidar Kondo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidar+Kondo) and [Orim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim) increased your life total by 12, and [Squee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squee), [Tawnos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tawnos), and [Lyna](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lyna) all reduced your life by 4. Finally, Urza raised your life total by 10, and [Sisay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sisay) and [Volrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath) reduced it by 3.


**Answer to Question #3 about *Unglued* – a. B.F.M.**


B.F.M. is wearing earrings. One is [Polar Kraken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polar+Kraken) from *Ice Age*, and the other is [Phyrexian Dreadnought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought) from *Mirage*. They were chosen because, at the time, they were the biggest creatures in *Magic* (11/11 and 12/12, respectively), and we wanted to show off how big the 99/99 B.F.M was. [Censor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Censor)ship uses art that was cropped from the art used on [Keeper of the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeper+of+the+Mind) from *Exodus*. [Clambassadors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clambassadors)'s art and flavor text are making fun of the card [Reparations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reparations) from *Mirage*. [Lexivore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lexivore)'s flavor text is making fun of a flavor text convention we used a lot at the time.


**Answer to Question #4 about *Urza's Destiny* – d. [Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder)**


[Covetous Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covetous+Dragon) was part of a three-card creature cycle (along with [Emperor Crocodile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emperor+Crocodile) and [Tethered Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tethered+Griffin)) that you had to sacrifice if you didn't have a particular permanent type. The cycle referenced all the non-land permanent types that existed at the time. [Eradicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eradicate) was part of a five-card cycle (along with [Scour](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scour), [Quash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quash), [Sowing Salt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sowing+Salt), and [Splinter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter)) that got rid of a certain card type and then let you search that player's hand, graveyard, and library for all copies of the card. [Voice of Duty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Duty) was part of a four-card cycle of 2/2 white Angels with protection from each of the four other colors. Two cards from the cycle ([Voice of Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Grace) and [Voice of Law](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Law)) appeared in *Urza's Saga*, while [Voice of Duty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Duty) and [Voice of Reason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Reason) appeared in *Urza's Destiny*. [Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder) used a mechanic from the set, what we referred to in R&D as "cycling from play," but it wasn't cycled out in any way, appearing on black, green, and artifact cards ([Brass Secretary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brass+Secretary), [Heart Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+Warden), [Marker Beetles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marker+Beetles), [Plague Dogs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Dogs), and [Slinking Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slinking+Skirge)).


**Answer to Question #5 about *Odyssey* – a. [Flame Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Burst)**



![](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/Upsidedown-odyssey_cardart.jpg)[Flame Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Burst) | Art by: [Ron Spencer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5b%22Ron+Spencer%22%5d)
Here's the art as it was turned in for the card Aven Smokereaver, a 2/3 flying blue aven with protection from red. Although the aven wasn't actually being harmed by the blast of red magic, it seemed a lot of us in the office liked that it was about to be, so we decided to move it to a red direct spell instead. We flipped it upside down to focus a little more on the blast and a little less on the creature.


**Answer to Question #6 about *Mirrodin* – a. Gnome**


The Gnome creature type first appeared on a red creature card named [Quarum Trench Gnomes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quarum+Trench+Gnomes) in *Legends*. Gnomes would go on to become an artifact creature type. The first artifact Gnome was [Ersatz Gnomes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ersatz+Gnomes) in *Mirage*, although it didn't have the creature type yet as artifact creatures didn't have creature types back then. The first artifact Gnome to be printed with the Gnome creature type was [Patchwork Gnomes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patchwork+Gnomes) in *Odyssey*. (I was one of the people who pushed hard to make it so that all artifact creatures got a creature type.)


**Answer to Question #7 about *Fifth Dawn* – a. Aaron Forsythe**


Aaron was hired originally to run the *Magic* website. We put him on the *Fifth Dawn* design team so that he could write an article about what it was like to be on a *Magic* design team. Aaron did such a great job, including designing scry and sunburst for the set, that we ended up hiring him in R&D. Bill Rose, Erik Lauer, and Mark Gottlieb were all hired directly into R&D, although Mark Gottlieb started as an editor.


**Answer to Question #8 about *Unhinged* – c. Disrobing Scepter**


![Disrobing Scepter](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/Disrobing-Scepter_card.png)


I used to have a humor piece in *The Duelist* called "Extra Pulled" where I showed cards that "didn't make it." One of the cards I had there was a card called Disrobing Scepter which acted like [Disrupting Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupting+Scepter), but the opponent had the option to remove a piece of clothing rather than discard a card. As a joke, I put the card in an *Unglued* file for a playtest with the brand team. I then took it out and put it in the secret message as one of the cards we couldn't print. I then put it in *Unhinged* for a playtest as it seemed like it being in the set and then being removed was tradition. It was then put in *Unhinged*'s secret message stating that it was removed again.


Celery Stalker was an actual card in *Unglued 2*, the *Un-* set that never got made. One of the major themes of the set was animated vegetables that gave poison counters to players when they dealt combat damage. Chump-Blocking Orphan and Look at Me, I'm Accounts Receivable were just in-jokes from the design.


**Answer to Question #9 about *Ravnica: City of Guilds* – b. Convoke**


Convoke was created by Richard Garfield for the Boros. I really liked the mechanic, but it felt like a better fit for Selesnya, so I moved it from red-white to green-white.


**Answer to Question #10 about *Future Sight* – d. 81**


For each set in *Time Spiral* block, we had a timeshifted sheet, that is a series of cards that played into the past, alternate present, or future theme of the set, with a frame different from the rest of the pack. *Time Spiral* had 121 timeshifted cards using the original card frame that had a single slot in the booster pack. *Planar Chaos* had 45 timeshifted cards using an alternate card frame that each had a single slot in the booster pack. *Future Sight* had 81 timeshifted cards using a "future" frame that was mixed in with the other cards, meaning it did not get a designated slot per pack like the previous two sets.


**Answer to Question #11 about *Shadowmoor* – b. Faerie**


Faeries were the one creature type of the tribes *Lorwyn* block mechanically cared about to stay in the same colors in *Shadowmoor*, blue and black. (There were a couple hybrid white-blue Faeries, but all of them fit in a blue-black Faerie deck.) Elves were in black and green in *Lorwyn* block and changed to green and white in *Shadowmoor* block. Goblins were black and red in *Lorwyn* block and changed to red and green in *Shadowmoor* block. Merfolk were white and blue in *Lorwyn* block and changed to blue and black in *Shadowmoor* block. There were a number of hybrid cards in *Shadowmoor* that were the *Lorwyn* color combinations for each tribe, but all the monocolor cards followed the color combinations I've laid out.


**Answer to Question #12 about *Eventide* – d. 11**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Figure+of+Destiny)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny)
The card with eleven hybrid mana symbols is [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny).


**Answer to Question #13 about *Zendikar* – c. *Tempest***


In the *Tempest* story, Rath is an artificial plane created by the Phyrexians as part of their plan to invade Dominaria. Creatures from other planes were pulled against their will into Rath, including the Kor from Zendikar. We have yet to see the home plane of any of the other Rathi races (the Vec, the Dal, the Soltari, the Thalakos, and the Dauthi).


**Answer to Question #14 about *Scars of Mirrodin* – a. 16% (40 cards)**


*Scars of Mirrodin* was meant as a return to Mirrodin where the Phyrexian threat was being noticed, but not yet a huge problem. That changed quickly in *Mirrodin Besieged* when the Phyrexian mix was up to 50% as the war for the fate of Mirrodin occurred. Then after they won, the Phyrexian mix went up to 90% in *New Phyrexia*.


**Answer to Question #15 about *Innistrad* – a. *Duel Masters* Trading Card Game**


*Duel Masters* is a trading card game Wizards makes exclusively for the Japanese market. *Duel Masters* tends to push mechanical boundaries a lot more than *Magic* (it has used *Un-* sets as inspiration numerous times). Tom LaPille had worked on a *Duel Masters* set right before being on the *Innistrad* design team, and when we were looking for a solution to making cool Werewolves, he suggested the double-faced technology that the *Duel Masters* team was using. I was skeptical at first, but after one playtest, I was all aboard.


**Answer to Question #16 about *Dark Ascension* – d. Black-blue-red**


*Dark Ascension* has two white-blue gold cards ([Drogskol Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drogskol+Captain) and [Drogskol Reaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drogskol+Reaver)), two black-red gold cards ([Falkenrath Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Aristocrat) and [Stromkirk Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Captain)), and a green card with a blue flashback cost ([Tracker's Instincts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tracker%27s+Instincts)). The set has no three-color cards or cards optimized using three colors.


**Answer to Question #17 about *Gatecrash* – b. Basic lands**


Instead of basic lands, each of the *Gatecrash* boosters had a guildgate.


**Answer to Question #18 about *Theros* – d. Scry**


*Theros* has 29 cards with scry (three white, ten blue, one black, five red, one green, one white-blue, one black-green, one artifact, and five lands) plus one card that cares mechanically about scrying (in red). It has eighteen cards with heroic (five white, three blue, two black, three red, three green, one white-blue, and one red-white), and sixteen cards of both devotion (two white, two blue, five black, two red, four green, and one land) and monstrosity (one white, two blue, two black, four red, four green, one red-green, one green-white, and one artifact).


**Answer to Question #19 about *Khans of Tarkir* – b. Eye** 


The Jeskai (blue-red-white), being about cunning, is the eye of the dragon. The Abzan, being about endurance, (white-black-green) is the scale of the dragon. The Sultai (black-green-blue), being about ruthlessness, is the fang of the dragon. The Mardu (red-white-black), being about speed, is the wing of the dragon. The Temur (green-blue-red), being about savagery, is the claw of the dragon.


**Answer to Question #20 about *Battle for Zendikar* – c. 5** 


*Battle for Zendikar* had five dual lands ([Prairie Stream](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prairie+Stream), [Sunken Hollow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunken+Hollow), [Smoldering Marsh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smoldering+Marsh), [Cinder Glade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cinder+Glade), and [Canopy Vista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Vista)), which also appeared with new art and frames in *Zendikar Expeditions*.


**Answer to Question #21 about *Kaladesh* – a. Create** 


*Kaladesh* was the set to introduce create. Die premiered in *Magic 2012*, exile first showed up in *Magic 2010*, and fight appeared first in *Innistrad*.


**Answer to Question #22 about *Amonkhet* – d. Flood counter**


The *Amonkhet* punch card had "Embalmed" and "Exalted" reminders and -1/-1 and brick counters. While the set has one card that uses flood counters ([Bounty of the Luxa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bounty+of+the+Luxa)), it was not at a high enough volume to make the punch card.


**Answer to Question #23 about *Ixalan* – d. Vampire**


When Jenna Helland first pitched Ixalan, she sold it as a Meso-American-influenced world with Vampire conquistadors. When we put Ixalan on the schedule, I asked for the Creative team to turn it from a two-sided conflict into a three-sided conflict. They did so by adding Pirates. Dinosaurs came about as they fleshed out the world. I then chose to focus on them as a tribe. The merfolk got added when we realized we needed a fourth tribe.
