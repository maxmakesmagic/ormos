* See what’s coming in *MTG Arena’s* [State of the Game—*Innistrad: Crimson Vow*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-innistrad-crimson-vow-2021-11-04)

Midweek *Magic*: Phantom Quick Draft
====================================


Want to try out drafting in a chill environment without entry costs or time pressures? Try out this week's Phantom Quick Draft in [Midweek *Magic*](https://admin.magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/midweek-magic).


In this event, you get to draft *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* cards to see [what the Draft format is like](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/booster-draft) against bots who don't mind if you want to take your time to read every card multiple times before selecting one and passing on the pack, and won't slow you down if you're a fast picker.


Matches are played against real players once you've finished drafting and assembled your deck. You only draft once, but you can play as many games as you want with the deck you drafted, and since this is a Phantom draft, the cards you pick aren't added to your collection.


Standard Metagame Challenge: November 19–22
===========================================


Now that *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* has swept into the Standard game with a bloodthirsty flourish, it's time for the return of the Standard Metagame Challenge!

Enjoy The Gathering, November 24–28

The holidays are a time to relax and take part in gatherings that are fun and make you happy. And gatherings can happen in most any place—or any plane. In *MTG Arena*'s The Gathering, running November 24–28, you'll find a place for the kind of gathering we all enjoy—the *Magic* kind!


The Gathering is an All-Access Singleton event with no entry! Build a 60-card Standard deck—regardless of whether you have the cards in your collection—but with no more than one copy of the cards you choose. Play as much as you want until the event ends!
