While we have not finished sorting through the names you all submitted, I am happy to announce that Ron Spencer, the artist chosen by you to illustrate [Gazarsgo’s Plow], has turned in his three sketches. Today, you will have a chance to look at all three and select the one you feel best fits the card.


Also, just to keep you all in the loop, the development team has playtested the card and costed it at ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif). At this cost, the card is being played in our Future Future League and the developers believe it’s going to be a tournament-worthy card.


The deadline for today’s vote is midnight the night of September 11th. But enough of my blabbering, let’s get to the sketches, with notes from Ron:


### Sketch #1


![YMTC2 â€“ Sketch 1](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/articles/Hourglass1.jpg)*"This idea has the viewer level with the base of the hourglass, looking up. The root system of the upper sphere is visible through the glass. The background will be swirling darkness with a few stars. The orbs in the columns will be glowing. The forests depicted are Mirrodin's metallic forests."*


### Sketch #2


![YMTC2 â€“ Sketch 2](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/articles/Hourglass2.jpg)*"This sketch puts the viewer slightly higher than the midpoint of the hourglass. The churning debris is visible as it is being sucked down through the opening to fall over the lower level. This idea has a more cosmic feel for the background, with the columns being made up of suns and stars. The forests depicted are again Mirrodin's metallic forests."*


### Sketch #3


![YMTC2 â€“ Sketch 3](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/articles/Hourglass3.jpg)*"This is the most dynamic angle of the three. We're looking down from an angle above the upper sphere. The forests shown are normal non-metal Earth-type trees. The background is space with suns and moons forming vague columns."*


As you can see, this vote is a very subtle one. I’m curious to see which version you choose. For the next step, we'll have the names you submitted whittled down to ten. After that, only flavor text remains!


As always, have fun!


Mark Rosewater
