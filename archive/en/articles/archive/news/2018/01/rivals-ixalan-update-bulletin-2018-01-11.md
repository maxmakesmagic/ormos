My update bulletins have so far been a tour of the exciting locales related to the recent set, so you'd expect this set's update bulletin to come to you live from the golden city of Orazca. That would be a very logical assumption, but have you *seen* the city lately? It's overrun by fighting Pirates, smiting Vampires, biting Dinosaurs, and lightning Merfolk. Stormin' Merfolk? I'll keep well out of that mess, thank you very much.


This update bulletin includes the changes for *Rivals of Ixalan*, and . . . well . . . *Unstable*. Yes, *Unstable* wiggled its weird ways into my black-bordered reality and caused some black-bordered rules and Oracle updates. You can find the [Comprehensive Rules here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) on our website, and Oracle text updated in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/).


As part of the *Unstable* Oracle update, every *Unglued* and *Unhinged* card (more or less) received the errata that it would have received over the years to keep up with modern templating. I'm not going to list every one of those cards and discuss the changes exhaustively, but if you have any questions about the new text, you can ask m—wait, no, don't ask me. Ask Mark Rosewater.


No, seriously, stop asking me.


*Nooooooo*.


There goes my inbox.


Oh well, let's get on with black-bordered world!
