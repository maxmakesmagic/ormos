In the *Mirrodin* block storyline, [Memnarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch) created the terrifying [leveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=leveler)s to help cull the populations of living beings. Major characters such as [Glissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa), [Raksha](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=books/magic/cpraksha) and [Slobad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slobad) all came face-to-face with the levelers at least once.

In fact, if you hyper-zoom on Carl Critchlow's art of the *Mirrodin* card **[Leveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leveler)**, you can actually see one of those three legends right in the art.

![Leveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Leveler)
No, you'll have to zoom in more than that.

  
  
[Leveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Leveler)


Give up? Keep zooming...

  
  
[Leveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Leveler)


It's [Slobad, Goblin Tinkerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slobad%2C+Goblin+Tinkerer), the character who [wakes up Bosh](/en/articles/archive/slobads-tinkering-project-2004-01-28). Slobad runs into Memnarch's levelers in the [*Mirrodin* block novels](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=books/magic/mirrodinworld).


Note that the red goo seen through the leveler's dome (check the middle picture above) is the shredded organic material of creatures it has already leveled. Yow.
