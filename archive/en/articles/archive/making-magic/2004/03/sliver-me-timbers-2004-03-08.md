 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






Welcome to Sliver Week! After several weeks of messing around, I felt its time to roll up my sleeves and give you a down and dirty design column. As its Sliver Week, my topic seemed pretty straight-forward. So, how did slivers come to be? Who designed them? How did they change? What unique challenges did they present? All that and more as I bring you:

### “Slivers: The Untold Story”.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/mtgcom_feature_6_pic1.jpg)Slivers began their life in a **Magic** expansion called “Astral Ways”. Now, I don't expect you to recognize this name because it wasn't a set designed at Wizards of the Coast. It was a set designed by a **Magic** player in his spare time who felt that he could make a cool set. The important part of the story is the name of the player who designed the set. His name was Mike Elliott. 

For those of you that ever pay attention when I talk about designers, this name should ring a bell. Mike Elliott is one of the most prolific **Magic** designers in the history of the game. Mike and I have an ongoing argument about what person has designed the most **Magic** cards to see print. We're both sure it's one of us, but at that point we start deviating in our answer. (The real answer is me if you're curious, although keep in mind that I have the luxury of writing this column. That said, it's me.) Nonetheless, Mike's influence on the design of the game is tremendous. At one point though, Mike was just another **Magic** player who thought it would be cool to design his own set. 

### In the Beginning

The crux of “Astral Ways” was a world split into two. There was the normal world and then a parallel astral world. The only connection between these two worlds was a doorway. A celestial doorway, if you will. The villain of the story wanted to open the door. I'm not sure if he wanted to let the astral creatures into our world or let our world invade the astral world. Either way, he wanted to open the door. In his way was the hero, a character known as the Controller. In the story, the Controller gets betrayed by a sexy but devious woman and the doorway gets open. The Controller manages to shut the door but in doing so gets sliced into many tiny fragments. These fragments become known as slivers.

The mechanical inspiration for slivers was the card Plague Rat. Mike realized that the card's mechanic was intriguing and very expandable. Imagine, he thought, an entire race of [Plague Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Rats). Thus was born the slivers. Incidentally, that name was coined by Mike in “Astral Ways” and never changed throughout design and development. This was not true of the one other mechanic to make it from “Astral Ways” to *Tempest*. The astral ability would later be renamed shadow.

Mike knew that he needed a cycle of common slivers for two reasons. One, he needed the slivers to show up in great enough number that their synergistic (or "linear") ability would come up in limited play. Two, Mike realized very early the potency of the mechanic and felt the need to divvy it up to all five colors to allow him to set them at an aggressive power level. If the slivers had all been green, for example, the entire mechanic would have to been costed much more conservatively.

Mike then made a number of flavorful rares that represented some of the larger, and more important, pieces of the Controller. Here for the first time are all the slivers as they first appeared: (note that I've added the rarity after the name) 

**White Sliver** (common)

As you can see, the mechanic crux of the common sliver cycle was alive and well in “Astral Ways”. But as you will see, there were a few changes to be made along the way.

### *Tempest* in a Teapot

A year or so later, Mike met Joel Mick, then Lead **Magic** Designer at a game convention in his hometown of Phoenix. The two hit it off and Joel ended up recommending Mike for a job in R&D. This was the same R&D new hire push that led to Bill Rose, William Jockusch and myself being hired. 

About a year after that I had talked my way into being given a chance to demonstrate my design skills. The project was a little expansion named *Tempest*. Joel let me pick my team. Mike and I had bonded a great deal in the previous year over a mutual desire to find a girlfriend. (I'd like to note that Mike and I are both happily married now with five children between us.) Mike had expressed interest in doing some design and hey, he even had an expansion he'd designed before coming to the company.

The slivers were a very early hit among the design team. But the needed a little bit of tweaking.

**White Common Sliver** – R&D decided to remove banding from the game. The first set to have it go AWOL was going to be *Tempest*. This meant the white sliver had to change. We wanted a simple keyword. After much searching we decided to steal first strike from the red sliver.

**Blue Common Sliver** – The only sliver to remain untouched throughout the design and development process.

**Black Common Sliver** – The activation was raised from 1 to 2 after playtesting showed how powerful the ability was. In addition, we realized that the card didn't need its own regeneration as its sliver ability already granted it to itself.

**Red Common Sliver** – As first strike was stolen away, red ended up grabbing another keyword in its color: haste.

**Green Common Sliver** – Few creatures in the history of R&D created more discussion than the green common sliver. Many members of the design team liked the idea of a sliver granting +1/+1. Here were the different points of contention: 1) This card differed from every other sliver in that its ability stacked meaning that a second copy of the card had an effect. If all creatures have flying, for instance, what does it matter if they gain flying a second time? But +1/+1 always had an impact. 2) The card at ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) (and remember all the common slivers were 1/1 for 1C, with C representing any colored mana symbol) obsoleted [Grizzly Bears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears). After many lengthy discussions, we decided that we were willing to occasionally obsolete so-so cards. We acknowledged that [Grizzly Bears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears) was one of those cards and never looked back.

Once the commons were in pace, the design team decided that we wanted a cycle of uncommons. Here's our first pass at the uncommons: (and remember that this was going on simultaneously to us hashing out our common slivers).

**Uncommon White Sliver**   
 2WW  
 Summon Sliver   
 White   
 3/3   
 All Slivers gain “2: +0/+1 until end of turn.” 

**Uncommon Blue Sliver**   
 2UU  
 Summon Sliver   
 Blue   
 3/3   
 All Slivers gain "2, Sacrifice this Sliver: Draw a card." 

**Uncommon Black Sliver**   
 2BB  
 Summon Sliver   
 Black   
 3/3   
 All Slivers gain “2: +1/+0 until end of turn.” 

**Uncommon Red Sliver**   
 2RR  
 Summon Sliver   
 3/3   
 All Slivers are unaffected by summoning sickness. 

**Uncommon Green Sliver**   
 2GG  
 Summon Sliver   
 Green   
 3/3   
 All Slivers gain trample. 

Here's how the uncommons shook out:

**Overall** – One of the first changes to the uncommon slivers was changing them from 2CC 3/3 creatures to 2C 2/2 creatures. We knew we had a fast environment and wanted to make sure the sliver deck could keep up.

**White Uncommon Sliver** – This card never changed (other than abovementioned mana cost and power/toughness switch).

**Blue Uncommon Sliver** – This card also remained the same.

**Black Uncommon Sliver** – The ability of this card got moved to the uncommon red sliver. This made us have to create a new ability for black. Discard seemed like an obvious choice.

**Red Uncommon Sliver** – Red lost haste to its common brethren, so it stole the power-pumping ability from black. After all, firebreathing is red.

**Green Uncommon Sliver** – With the +1/+1 ability at common, uncommon green simply stole the trample ability.

At the same time we were creating the uncommon cycle, we made one last sliver.

Artifact Sliver   
 1   
 Artifact Creature   
 Artifact   
 1/1 

The idea behind this card was that the artifact version (aka the fake one) only received the sliver abilities, it didn't grant any.

Most importantly, we created a mechanical identity for the slivers. (For more on card flavor see Rei Nakasawa's article on the flavor of slivers.) Slivers were all creatures that had an ability that enhanced all other slivers in play. This definition is the major reason most of the rare cards from “Astral Ways” never saw print.

### Invading the *Stronghold*

After carefully balancing the sliver mechanic in *Tempest*, we found ourselves with a problem. How could we print more slivers without creating the crazy mono-colored deck? And then the answer came to us… multi-colored slivers. 

Here is the team's first pass on the slivers in *Stronghold*: 

**Mind of the Controller**   
 BUGRW   
 Summon Legend   
 Gold   
 7/7   
 Trample   
 Counts as a Sliver   
 3: Put a Sliver token into play. Treat this creature as a 1/1 colorless creature. 

**Blue-white Sliver**
  
 WU   
 Summon Sliver   
 Gold   
 2/2   
 Slivers cannot be the target of spells or abilities. 

**Red-green Sliver**   
 RG   
 Summon Sliver   
 Gold   
 2/2   
 Whenever any Sliver creature is blocked, it gets +1/+1 for each creature blocking it. 

**White-green Sliver**   
 WG   
 Summon Sliver   
 Gold   
 2/2   
 Each Sliver gains "Sacrifice this Sliver: Gain 3 life." 

**Black-red Sliver**   
 BR   
 Summon Sliver   
 Gold   
 Each Sliver gains "1, Sacrifice this Sliver: This Sliver deals 2 damage to target creature or player." 

**Black-blue Sliver**   
 UB   
 Summon Sliver   
 Gold   
 2/2   
 Each Sliver gains "Pay 2 life: Return this Sliver to owner's hand." 

As you can see, the gold slivers didn't change all that much. [Sliver Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen) lost its old name, lost its trample and lost a mana in its activation cost. 

And then slivers went away for a long time.

### Come My *Legions*

Luckily for slivers, they had fans in R&D. We knew we were going to bring them back. We even knew we wanted to do it before *Tempest* rotated out of Extended to allow a time for the two eras of slivers to coexist. The only question was when. And then along came the *Onslaught* block with its tribal theme. And who was *Onslaught's* lead designer? Mike Elliott.

Mike toyed with the idea of putting slivers in *Onslaught* but eventually decided that their return was better suited to a small set. Here is a complete list of slivers that Mike designed in early *Legions* design:

As you can see, Mike originally created four cycles: a common cycle which was a repeat of the common *Tempest* slivers, a common cycle of slivers that graft a tap ability onto all slivers, an uncommon sliver with a saboteur ability an ability that triggers when it damages the opponent), and a cycle of offbeat rares. 

After collecting the feedback Mike (and later the development team) made a few key changes. First, he got rid of the common repeats. Then he moved the uncommon saboteur abilities to rare. And finally, he got rid of any slivers that didn't have the key sliver feeling (“creatures that had an ability that enhanced all other slivers in play"). It's interesting to note that Mike kept a few slivers (such as the “play as instant” or “cannot be countered” abilities) that didn't technically conform to the sliver guidelines but felt like they did. Sure, [Quick Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quick+Sliver) doesn't actually grant slivers in play the ability to be played as instants, but does that really matter?

### What The Future Holds

What does the future hold for slivers? As a twice-popular mechanic, I feel very confident in saying slivers will one day be back. What I can't answer is when. Hopefully today's column gave you a little better peek into how a mechanic is created and how it evolves over time. 

Before I go, I'd like to do my good deed of the week. You see, one of the luxuries of being a columnist is that I got a steady stream of feedback. When I have a success (like, say, *Mirrodin*), I got many kind letters saying all sorts of sweet things. But this is not true of the majority of R&D. So what can all of you do? As I explained in the column, the man responsible for 90% of all slivers is Mike Elliott. If you like slivers (or to be fair, if you hate them) write a letter to Mike via me (makingmagic@wizards.com) and I'll make sure he gets it. 

That's all I got for today. Join me next week when I tie up loose ends. (No, really. I mean it this time.)

Until then, may you know the joy of a army of 2/2 fliers with haste, first strike and regeneration.
