Next week, many of you will be home with your families, staring longingly out the window as the snow gently falls. Perhaps you'll imagine the hours of uproarious fun you could be having at your local game shop as the snow mounts ever higher outside your window. What's a **Magic** gamer to do when he or she is trapped at home?


Open that laptop and log onto **Magic Online**, obviously. Just because you're home with your family doesn't mean you can't shuffle up and battle!
