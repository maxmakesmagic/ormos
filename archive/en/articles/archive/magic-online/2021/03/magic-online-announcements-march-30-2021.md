Spotlight Cube Series: *Nega-Cube*
----------------------------------


Introducing Natalie Weizenbaum's *Nega-Cube*, the latest addition to our Spotlight Cube Series. Available on *Magic Online* from March 31 through April 7, *Nega-Cube* features cards that aren't a part of the major MTGO cubes (Vintage, Legacy, and Modern).


For a full list cards and an explanation of archetypes, check out [Natalie's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/spotlight-cube-series-nega-cube-2021-03-30).

*Time Spiral Remastered* Supreme Draft
--------------------------------------


*Time Spiral Remastered* is out on MTGO, and the week of Supreme Draft is almost up. If you like to Supreme Draft, don't miss your last chance to play *Time Spiral Remastered* Supreme Draft before the event ends tomorrow!

All-Access Weeks, Starring Super Qualifiers
-------------------------------------------


All-Access Weeks are back! From March 31 to April 14, the Mythic Event Token will be available in the *Magic Online* store that allows players to play with almost every card in *Magic Online*.


To use the Mythic Event Token, simply purchase it in the *Magic Online* store and enter a game or event. No cards will be added to your collection, but you'll be able to play with a deck even if you don't have all the cards in your collection.


The token is $25, and the access will last until downtime on April 14. (We'll remove all the Mythic Event Tokens from accounts then.)


And what better way to use that access than to play in Super Qualifiers? Every day from April 3 through April 9, there will be a Super Qualifier available to play in! We're upgrading the previously announced Pauper and Vintage Qualifiers and adding five more to play in. Whatever your format, we've got a Super Qualifier for you!


Each of these events will let you enter with two Mythic Event Tokens. That means that if you want to play in a Super Qualifier and have already gotten a Mythic Token, you can save on entry by picking up a second token instead of the normal entry options! And don't worry; spending your Mythic Event Tokens won't end your access early.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Saturday, April 3, 2021 | 7:00 a.m. | Pauper Super Qualifier |
| Sunday, April 4, 2021 | 7:00 a.m. | Vintage Super Qualifier |
