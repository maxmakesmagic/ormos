W**orld of Innistrad**

Innistrad is a dangerous plane filled with powerful magic. If you can overcome—or overpower—the evil here, you'll reap the rewards, unleashing those horrors on any who stand before you. How will your decks embrace this chilling new world? 

Horrifying creatures have always existed on Innistrad. The humans of this world have always relied on their faith to shield them from vampires and werewolves, spirits and ghouls. But of late, the holy wards and runes have begun to fail. The protection of travelers' shrines and rustic prayers grows weak. The spells of vampire slayers and wolfhunters are no longer proof against the creatures that prowl the shadows. The Lunarch, head of the revered Church of Avacyn, knows what the village priests whisper: that the archangel Avacyn has abandoned Innistrad. 

*Innistrad* goes on sale in the **Magic Online** Store on Monday, October 17 at 9:00 AM PDT (17:00 UTC). *Innistrad* becomes legal in ALL constructed formats following the October 12 scheduled maintenance. All appropriate Daily Events, Premier Events, and Queues will have *Innistrad* added to their prize structures after the scheduled maintenance on Wednesday, October 19.

Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for the *Innistrad* Release Events Championship, players are not permitted to have more than one of their accounts entered in any single event at one time. Players are not permitted to have any accounts entered in events played by other players for any reason. If a player is discovered to have more than one account playing in any end-of-season championship or championship event before, during, or after the event, Wizards may take action against that player's account(s), up to and including disqualification with no refund of product and/or event tickets, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s). 

Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the [Magic Online User Agreement](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/%20http:/wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358). If you play in **Magic Online** events, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are playing on your own account. We do not recognize excuses, such as "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that the adult has established. 

It will be the player's responsibility to make sure that they have been properly entered into this event and are able to join it PRIOR to the start of the Championship. If a player is qualified and is unable to join the Championship, they will need to contact customer service for assistance. 

**For all *Innistrad* Release Events, Wizards of the Coast may modify, suspend, and/or cancel an event, substitute prizes, or change the costs and/or schedule for an event without notice, at its sole discretion.**
