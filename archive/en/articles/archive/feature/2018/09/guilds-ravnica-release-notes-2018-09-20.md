The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Support.Wizards.com](http://support.wizards.com/).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

Returning Theme: Guilds and Guildmarks
--------------------------------------


Five guilds step into the spotlight in this latest return to the world of Ravnica: the House Dimir, the Izzet League, the Golgari Swarm, the Boros Legion, and the Selesnya Conclave.


Each guild has its own symbol that appears on cards associated with that guild. These guildmarks have no effect on gameplay or deck construction.




---

Dimir Keyword Action: Surveil
-----------------------------


To House Dimir, information is everything. The new *surveil* keyword action allows Dimir agents to craft a plan and stay several steps ahead of their opponents. Look at the top cards of your library—if you like what you see, set up the perfect draw. If not, send them to the graveyard and get closer to what you need.


![Dimir Informant](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_CZKGBy8ib0.png)


Dimir Informant  

2U  

Creature — Human Rogue  

1/4  

When Dimir Informant enters the battlefield, surveil 2. *(Look at the top two cards of your library, then put any number of them into your graveyard and the rest on top of your library in any order.)*


The official rules for surveil are as follows:


701.41. Surveil


701.41a To "surveil N" means to look at the top N cards of your library, then put any number of them into your graveyard and the rest on top of your library in any order.


701.41b If an effect allows you to look at additional cards while you surveil, those cards are included among the cards you may put into your graveyard and on top of your library in any order.


* Some spells that instruct you to surveil require targets. You can't cast a spell without choosing legal targets. If all of those targets become illegal, the spell doesn't resolve and you won't surveil.
* When you surveil, you may put all the cards you look at back on top of your library, you may put all of those cards into your graveyard, or you may put some of those cards on top and the rest of them into your graveyard.
* You perform the actions stated on a card in sequence. For some spells and abilities, you'll surveil last. For others, you'll surveil and then perform other actions.
* An ability that triggers "whenever you surveil" triggers after you're done surveilling, even if you have fewer cards in your library than the number of cards you're instructed to surveil. It even triggers if you have no cards in your library.



---

Izzet Keyword Ability: Jump-Start
---------------------------------


Experiments, explosions, and excitement: the Izzet love to invent their way to victory. Their latest breakthrough is *jump-start*. Discard an unwanted card from your hand to recast a spell with jump-start from your graveyard. If at first a spell succeeds, cast it again. Brilliant!


![Direct Current](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_M4zI2ue5sU.png)


Direct Current  

1RR  

Sorcery  

Direct Current deals 2 damage to any target.  

Jump-start *(You may cast this card from your graveyard by discarding a card in addition to paying its other costs. Then exile this card.)*


The official rules for jump-start are as follows:


702.132. Jump-Start


702.132a Jump-start appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities: one that functions while the card is in a player's graveyard and another that functions while the card is on the stack. "Jump-start" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by discarding a card as an additional cost to cast it" and "If this spell was cast using its jump-start ability, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack." Casting a spell using its jump-start ability follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.


* You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using jump-start only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
* A spell cast using jump-start will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.
* If an effect allows you to pay an alternative cost rather than a spell's mana cost, you may pay that alternative cost when you jump-start a spell. You'll still discard a card as an additional cost to cast it.
* If a card with jump-start is put into your graveyard during your turn, you'll be able to cast it right away if it's legal to do so, before an opponent can take any actions.



---

Golgari Ability Word: Undergrowth
---------------------------------


Death and rot are no strangers to the Golgari. Everything can be repurposed, reused, and recycled. Cards with *undergrowth* abilities get stronger for each creature card in your graveyard. The longer the battle rages on, the more dead there are to fuel the potent Golgari endgame.


![Rhizome Lurcher](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_i57L18rpW2.png)


Rhizome Lurcher  

2BG  

Creature — Fungus Zombie  

2/2  
*Undergrowth* — Rhizome Lurcher enters the battlefield with a number of +1/+1 counters on it equal to the number of creature cards in your graveyard.


Undergrowth is an ability word. Ability words appear in italics and have no rules meaning.


* Creature cards with other types, such as artifact creature cards, count for undergrowth abilities.
* Because tokens aren't cards, they never count for undergrowth abilities.



---

Boros Keyword Ability: Mentor
-----------------------------


As Ravnica gets more and more dangerous, the militaristic Boros train hard to eliminate weak links in their forces. When a creature with *mentor* attacks, it boosts a smaller ally. The result is a coordinated wave of angels, knights, and soldiers elevating each other into an unstoppable assault.


![Barging Sergeant](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_tfeUOXIaZt.png)


Barging Sergeant  

4R  

Creature — Minotaur Soldier  

4/2  

Haste  

Mentor *(Whenever this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on target attacking creature with lesser power.)*


The official rules for mentor are as follows:


702.133. Mentor


702.133a Mentor is a triggered ability. "Mentor" means "Whenever this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on target attacking creature with power less than this creature's power."


702.133b If a creature has multiple instances of mentor, each triggers separately.


* Mentor compares the power of the creature with mentor with that of the target creature at two different times: once as the triggered ability is put onto the stack, and once as the triggered ability resolves. If you wish to raise a creature's power so its mentor ability can target a bigger creature, the last chance you have to do so is during the beginning of combat step.
* If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
* If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.



---

Selesnya Keyword Ability: Convoke
---------------------------------


To the Selesnya, every soul matters. Rely on the power of community with *convoke*, a returning ability familiar to those who've chosen the ways of nature. Harness your population of smaller creatures to help cast gigantic elementals, colossal wurms, and more.


![Siege Wurm](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_cAcXsWioab.png)


Siege Wurm  

5GG  

Creature — Wurm  

5/5  

Convoke *(Your creatures can help cast this spell. Each creature you tap while casting this spell pays for 1 or one mana of that creature's color.)*  

Trample


The official rules for convoke are as follows:


702.50. Convoke


702.50a Convoke is a static ability that functions while the spell with convoke is on the stack. "Convoke" means "For each colored mana in this spell's total cost, you may tap an untapped creature of that color you control rather than pay that mana. For each generic mana in this spell's total cost, you may tap an untapped creature you control rather than pay that mana."


702.50b The convoke ability isn't an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost of the spell with convoke is determined.


702.50c A creature tapped to pay for mana in a spell's total cost this way is said to have "convoked" that spell.


702.50d Multiple instances of convoke on the same spell are redundant.


* You can tap an untapped creature you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn to convoke a spell.
* Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
* When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
* Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
* Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for 1 or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
* When using convoke to cast a spell with X in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Worldsoul Colossus (a spell with convoke and mana cost XGW) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is 3GW. If you tap two green creatures and two white creatures, you'll have to pay 1.
* If a creature you control has a mana ability with T in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.



---

Returning Mechanic: Hybrid Mana
-------------------------------


Hybrid mana symbols represent a cost that can be paid with either of two colors. For example, u/b can be paid with either U or B. It's both a blue and a black mana symbol.


![Whisper Agent](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_xNSBDqrc5Z.png)


Whisper Agent  

1u/bu/b  

Creature — Human Rogue  

3/2  

Flash  

When Whisper Agent enters the battlefield, surveil 1. *(Look at the top card of your library. You may put it into your graveyard.)*


* As you cast a spell or activate an activated ability with hybrid mana symbols in its cost, you choose which color of mana you will spend for each hybrid mana symbol. You do this at the same time you would choose modes or choose a value for an X in a mana cost. For example, you choose whether you'll cast Whisper Agent by paying 1UU, 1UB, or 1BB.
* Each two-color hybrid symbol adds 1 to a card's converted mana cost. For example, the converted mana cost of Whisper Agent is 3.
* A card with hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost is each color that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. For example, Whisper Agent is blue and black, even if you cast it with only blue mana.
* Similarly, a card's color identity (used in the Commander variant) always includes both of the colors that appear in a hybrid mana symbol on that card. Whisper Agent can't be included in a commander deck whose commander has a color identity of only blue, even though Whisper Agent could be cast with only blue mana.



---

Returning Mechanic: Split Cards
-------------------------------


Split cards return in the *Guilds of Ravnica* set, this time offering you more options than ever before! One half of the split card has a hybrid mana cost, and the other has a mana cost that requires two colors of mana.


![Response // Resurgence](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_g9crYLtqWF_side.png)


Response  

r/w r/w  

Instant  

Response deals 5 damage to target attacking or blocking creature.  

//  

Resurgence  

3RW  

Sorcery  

Creatures you control gain first strike and vigilance until end of turn. After this main phase, there is an additional combat phase followed by an additional main phase.


* To cast a split card, you choose one half to cast. There's no way to cast both halves of the split cards featured in this set.
* All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack as only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting spells with converted mana cost 4 or greater, you can still cast Response.
* Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard a split card, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Response // Resurgence counts once, not twice.
* Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one of those names, but not both.
* While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Response // Resurgence is both an instant card and a sorcery card and its converted mana cost is 7. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 5 or less from your hand, you can't cast Response or Resurgence.
* If you copy a spell that's half of a split card, the copy copies that same half. For example, if you copy Response, the copy is also Response, not Resurgence.



---

Returning Cycle: *Ravnica* Dual Lands
-------------------------------------


There are five nonbasic lands in the *Guilds of Ravnica* set that each have two basic land types.


![Watery Grave](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_eFa86ywKwG.png)


Watery Grave  

Land — Island Swamp  
*(T: Add U or B.)*  

As Watery Grave enters the battlefield, you may pay 2 life. If you don't, it enters the battlefield tapped.


* Unlike most dual lands, this land has two basic land types. It's not basic, so cards such as District Guide can't find it, but it does have the appropriate land types for effects such as that of Drowned Catacomb (from the *Ixalan* set).
* If an effect puts this land onto the battlefield tapped, you may pay 2 life, but it still enters tapped.



---

CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES
-------------------


![Affectionate Indrik](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_e9Dal59wsb.png)


Affectionate Indrik  

5G  

Creature — Beast  

4/4  

When Affectionate Indrik enters the battlefield, you may have it fight target creature you don't control. *(Each deals damage equal to its power to the other.)*


* You choose the target of the triggered ability as it goes on the stack, but you choose whether the creatures fight as that ability resolves.
* If the target creature is an illegal target when Affectionate Indrik's ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. If Affectionate Indrik is no longer on the battlefield, the target creature won't deal or be dealt damage.



---

![Arclight Phoenix](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_YCU3vLlUCq.png)


Arclight Phoenix  

3R  

Creature — Phoenix  

3/2  

Flying, haste  

At the beginning of combat on your turn, if you've cast three or more instant and sorcery spells this turn, return Arclight Phoenix from your graveyard to the battlefield.


* Because the beginning of combat step is before attackers are declared, you can attack with Arclight Phoenix during the same combat it returns to the battlefield.



---

![Artful Takedown](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_1UfIBJYnGq.png)


Artful Takedown  

2UB  

Instant  

Choose one or both —  

• Tap target creature.  

• Target creature gets -2/-4 until end of turn.


* Artful Takedown's two modes may each target the same creature, or they may target two different creatures.



---

![Assassin's Trophy](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_vc8KOUn4AF.png)


Assassin's Trophy  

BG  

Instant  

Destroy target permanent an opponent controls. Its controller may search their library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield, then shuffle their library.


* If the target permanent is an illegal target by the time Assassin's Trophy tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. No player searches their library.
* If the target permanent is a legal target but isn't destroyed, most likely because it has indestructible, its controller may search their library.
* If the permanent's controller doesn't search their library, they don't shuffle their library.



---

![Attendant of Vraska](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_3epgX76bMN.png)


Attendant of Vraska *(Planeswalker Deck only)*  

1BG  

Creature — Zombie Soldier  

3/3  

When Attendant of Vraska dies, if you control a Vraska planeswalker, you gain life equal to Attendant of Vraska's power.


* The amount of life gained is equal to Attendant of Vraska's power as it last existed on the battlefield.
* If Attendant of Vraska's power was negative, you don't lose or gain life.
* If you don't control a Vraska planeswalker as Attendant of Vraska's triggered ability resolves, possibly because Vraska left the battlefield at the same time as Attendant of Vraska, you won't gain life.



---

![Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_Ulg8LdPLjA.png)


Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice  

2RW  

Legendary Creature — Angel  

2/5  

Flying  

Mentor *(Whenever this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on target attacking creature with lesser power.)*  

At the beginning of combat on your turn, choose up to one target creature you control. Until end of turn, that creature gets +2/+0, gains trample if it's red, and gains vigilance if it's white.


* Aurelia's last ability resolves before attackers are chosen.
* The target creature gains trample and vigilance if it's both red and white. It gets +2/+0 only once, even if it's both red and white, and even if it's neither red nor white.
* Once Aurelia's last ability has resolved, the creature keeps whatever bonuses it got from that ability even if its colors change.



---

![Beacon Bolt](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_zV9MaPyb5c.png)


Beacon Bolt  

1UR  

Sorcery  

Beacon Bolt deals damage to target creature equal to the total number of instant and sorcery cards you own in exile and in your graveyard.  

Jump-start *(You may cast this card from your graveyard by discarding a card in addition to paying its other costs. Then exile this card.)*


* Beacon Bolt is still on the stack while you count your instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard and in exile. It doesn't count itself.
* If any exiled cards you own are face down, they have no characteristics. If they're normally instants or sorceries, they won't be counted.



---

![Beamsplitter Mage](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_prSKu1MZgg.png)


Beamsplitter Mage  

UR  

Creature — Vedalken Wizard  

2/2  

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that targets only Beamsplitter Mage, if you control one or more other creatures that spell could target, choose one of those creatures. Copy that spell. The copy targets the chosen creature.


* The ability triggers whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that targets only Beamsplitter Mage and no other object or player, and only if you control another creature that spell could target. If you cast an instant or sorcery spell that has multiple targets and Beamsplitter Mage is chosen as the target in each instance, Beamsplitter Mage's ability will trigger.
* If you don't control another creature the spell could target as Beamsplitter Mage's triggered ability resolves, you don't copy that spell.
* If Beamsplitter Mage leaves the battlefield or becomes an illegal target for the spell that caused its ability to trigger, that spell is still copied.
* If you copy a spell, you control the copy. It will resolve before the original spell does.
* The copy is created on the stack, so it's not cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like Beamsplitter Mage's ability itself) won't trigger.
* If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode cannot be chosen.
* If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Selective Snare does), the copy has the same value of X.
* The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
* In some rare cases, the original spell can target another creature but the copy can't (most likely because an effect modified the characteristics of the original spell on the stack and won't modify the copy). If the copy can't target the chosen creature, the copy isn't created.



---

![Beast Whisperer](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_98AjTXilKa.png)


Beast Whisperer  

2GG  

Creature — Elf Druid  

2/3  

Whenever you cast a creature spell, draw a card.


* Beast Whisperer's triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.



---

![Blood Operative](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_SmOnL86hCu.png)


Blood Operative  

1BB  

Creature — Vampire Assassin  

3/1  

Lifelink  

When Blood Operative enters the battlefield, you may exile target card from a graveyard.  

Whenever you surveil, if Blood Operative is in your graveyard, you may pay 3 life. If you do, return Blood Operative to your hand.


* If you surveil and put Blood Operative into your graveyard as you do so, its ability triggers once you've finished surveilling.
* No player may take actions between the time you choose to pay 3 life and the time you return Blood Operative to your hand.



---

![Bounty of Might](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_CxHRu4sr9M.png)


Bounty of Might  

4GG  

Instant  

Target creature gets +3/+3 until end of turn.  

Target creature gets +3/+3 until end of turn.  

Target creature gets +3/+3 until end of turn.


* You may choose the same creature as a target multiple times since Bounty of Might says "target creature" multiple times. You may give three different creatures +3/+3 each, one creature +6/+6 and another creature +3/+3, or a single creature +9/+9.



---

![Camaraderie](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_PZ8LN7sNCY.png)


Camaraderie  

4GW  

Sorcery  

You gain X life and draw X cards, where X is the number of creatures you control. Creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn.


* The second part of Camaraderie's effect affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+1.



---

![Centaur Peacemaker](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_YyZv5X6aeA.png)


Centaur Peacemaker  

1GW  

Creature — Centaur Cleric  

3/3  

When Centaur Peacemaker enters the battlefield, each player gains 4 life.


* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Centaur Peacemaker's ability causes each team to gain 8 life.



---

Chamber Sentry  

X  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

0/0

X, T, Remove X +1/+1 counters from Chamber Sentry: It deals X damage to any target.  

WUBRG: Return Chamber Sentry from your graveyard to your hand.


* You can choose any value for X as you cast Chamber Sentry. The value chosen for X doesn't directly affect the number of +1/+1 counters Chamber Sentry enters the battlefield with, but it does let you pay more mana and thus spend more colors of mana to cast it.
* If an effect allows you to spend mana as though it were mana of any color to cast Chamber Sentry, you consider only the actual mana spent to determine how many counters it receives.
* Colorless mana won't give Chamber Sentry another +1/+1 counter. Colorless is not a color.
* If Chamber Sentry enters the battlefield without being cast, it receives no +1/+1 counters.
* If another creature enters the battlefield as a copy of Chamber Sentry, consider what mana was spent to cast that creature to determine how many +1/+1 counters it enters with.
* The value of X chosen when you activate Chamber Sentry's first activated ability doesn't have to be the same value of X that you chose when you cast it.

Creatures you control gain indestructible. Take an extra turn after this one. At the beginning of that turn's end step, you lose the game.

* You can't choose not to exile a creature card from your graveyard if you have one to exile.
* You can activate Charnel Troll's last ability during your upkeep before its triggered ability resolves.
* Because your upkeep step is after your untap step, your lands will be untapped to help you activate Charnel Troll's last ability during your upkeep. However, because your upkeep step is before your draw step, you won't have drawn a card for the turn yet.

Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist. When the card returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the card that was exiled.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.

Dawn of Hope  

1W  

Enchantment  

Whenever you gain life, you may pay 2. If you do, draw a card.  

3W: Create a 1/1 white Soldier creature token with lifelink.


* Dawn of Hope's first ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Vicious Rumors or 3 life from Creeping Chill.
* You can't pay 2 multiple times to draw more than one card each time you resolve Dawn of Hope's triggered ability.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Dawn of Hope's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and Dawn of Hope's first ability triggers only once.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.

Dispersal  

3UB  

Instant  

Each opponent returns a nonland permanent they control with the highest converted mana cost among permanents they control to its owner's hand, then discards a card.


* If an opponent controls only lands as Dispersal resolves, that player won't return any permanent to their hand. They'll still discard a card.
* If a permanent has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* As Dispersal resolves, first the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's an opponent's turn, that opponent) chooses a nonland permanent they control with the highest mana cost among those permanents, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Then all the chosen permanents are returned at the same time. Next, each opponent in the same order chooses a card in hand without revealing it, then the chosen cards are discarded at the same time.

Divine Visitation  

3WW  

Enchantment  

If one or more creature tokens would be created under your control, that many 4/4 white Angel creature tokens with flying and vigilance are created instead.


* The token's characteristics are entirely replaced by a 4/4 white Angel creature token with flying and vigilance. It doesn't have any abilities the token would have been created with. Anything else specified in the effect creating the token (such as tapped, attacking, "That token gains haste," or "Exile that token at end of combat") still applies.
* If you create a noncreature token that will be a creature as it enters the battlefield, perhaps because of an effect such as that of March of the Machines, Divine Visitation's effect doesn't apply to that token's creation. (This is because Divine Visitation's effect modifies how the tokens are created, and March of the Machines's effect doesn't apply until you consider how the tokens are entering the battlefield.)
* If an effect changes under whose control a token would be created, that effect applies before Divine Visitation's effect applies.

When Dream Eater enters the battlefield, surveil 4. When you do, you may return target nonland permanent an opponent controls to its owner's hand. *(To surveil 4, look at the top four cards of your library, then put any number of them into your graveyard and the rest on top of your library in any order.)*


* Dream Eater's triggered ability goes on the stack without a target. While that ability is resolving, after you've surveilled, the reflexive triggered ability triggers and you pick a target nonland permanent to be returned to its owner's hand. This is different from effects that say "If you do . . ." in that you choose the target after having surveilled.
* Dream Eater's reflexive triggered ability triggers even if you have fewer than four cards in your library to surveil.

Emmara, Soul of the Accord  

GW  

Legendary Creature — Elf Cleric  

2/2  

Whenever Emmara, Soul of the Accord becomes tapped, create a 1/1 white Soldier creature token with lifelink.


* Emmara's ability is a triggered ability, not an activated ability. It doesn't allow you to tap Emmara whenever you want; rather, you need some other way of tapping it, such as by attacking.
* For the ability to trigger, Emmara has to actually change from untapped to tapped. If an effect attempts to tap Emmara, but it was already tapped at the time, this ability won't trigger.

* If you control a second Enhanced Surveillance, their effects both apply and you may look at an additional four cards. If you control a third, may look at an additional six cards, and so on.

Legendary Creature — Vampire Assassin  

3/5  

Etrata, the Silencer can't be blocked.  

Whenever Etrata deals combat damage to a player, exile target creature that player controls and put a hit counter on that card. That player loses the game if they own three or more exiled cards with hit counters on them. Etrata's owner shuffles Etrata into their library.


* If the player controls no creatures, Etrata's ability doesn't resolve. Etrata remains on the battlefield and its owner doesn't shuffle their library. The same is true if the target creature is an illegal target when Etrata's ability tries to resolve.
* If Etrata leaves the battlefield while its triggered ability is on the stack, it remains in its new zone and Etrata's owner shuffles their library.
* If Etrata's ability exiles a token creature, it won't count to determine whether three cards are exiled with hit counters.
* Etrata's owner shuffles it into their library as the triggered ability resolves, regardless of how many cards are in exile or whether the player loses the game.
* In a Commander game, if Etrata is your commander, you may put it into the command zone as its ability resolves. You'll still shuffle your library.

Instant  

Copy target instant or sorcery spell with converted mana cost 4 or less. You may choose new targets for the copy.  

//  

Explosion  

XUURR  

Instant  

Explosion deals X damage to any target. Target player draws X cards.


* Expansion can copy any instant or sorcery spell with an appropriate converted mana cost, not just one with targets.
* If a spell has X in its mana cost, include the value chosen for that X when determining the converted mana cost of that spell.
* The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
* If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Banefire does), the copy will have the same value of X.
* If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can). The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
* The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
* If you copy a spell, you control the copy. It will resolve before the original spell does.
* If one of Explosion's two targets becomes illegal, the other is affected as appropriate.

Enchantment  

You may look at the top card of your library any time.  

You may play the top card of your library.  

You can't play cards from your hand.  

3R: Destroy Experimental Frenzy.


* Experimental Frenzy lets you look at the top card of your library whenever you want (with one restriction—see below), even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand.
* If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability. This means that if you cast the top card of your library, you can't look at the next one until you're done paying for that spell.
* You must follow the normal timing permissions and restrictions of the cards you play from your library.
* You can play a land card on top of your library only if you have available land plays remaining.
* You'll still pay all costs for a spell you cast from your library, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs.
* You can't cast spells or play lands from your hand, but you may take other actions with those cards (such as discarding them to activate their cycling or bloodrush abilities).

*Undergrowth* — When you cast this spell, reveal the top X cards of your library, where X is the number of creature cards in your graveyard. You may put a green permanent card with converted mana cost X or less from among them onto the battlefield. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.


* Hatchery Spider's ability triggers as you cast it, and that ability resolves before the spell itself. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* If a card in your library has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* A land card that produces green mana, even a Forest, normally has no color.

Hellkite Whelp  

4R

Flying  

Whenever Hellkite Whelp attacks, it deals 1 damage to target creature defending player controls.


* If a creature attacks a planeswalker, that planeswalker's controller is the defending player.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Hellkite Whelp's triggered ability can target only a creature controlled by the player it's attacking. It can't target a creature controlled by that player's teammate.

House Guildmage  

UB  

Creature — Human Wizard  

2/2  

1U, T: Target creature doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.  

2B, T: Surveil 2. *(Look at the top two cards of your library, then put any number of them into your graveyard and the rest on top of your library in any order.)*


* House Guildmage's first ability doesn't tap the creature. It can target any creature, tapped or untapped. If that creature is already untapped at the beginning of its controller's next untap step, the effect won't do anything.

![Hypothesizzle](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_BhsLE1wlg3.png)


Hypothesizzle  

3UR  

Instant  

Draw two cards. Then you may discard a nonland card. When you do, Hypothesizzle deals 4 damage to target creature.


* Hypothesizzle goes on the stack without a target. While that spell is resolving, you may discard a card. When you do, the reflexive triggered ability triggers and you pick a target creature to be dealt damage. This is different from effects that say "If you do . . ." in that you choose the target after having drawn two cards.

![Integrity // Intervention](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_PKkBktGxTP_side.png)


Integrity

Invert  

u/r  

Instant  

Switch the power and toughness of each of up to two target creatures until end of turn.  

//  

Invent  

4UR  

Instant  

Search your library for an instant card and/or a sorcery card, reveal them, put them into your hand, then shuffle your library.


* Invert has received errata to have its effect last only until end of turn. The correct Oracle wording appears above.
* If you chose two targets, Invert switches the power and toughness of one creature and it switches the power and toughness of another creature. It doesn't switch one creature's power with another creature's power.
* Effects that switch a creature's power and toughness apply after all other effects, regardless of when those effects began to apply. For instance, if you cast Invert targeting a 1/2 creature then give it +2/+0 later in the turn, it's a 2/3 creature, not a 4/1 creature.
* While resolving Invent, you could put no cards, an instant card, a sorcery card, or an instant card and a sorcery card into your hand.

![Ionize](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_sTifUd4V5f.png)


Ionize  

1UR

Counter target spell. Ionize deals 2 damage to that spell's controller.


* A spell that can't be countered is a legal target for Ionize. The spell won't be countered when Ionize resolves, but Ionize still deals 2 damage to that spell's controller.

BG, Sacrifice another creature: You gain 1 life and draw a card.


* You can activate Izoni's last ability while its undergrowth ability is on the stack. This will increase the number of Insect tokens you'll create.

Untap all creatures you control. They gain hexproof and indestructible until end of turn. *(They can't be the targets of spells or abilities your opponents control. Damage and effects that say "destroy" don't destroy them.)*

Reach  
*Undergrowth* — When Kraul Harpooner enters the battlefield, choose up to one target creature with flying you don't control. Kraul Harpooner gets +X/+0 until end of turn, where X is the number of creature cards in your graveyard, then you may have Kraul Harpooner fight that creature.


* The value of X is determined only as the undergrowth ability resolves. If the number of creature cards in your graveyard changes later in the turn, Kraul Harpooner is unaffected.
* You choose the target of the triggered ability (or that it has no target) as it goes on the stack, but you choose whether the creatures fight as that ability resolves.
* If you choose a target and the target creature is an illegal target when Kraul Harpooner's ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve and Kraul Harpooner doesn't get +X/+0. If the target creature is legal but Kraul Harpooner is no longer on the battlefield, the target creature won't deal or be dealt damage.
* If you don't choose a target creature, Kraul Harpooner simply gets +X/+0 until end of turn.

Sorcery  

Lava Coil deals 4 damage to target creature. If that creature would die this turn, exile it instead.


* Lava Coil's replacement effect will exile the target creature if it would die this turn for any reason, not just due to lethal damage. It applies to the target creature even if Lava Coil deals no damage to it (due to a prevention effect).

Lazav, the Multifarious  

UB  

Legendary Creature — Shapeshifter  

1/3  

When Lazav, the Multifarious enters the battlefield, surveil 1. *(Look at the top card of your library. You may put it into your graveyard.)*  

X: Lazav, the Multifarious becomes a copy of target creature card in your graveyard with converted mana cost X, except its name is Lazav, the Multifarious, it's legendary in addition to its other types, and it has this ability.


* Lazav copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else, except the characteristics it specifically modifies. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
* Any effects that applied to Lazav before it becomes a copy of another card will continue to apply once it's become a copy. The same is true of any counters that are on Lazav.
* If a card in your graveyard has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* Because Lazav isn't entering the battlefield when it becomes a copy of a card, any "When this enters the battlefield" or "This enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied card won't apply.
* If the copied card has an ability that can be activated only once each turn, copying that card a second time will allow you to activate the new instance of that ability.

![League Guildmage](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_wq79LzXvk9.png)


League Guildmage  

UR  

Creature — Human Wizard  

2/2  

3U, T: Draw a card.  

XR, T: Copy target instant or sorcery spell you control with converted mana cost X. You may choose new targets for the copy.


* If a spell has X in its mana cost, include the value chosen for that X when determining the converted mana cost of that spell.
* League Guildmage's second ability can copy any instant or sorcery spell you control, not just one with targets.
* The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
* If you copy a spell, you control the copy. It will resolve before the original spell does.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
* If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Banefire does), the copy will have the same value of X.
* If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can). The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
* The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.

Whenever Ledev Champion attacks, you may tap any number of untapped creatures you control. Ledev Champion gets +1/+1 until end of turn for each creature tapped this way.  

3GW: Create a 1/1 white Soldier creature token with lifelink.


* For Ledev Champion's first ability, the creatures to tap are chosen as the ability resolves. No player may take actions between the time you choose the creatures to tap and the time Ledev Champion's power and toughness are boosted.
* Attacking creatures with vigilance may be tapped for Ledev Champion's first ability. If Ledev Champion itself has vigilance, it can be tapped this way, too. These creatures aren't removed from combat.
* Creatures that have come under your control this turn can be tapped for Ledev Champion's first ability.
* You can tap creatures this way only as Ledev Champion's triggered ability is resolving. You can't tap more creatures later in combat to give it +1/+1 again.

Mentor *(Whenever this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on target attacking creature with lesser power.)*  

At the beginning of combat on your turn, create a 1/1 red Goblin creature token. That token gains haste until end of turn and attacks this combat if able.


* If the token can't attack for any reason (such as becoming tapped), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.

All creatures get -1/-1 until end of turn.  

Surveil 2. *(Look at the top two cards of your library, then put any number of them into your graveyard and the rest on top of your library in any order.)*


* Creatures that are going to die after getting -1/-1 will still be on the battlefield while you surveil. They won't be put into their owners' graveyards until after Mephitic Vapors is entirely finished resolving. If any of their abilities trigger on surveilling, those abilities will trigger but won't resolve until after the creatures have left the battlefield.
* Mephitic Vapors affects only creatures on the battlefield at the time it resolves. Creatures that enter the battlefield later in the turn won't get -1/-1.

Instant  

Surveil 2, then choose an instant or sorcery card in your graveyard. You may cast that card this turn. If that card would be put into your graveyard this turn, exile it instead. *(To surveil 2, look at the top two cards of your library, then put any number of them into your graveyard and the rest on top of your library in any order.)*


* The instant or sorcery card you choose may be one that you just surveilled into your graveyard.
* Mission Briefing doesn't change when you can cast the chosen card. For example, if you choose a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
* Mission Briefing is still on the stack while you choose an instant or sorcery card in your graveyard. Your Mission Briefing can't be to give yourself that same Mission Briefing.
* If you cast a spell this way and that card is exiled, it's considered a new object in the zone it's put into. It won't be exiled if it's put into your graveyard later in the turn.

1UB  

Sorcery  

Exile all cards from all opponents' graveyards. You may cast those cards this turn, and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any type to cast those spells. At the beginning of the next end step, if any of those cards remain exiled, return them to their owners' graveyards.  

Exile Mnemonic Betrayal.


* You can't play land cards exiled this way.
* Mnemonic Betrayal doesn't change when you can cast the exiled cards. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
* If you cast a spell this way and that card is exiled, it's considered a new object. Mnemonic Betrayal no longer allows you to cast it. It remains in exile when Mnemonic Betrayal's delayed triggered ability resolves.
* Only the cards that remain in exile are returned to their owners' graveyards. For example, a permanent spell cast this way will remain on the battlefield.
* In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spells or permanents you control from Mnemonic Betrayal's effect are exiled. If you leave the game before Mnemonic Betrayal's delayed triggered ability resolves, the cards remain exiled.

*Undergrowth* — This spell costs 1 less to cast for each creature card in your graveyard.  

When Molderhulk enters the battlefield, return target land card from your graveyard to the battlefield.


* If an effect allows you to cast Molderhulk from your graveyard, its undergrowth ability doesn't count itself. It's already on the stack when you determine the total cost to cast it.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as Molderhulk's undergrowth ability). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.

2/3  
*Undergrowth* — When Moodmark Painter enters the battlefield, target creature gains menace and gets +X/+0 until end of turn, where X is the number of creature cards in your graveyard. *(It can't be blocked except by two or more creatures.)*


* The value of X is determined only as the undergrowth ability resolves. If the number of creature cards in your graveyard changes later in the turn, the target creature is unaffected.

* Necrotic Wound's replacement effect will exile the target creature if it would die this turn for any reason, not just immediately after Necrotic Wound resolves.

This spell can't be countered.  

Flying  

Whenever you draw a card, Niv-Mizzet, Parun deals 1 damage to any target.  

Whenever a player casts an instant or sorcery spell, you draw a card.


* If an effect instructs you to draw multiple cards, Niv-Mizzet's first triggered ability triggers that many times. You choose targets for those abilities after you've drawn all of the cards.
* If a spell or ability causes you to put cards into your hand without specifically using the word "draw," Niv-Mizzet's first triggered ability won't trigger.
* Niv-Mizzet's second triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered. This causes its first triggered ability to trigger, and that also resolves before the spell.
* Players can cast spells and activate abilities after Niv-Mizzet's second triggered ability resolves but before the spell that caused it to trigger does. Notably, the card you draw may be able to counter that spell.

2: Nullhide Ferox loses all abilities until end of turn. Any player may activate this ability.  

If a spell or ability an opponent controls causes you to discard Nullhide Ferox, put it onto the battlefield instead of putting it into your graveyard.


* Nullhide Ferox's activated ability can be activated only while it's on the battlefield. Players can't, for example, activate it to try to stop its replacement effect from putting it onto the battlefield.
* Once Nullhide Ferox's activated ability has resolved, it can gain new abilities. It won't lose those abilities.
* Once Nullhide Ferox has lost its activated ability that makes it lose its abilities, that ability can't be activated again until the turn's over.

Deathtouch  

All creatures able to block Ochran Assassin do so.


* Remember that a source with deathtouch must deal damage to a creature for that creature to be destroyed. If five creatures block Ochran Assassin while its power is still 1, only one of them (of Ochran Assassin's controller's choice) will be the one dealt damage and destroyed. You'll have to raise Ochran Assassin's power to destroy more than one creature.
* If a creature the defending player controls can't block Ochran Assassin for any reason (such as being tapped), then it doesn't block Ochran Assassin. If there's a cost associated with having a creature block Ochran Assassin, the defending player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to block in that case either.

Ornery Goblin

Whenever Ornery Goblin blocks or becomes blocked by a creature, Ornery Goblin deals 1 damage to that creature.

Pelt Collector  

G  

Creature — Elf Warrior  

1/1  

Whenever another creature you control enters the battlefield or dies, if that creature's power is greater than Pelt Collector's, put a +1/+1 counter on Pelt Collector.  

As long as Pelt Collector has three or more +1/+1 counters on it, it has trample.


* To determine if Pelt Collector's first ability triggers when a creature enters the battlefield, use the creature's power after applying any static abilities (such as that of Trostani Discordant) that modify its power.
* To determine if Pelt Collector's first ability triggers when a creature dies, use its power as it last existed on the battlefield.
* If a creature with power less than or equal to Pelt Collector's power enters the battlefield or dies, Pelt Collector's first ability doesn't trigger at all. You can't try to raise that creature's power or lower Pelt Collector's to get a counter.
* As Pelt Collector's first ability resolves, if the entering creature's power is no longer greater than Pelt Collector's power, or if Pelt Collector's power has been raised to greater than or equal to the power of the creature that died, Pelt Collector doesn't get a +1/+1 counter. Notably, this means that if Pelt Collector is still a 1/1 creature and two 2/2 creatures die, it only gets one +1/+1 counter as the first triggered ability resolves, and it will be too big to get a counter as the second triggered ability resolves.
* If the entering creature leaves the battlefield while Pelt Collector's triggered ability is on the stack, use its power as it last existed on the battlefield to determine whether Pelt Collector gets a +1/+1 counter.
* If Pelt Collector's power becomes less than 0, a creature with 0 power (or with power less than 0 but still greater than Pelt Collector's power) entering the battlefield or dying will cause its first ability to trigger.
* If Pelt Collector is dealt lethal damage at the same time as a larger creature you control, they're destroyed at the same time. Pelt Collector won't get an additional +1/+1 from its ability in time to save it.

When Plaguecrafter enters the battlefield, each player sacrifices a creature or planeswalker. Each player who can't discards a card.


* As Plaguecrafter's ability resolves, first the player whose turn it is chooses a creature or planeswalker they control, then each other player in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Then all the chosen permanents are sacrificed at the same time. Next, each player in the same order who couldn't sacrifice a permanent chooses a card in hand without revealing it, then the chosen cards are discarded at the same time.
* Each player chooses a permanent to sacrifice from among the creatures and planeswalkers they control. You don't choose which type of permanent any other player has to sacrifice.
* Plaguecrafter can be the creature its controller sacrifices for its own ability. Don't be like Plaguecrafter; always wear personal protective equipment when performing dangerous work.

1UU  

Sorcery  

Create a token that's a copy of target creature you control.  

Jump-start *(You may cast this card from your graveyard by discarding a card in addition to paying its other costs. Then exile this card.)*


* The token copies exactly what is printed on the creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If the copied creature has X in its mana cost, X is 0.
* If the copied creature is copying something else, the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature is copying.
* If the copied creature is itself a token, the token created by Quasiduplicate copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.

* If any exiled cards you own are face down, they have no characteristics. If they're normally instants or sorceries, they won't be counted for Ral's second ability.
* The emblem created by Ral's last ability is colorless. The damage it deals is from a colorless source.
* The triggered ability of Ral's emblem resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* If the target permanent or player becomes an illegal target for the triggered ability of Ral's emblem, the ability doesn't resolve. You don't draw two cards.

* If you cast Resurgence when it's not a main phase (perhaps with Omnispell Adept's ability), creatures you control gain first strike and vigilance, but there's no additional combat phase or main phase. If you cast it during an opponent's main phase, there are additional combat and main phases, but that player attacks during that combat phase, not you.

* Runaway Steam-Kin's triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* If Runaway Steam-Kin has three or more +1/+1 counters on it after you're done paying for a red spell, its ability doesn't trigger at all. If it has three or more +1/+1 counters on it as its triggered ability resolves, it doesn't get a +1/+1 counter.

Creature — Specter  

2/2  

Flying  

Whenever Thief of Sanity deals combat damage to a player, look at the top three cards of that player's library, exile one of them face down, then put the rest into their graveyard. You may look at and cast that card for as long as it remains exiled, and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any type to cast that spell.


* Thief of Sanity's effect doesn't change when you can cast the exiled card. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
* An effect that instructs you to "cast" a card doesn't allow you to play lands.
* You can still cast the exiled card if Thief of Sanity leaves the battlefield or leaves your control. If another player gains control of Thief of Sanity, that player can't cast the exiled card.
* Casting an exiled card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.
* In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spells or permanents you control from Thief of Sanity's effect are exiled, and any of the face-down exiled cards remain face down indefinitely. No player may look at them.

Defender  

Whenever you surveil, put a +1/+1 counter on Thoughtbound Phantasm.  

As long as Thoughtbound Phantasm has three or more +1/+1 counters on it, it can attack as though it didn't have defender.

* Once Thoughtbound Phantasm has attacked, removing +1/+1 counters from it won't remove it from combat.

![Thousand-Year Storm](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_vHumMmIMYN.png)


Thousand-Year Storm  

4UR  

Enchantment  

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, copy it for each other instant and sorcery spell you've cast before it this turn. You may choose new targets for the copies.


* Spells you've cast that were countered were still cast, and so will add copies when Thousand-Year Storm's ability resolves for later spells in the turn.
* If an effect instructs you to cast multiple spells, they're cast one at a time in any order.
* Thousand-Year Storm's ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
* Copies are created even if the spell that caused Thousand-Year Storm's ability to trigger has been countered by the time that ability resolves. The copies resolve before the original spell.
* The copies will have the same targets as the spell they're copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. The new targets must be legal.
* If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copies will have the same mode or modes. You can't choose different ones.
* If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copies will have the same value of X.
* If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can). The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copies. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.
* The copies that Thousand-Year Storm's ability creates are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (such as that of Thousand-Year Storm itself) won't trigger.

Trostani Discordant  

3GW  

Legendary Creature — Dryad  

1/4  

Other creatures you control get +1/+1.  

When Trostani Discordant enters the battlefield, create two 1/1 white Soldier creature tokens with lifelink.  

At the beginning of your end step, each player gains control of all creatures they own.


* The owner of a token is the player who created it.
* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to other creatures you control may become lethal if Trostani leaves the battlefield during that turn.
* If a creature has an ability that triggers at the beginning of each end step and Trostani's ability causes you to gain control of it, the ability of that creature is still controlled by the creature's former controller. If the creature has an ability that triggers at the beginning of your end step, that ability doesn't trigger when you gain control of it.

Truefire Captain  

RRWW  

Creature — Human Knight  

4/3  

Mentor *(Whenever this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on target attacking creature with lesser power.)*  

Whenever Truefire Captain is dealt damage, it deals that much damage to target player.


* Truefire Captain's last ability will trigger even if it is dealt lethal damage. For example, if it's dealt damage by a 7/7 creature it's blocking, its ability will trigger and Truefire Captain will deal 7 damage to the target player.
* If your life total is brought to 0 or less at the same time that Truefire Captain is dealt damage, you lose the game before its triggered ability goes on the stack.

![Undercity Uprising](https://media.wizards.com/2018/grn/en_8LN1hOoQya.png)


Undercity Uprising  

2BG  

Sorcery  

Creatures you control gain deathtouch until end of turn. Then target creature you control fights target creature you don't control. *(Each deals damage equal to its power to the other.)*


* Remember that a source with deathtouch has to deal damage, but not necessarily combat damage, to destroy another creature. As long as the fighting creature you control has power greater than 0 (and the damage isn't prevented), the fighting creature you don't control will be destroyed.
* If one of the two target creatures is an illegal target by the time Undercity Uprising tries to resolve, no creature deals or is dealt damage. Creatures you control still gain deathtouch.
* If both target creatures are illegal targets by the time Undercity Uprising tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. No creatures deal damage or gain deathtouch.
* The first part of Undercity Uprising's effect affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't gain deathtouch.

Underrealm Lich  

3BG  

Creature — Zombie Elf Shaman  

4/3  

If you would draw a card, instead look at the top three cards of your library, then put one into your hand and the rest into your graveyard.  

Pay 4 life: Underrealm Lich gains indestructible until end of turn. Tap it.


* If an effect instructs you to draw multiple cards, each draw is performed—and replaced by Underrealm Lich's ability—one at a time. This means that if you're drawing two cards, you'll look at the top three cards of your library, put one into your hand, put the other two into your graveyard, and then repeat the process with the next three cards in your library.
* Underrealm Lich's first ability applies even if you have fewer than three cards in your library. If you have no cards in your library, you can't lose the game for trying to draw a card from an empty library.
* You can activate Underrealm Lich's last ability even if it's already tapped. It can't be tapped again, but it still gains indestructible.

When Venerated Loxodon enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature that convoked it.


* You can't tap more creatures to convoke Venerated Loxodon than it takes to pay for its total cost. This means that normally no more than five creatures can convoke it.

Vicious Rumors  

B  

Sorcery  

Vicious Rumors deals 1 damage to each opponent. Each opponent discards a card, then puts the top card of their library into their graveyard. You gain 1 life.


* As Vicious Rumors resolves, it deals 1 damage to each opponent, then the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's an opponent's turn, that opponent) chooses a card in hand without revealing it, then each other opponent in turn order does the same. Then the chosen cards are discarded at the same time. Next, each opponent puts the top card of their library into their graveyard at the same time. Finally, you gain 1 life.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Vicious Rumors causes the opposing team to lose 2 life, each of those players discards a card and puts the top card of their library into their graveyard, and you gain 1 life.

*Undergrowth* — When Vigorspore Wurm enters the battlefield, target creature gains vigilance and gets +X/+X until end of turn, where X is the number of creature cards in your graveyard.  

Vigorspore Wurm can't be blocked by more than one creature.


* The value of X is determined only as the undergrowth ability resolves. If the number of creature cards in your graveyard changes later in the turn, the target creature is unaffected.
* If there are no creature cards in your graveyard, the target creature just gains vigilance until end of turn.
* If Vigorspore Wurm gains menace, it can't be blocked at all.

Destroy target creature. You gain life equal to its toughness. You may search your library and/or graveyard for a card named Vraska, Regal Gorgon, reveal it, and put it into your hand. If you search your library this way, shuffle it.

Creature — Human Soldier

Mentor *(Whenever this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on target attacking creature with lesser power.)*  

Wojek Bodyguard can't attack or block alone.


* If you control more than one Wojek Bodyguard, they can attack or block together, even if no other creatures attack or block.
* Although Wojek Bodyguard can't attack alone, other attacking creatures don't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, Wojek Bodyguard could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls. Similarly, other blocking creatures don't have to block the same creature that Wojek Bodyguard blocks.
* Once Wojek Bodyguard has attacked or blocked, it will remain in combat even if you no longer control another attacking or blocking creature.
* If an effect says that Wojek Bodyguard attacks or blocks if able and you control another creature able to attack or block, you must attack or block with Wojek Bodyguard and another creature.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Wojek Bodyguard can attack or block with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control are attacking or blocking.
