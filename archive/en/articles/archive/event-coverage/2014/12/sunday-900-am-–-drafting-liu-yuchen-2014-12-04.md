Sunday, 9:00 a.m. – Drafting With Liu Yuchen
============================================



 Posted in **Event Coverage**
 on December 4, 2014 










Liu Yuchen may not have trotted the globe for Pro Tours and Grand Prixes but he is not without achievements in the local arena. A widely-respected player among his fellow comrades, he has proven to be of superior caliber as he sits in Pod One of the second draft. Initially at a comfortable 5-1 record, he jokingly admitted to me that he was now having the jitters since the whole world would be watching his draft. I am sure he would not disappoint.


### Booster One (New Phyrexia)


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chancellor+of+the+Dross)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor+of+the+Dross)
Liu was quick to decide upon [Shrine of Loyal Legions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Loyal+Legions) over [Vol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vol)t [Char](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Char)ge and was gifted with a second pick [Chancellor of the Dross](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor+of+the+Dross). He then opted for [Gremlin Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gremlin+Mine) over [Slash Panther](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slash+Panther) and could not resist slapping [Spire Monitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Monitor) into his pile for pick four. He managed to pick up a couple of removal spells in the form of [Parasitic Implant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parasitic+Implant) and an 11th pick [Mortis Dogs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortis+Dogs) which could go well in his Blue Black beatdown deck.


1st [Shrine of Loyal Legions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Loyal+Legions)  

2nd [Chancellor of the Dross](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor+of+the+Dross)  

3rd [Gremlin Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gremlin+Mine)  

4th [Spire Monitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Monitor)  

5th [Parasitic Implant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parasitic+Implant)  

6th [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe)  

7th [Maul Splicer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maul+Splicer)  

8th [Geth's Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geth%27s+Verdict)  

9th [Triumph of the Hordes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triumph+of+the+Hordes)  

10th [Loxodon Convert](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Convert)  

11th [Mortis Dogs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortis+Dogs)  

12th [Ogre Menial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Menial)

14th [Darksteel Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Relic)


### Booster Two (Mirrodin Besieged)


Having solidified in both his colors, he sought to strengthen his deck with additional fliers. [Skinwing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinwing) made a perfect pick and he managed to secure [Spread the Sickness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spread+the+Sickness) as his second pick, even if he had to pass [Victory's Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Victory%27s+Herald) for it. He said it was not worth it to switch gears for a card that that is never splashable. His forth pick was not easy either, as he was greeted with a truckload of candy. Between [Peace Strider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peace+Strider), [Morbid Plunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Plunder), [Serum Raker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Raker) and [Strandwalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strandwalker), he eventually decided on the Living Weapon. Two [Steel Sabotage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Sabotage)s and a [Quicksilver Geyser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Geyser) rounded up his picks for the second booster.


1st [Skinwing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinwing)  

2nd [Spread the Sickness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spread+the+Sickness)

10th [Steel Sabotage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Sabotage)  

11th [Flensermite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flensermite)  

12th [Spire Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Serpent)

### Booster Three (Scars of Mirrodin)


Liu opened a weak booster containing only [Asceticism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asceticism) and [Slice in Twain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+in+Twain) as relevant picks and he had to settle for a lowly [Iron Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr). This was only the beginning of his misfortune as he was forced to ship another two copies of [Slice in Twain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+in+Twain) along with [Ezuri's Brigade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%27s+Brigade) and picking up more critters along the way. With three Myrs now in his pile, he needed some win conditions to accelerate into and at the end of the Scars of Mirrodin booster, he was able to pick up three copies of [Scrapdiver Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapdiver+Serpent). When questioned, he mentioned that the [Slice in Twain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+in+Twain)s weren't particularly good against him and it was the least of his worries.


1st [Iron Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr)  

2nd [Neurok Invisimancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Invisimancer)  

3rd [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr)  

4th [Silver Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr)  

5th [Necrogen Scudder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Scudder)  

6th [Moriok Reaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Reaver)  

7th [Scrapdiver Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapdiver+Serpent)  

8th [Clone Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell)  

9th [Scrapdiver Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapdiver+Serpent)  

10th [Blackcleave Cliffs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackcleave+Cliffs)  

11th [Scrapdiver Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapdiver+Serpent)  

12th [Shape Anew](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shape+Anew)  

13th [Liquimetal Coating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liquimetal+Coating)  

14th [Whitesun's Passage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitesun%27s+Passage)


I asked him if he felt optimistic about his chances to win out with this deck and he VERY promptly replied that it was virtually impossible. "Its a 1-2 deck. 2-1 at best. I would be extremely happy if I achieved that." Somewhat embarrassed to be playing with two [Scrapdiver Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapdiver+Serpent)s with the possibility to sideboard in a third copy, he naturally tried to shy away from the camera, to the amusement of the crowd. We wish Liu the best of luck as he enters round eight.
