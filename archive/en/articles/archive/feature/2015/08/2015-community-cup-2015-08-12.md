By Wizards of the Coast











The Community Cup is coming back this year, taking place Sept. 19–20. Today we want to introduce you to our two teams. We will be releasing further information about the event, the formats, and more in the coming weeks.


This year, you might have noticed there wasn't a community vote to choose these guys and gals. Boo, right? But here's the thing. This list is chock full of awesome people, and after holding the Community Cup for years, we wanted to get some new and awesome blood in here to ~~lose terribly to~~ challenge the Wizards team. After we started brainstorming people to put on the list, we looked at our initial pass and thought "Wouldn't this be an awesome group to bring in?" And they are an awesome group. So we're bringing them in.


Without further ado, the Community Team:


**Kenji Egashira**
