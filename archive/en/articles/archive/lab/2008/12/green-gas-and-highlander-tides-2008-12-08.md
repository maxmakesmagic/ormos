Hey there, to everyone who has stopped by From the Lab once again on a Wednesday! If you're new to the shenanigans, here's a quick low-down: kooky decks, wacky synergy, the use of forgotten cards, and ...LOOK OUT FOR THAT PREDATOR DRAGON BEHIND YOU!!!!

![Don't feed the dragons](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl16_feed.jpg)... Sorry, newcomers. No, I don't let dragons run loose around the lab (although a dragon zoo would be beyond awesome). I'm pretty sure that was the same 16/16 [Predator Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator+Dragon) from [last week's](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/15) final deck. What can I say? It followed me home.

Okay, I'm stretching the truth. Or lying. Or desperately rambling through this introduction. Before my ADD-worthy attention span turns to something else entirely, the plan for today is this: I'm just going to pretend it's not a non-theme week, and instead it's Jund Week II, as symbolized by that [Predator Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator+Dragon) that's currently sniffing behind your shoulder. When coming up with Jund Week material, I realized that there were a lot of build-around-me cards specifically in the color green. I ultimately opted to indulge the red side of Jund last week, and save the jade goodies for this week. As you all can probably guess from today's corny column title, that's just how it turned out. (What do I mean by Highlander tides? In time, singleton suitors, in time.)

Before we hop into all things mana and plasm (possibly in the same card), let's talk green a bit. I've been reading nearly every article on **magicthegathering.com** every week for quite a while now, and this practice has not stopped during my tenure here in the Lab. I've also always been a curious onlooker on the mysterious dessert known as the color pie, and even though one color has always warmed my heart the most (do I have to say it?), all five colors truly appeal to me. It should be no surprise, then, that I've pored over Mark Rosewater's five color interviews during these theme weeks. I would have talked more about this during [Naya Week](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/11) (green's scheduled time to shine) but a certain Bob had a tale to tell.

According to Mr. Green's [behind-the-scenes interview](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/11), two major themes in the viridian-tinged philosophy are nature and life. Besides the behemoth I have for you as today's last deck, I found it fun to tap the [Manaplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaplasm)- and [Mycoloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mycoloth)-based decks into these themes. From the cards themselves, it's clear they hit the desired target. [Manaplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaplasm) thrives off of nature, and the mana that is gleaned from it. Land essentially feeds our favorite sludgy ooze. [Mycoloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mycoloth), on the other hand, proves itself a master of the circle of life. It both takes the life of your own creatures when devouring them, and creating tons of Saproling tokens, all the while looking like a cross between Man-Thing and King-Kong. For today, I figured I'd mostly combine this aspect of green with everything spunky I like in red.

Basically, what I'm saying is that I've got a Vorthos streak at least a couple blocks wide, as opposed to my miles of Johnnyness. Believe me, tapping into your creative side is worthwhile, and sometimes it helps you build wackier decks. Did this experiment pan out? Tune in next paragraph to find out!

Wave of Plasmutilation
[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=%5Bcard%5D)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%5Bcard%5D)Some surfers say that the hardest waves to successfully board are the tight, looping ones with lots of rough edges. These surfers have obviously never met [Manaplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaplasm), which (according to the card art) is a giant wave of ooze that (according to the flavor text) has already claimed one victim and can (according to the card text) totally crush opponents in various ways. I even saw [Manaplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaplasm) put an opponent's wife's hand into a jar of acid once. At a party. This thing is a beast.

Assuming you have a four-drop (say, oh, [Chameleon Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus)) ready to go the turn after you've played [Manaplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaplasm), the enthusiastic ooze becomes a drawback-less [Phyrexian Negator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Negator). With a five-drop after that, you've potentially dealt a total of 15 damage already (the 'Plasm becomes a 6/6, and the Colossus deals 4.)

Now, one major negative to [Manaplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaplasm) (and [Chameleon Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus), I guess) is the distinct lack of trample. Both creatures are both pumpable and powerful, and yet they can be stymied by random chump-blockers. I considered [Primal Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Rage), but it was far more useless than useful. To prevent any losses to [The Hive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Hive) (which would definitely be a feat) I gave the nod to [Glarewielder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glarewielder). It costs the same amount of mana, outlaws potential blockers for your beasts, and has evoke (more on this in a bit.)

How's this for a combo: [Manaplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaplasm) + [Tower Above](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+Above)! Pay only three mana for the jaw dropping sorcery to turn [Manaplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaplasm) into an 11/11 trampling, withering, and provoking juggernaut! As awesome as that is, that interaction is 1-upped by [Sangrite Surge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sangrite+Surge), notorious Shards of Alara Limited bottomfeeder. The Surge turns [Manaplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaplasm) into a 10/10 double striker. Last I checked, that should be enough to win. And of course, now that we've committed to red, [Flame Javelin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin) is an obvious add (hello awesome removal!)
