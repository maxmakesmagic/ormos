Sometimes, finding an Arcana can be difficult, especially for the week leading up to previews. By this time, we've exhausted most of the obvious tidbits in cards and art. So, today, I went diving into Multiverse again looking for something to share with you all, and I think I've found something.


One of the strategies my predecessor on Arcana taught me was that it's really hard to do good **Magic** art because of the size constraints. Most people see the art in the tiny box on **Magic** cards, and the website is our opportunity to blow those up the art and show you some of the details that get lost at card size. This is something the creative team is well aware of and they review art both at full size and card size, to see how it looks. Art gets tweaked for this purpose.


Today, we're going to look at [Fate Unraveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Unraveler), a rare from *Born of the Gods*.


From Greek mythology, the Fates (or the Moirai) are three female beings who control the thread of life for every living being—even the gods, such as Zeus. This origin is taken quite literally in [Fate Unraveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Unraveler)—where she is pulling a thread from a tapestry of a seemingly doomed soldier's life.


Let's take a look at the art description from the creative team:


 



> Action: Show us a hag - keep the eye in the mouth. She is standing by three magical looms that she can pull threads from and inflict harm on the living - on each loom we can make out a picture of a hero. Although she's skinny, the hag should look powerful and dangerous.  
> 
> Focus: The hag.  
> 
> Mood: Creepy, dangerous, arcane.

[Fate Unraveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Unraveler) | Art by [David Palumbo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/search/default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22david%20palumbo%22%5D)


Now, if you caught it in the art description and in the larger art, that is an eye in her mouth. This is an example of one of the details that can be hard to make out at card size. The creative team knew this and so they added a special detail on the premium foil versions of the card to help people spot the eye in her mouth.
