T*he first round of this [Legends Bracket edition of You Decide!](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/youdecide_legendsbracket.asp) is over. Here's an overview of how the top seeds performed, and some commentary on the seemingly inevitable upsets.*


The seedings largely held true in the picturesque region of **[Tolaria](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/LegendBracketTolaria_R2.jpg)**, with only the fifteenth-seed [Tolsimir Wolfblood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolsimir+Wolfblood) scoring an upset over second-seeded [Sol'kanar the Swamp King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol%27kanar+the+Swamp+King). It remains to be seen if anything can get in the way of the mighty [Sliver Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen). Likewise, the only upset in **[Hammerheim](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/LegendBracketHammerheim_R2.jpg)** was [Ambassador Laquatus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambassador+Laquatus) taking his thirteenth seed and beating [Gerrard Capashen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard+Capashen) over the head with it. [Hammerheim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammerheim) still looks set for the glamorous Akroma-vs.-Phage quarterfinal matchup.


In **[Urborg](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/LegendBracketUrborg_R2.jpg)**, things were much more topsy-turvy; eleventh seed [Yosei, the Morning Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yosei%2C+the+Morning+Star) upset [Braids, Cabal Minion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Cabal+Minion) while seventh-seed [Darigaaz, the Igniter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darigaaz%2C+the+Igniter) lost to the tenth-seeded [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree) (and exactly how is it that a dragon named "the Igniter" couldn't finish off a tree in the first place? You'd think an all-wood opponent would be ideal). [Mirri, Cat Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirri%2C+Cat+Warrior) scored a mild upset from the ninth seed, vanquishing [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus), showing that while everybody enjoys a good Lady-of-Proper-Etiquette who's also a Giant Barbarian Slug, cat girls still rule the internet. We'll see what happens in the next round, though, as most experts expect [Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niv-Mizzet%2C+the+Firemind) to make short work of the Forestwalking Mirri.


Over in **[Pendelhaven](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/LegendBracketPendelhaven_R2.jpg)**, a massive upset sent first-seeded [Squee, Goblin Nabob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squee%2C+Goblin+Nabob) down for the count when [Cromat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cromat) somehow won. In fact, six of the eight results in [Pendelhaven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven) were upsets, including [Keiga, the Tide Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+the+Tide+Star) over [Phelddagrif](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phelddagrif); [Volrath the Fallen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath+the+Fallen) over [Nicol Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas); [Ascendant Evincar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascendant+Evincar) over [Ertai, Wizard Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ertai%2C+Wizard+Adept); [Mageta the Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mageta+the+Lion) over [Karn, Silver Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn%2C+Silver+Golem); and [Razia, Boros Archangel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razia%2C+Boros+Archangel) over [Dakkon Blackblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dakkon+Blackblade). With so much chaos, it looks like [Rith, the Awakener](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rith%2C+the+Awakener) might have an easy path to the Final Quatrain (sorry, had to use a non-trademarked phrase there), although Reya should provide a tough fight...
