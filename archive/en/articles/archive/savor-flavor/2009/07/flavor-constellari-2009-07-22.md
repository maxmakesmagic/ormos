Everyone's got their own favorite type of flavor text. Do I enjoy fun mage-driven trash-talk? Absolutely.

And I love me a pithy, poetic saying or quote any day.

> *—Elvish saying* ([Might of Oaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Oaks))
>

I like the world-building, expository flavor, too.

>

And like anybody, I love a grin-inducing zinger now and again.

But my absolute favorite type of flavor text is something I call the inexplicable brain-bomb. It's a piece of flavor text that *sounds* like an obscure reference to a preexisting character, world, or element of the multiverse, but whose referent doesn't actually exist anywhere in cards or continuity. It just asserts itself, tantalizing, leading, laden with promise of something cool but teasingly lacking in enough solid detail to tie down to a specific meaning.

> 
> 
> 


Flavor text like this lights a fuse in your imagination and just crackles away, your brain-wick ever-burning, never quite exploding into actual knowledge, but forever throwing sparks of imagery and creative potential that sizzle into your gray matter.

> *Only those gifted with the eye of Ugin, the spirit dragon, can see his fiery breath.* ([Ghostfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostfire))
>

Of all **Magic** sets, *Future Sight* was the king of the inexplicable brain-bomb. Just as its mechanics and game play were designed to showcase a range of possible **Magic** futures, many of which interacted in head-scratching ways with other mechanics in the block, its flavor text was created to evoke the feel of a variety of far-flung possible worlds and characters, providing a tapestry of [oddball flavor](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/futuresight2/lexicon) as counterpoint to the block's grim post-apocalyptic Dominarian setting.

Who are the Dweldian magi, and what is this strange Realm of Thrones afterlife which they avoid by being sucked into elementals of storm? What's up with this Ugin, the spirit dragon—when did he live, what's up with his invisible breath, and what exactly is meant by his "eye"? Who—or what—is this ominous Overmother, whose anatomy seems to bear only chillingly incomplete similarity to our own, and what mad beings would utter devoted prayers to it? Pieces like this light my brain-wick, sparking more questions than answers.


I. Love. That.


But *Future Sight's* not the only set with some inexplicable brain-bombs.

***Magic** 2010* is a blast of new cards with a classic fantasy feel, but it's also a fresh new batch of tantalizing loose ends of flavor. Who's this Xathrid, whose [Xathrid Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Xathrid%2BDemon) and [Acolyte of Xathrid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Acolyte%2Bof%2BXathrid) bring such pain to the living? Where is [Kalonian Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kalonian%2BBehemoth), and how does one avoid its blind, untouchable behemoths? Over a hundred new cards means many new pieces of flavor text, and you can find some inexplicable brain-bombs among them.


My two favorites in the set are on [Holy Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Holy+Strength) and [Unholy Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy+Strength). Art director Jeremy Jarvis commissioned new, mirrored artwork for the core set classics, and artist Terese Nielsen knocked it out of the park.

Fellow creative team writer Jenna Helland came up with the flavor text for these, inspired by the classical, "illuminated manuscript" look of Nielsen's art. I've been thinking about these prophetic pieces of prose, and the farsighted Constellari and their Codex, ever since.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf48_spellbook.jpg)To me they sound like a race of prophets, a nonhuman species cloaked in mystery, honored and exalted by all who dwell in the plane around them for their stunning accuracy at predicting the events of the future. In my head they're a tiny minority, only a few thousand in number, but more real and palpable than remote gods—a living religion.


When the Constellari came and codified their visions into the Codex, they lifted the world out of a time of shadow, bringing good harvests and an end to bitter war. The world's horrors were driven back, and the people flourished. The people hailed the Constellari as saints, and trusted their utterances as law, and gave them authority as year counters, grain blessers, and prayer poets. Their uncanny accuracy removed all doubt in their origins or purposes, and for a long while the plane thrived in unity.


But it's hard for the human mind to embrace another's judgment so completely. Skeptics wondered what force could predict so perfectly. And some found chinks in their wall of perfect truth.

All of you who followed the *Shards of Alara* block storyline probably suspect—and all of you who read *Alara Unbroken* know—that I'm fascinated by prophecy, and false prophecy in particular. There's something so hopeful in the idea of the ability to see the future—so many of our lives' woes would seem to be avoidable if we could remove the future from its shroud of mystery. **Magic** of this kind would be so comforting, so powerful—either you can see the doom heading your way in time to evade it, or you already know in advance that things are going to work out okay. And yet prophecy, ultimately, is limiting; it cuts off possibilities that may have once existed, reducing a fanning delta of choices down to a one-way stream of bounded history. I think that's why so much fantasy literature centers on prophecy—it's tantalizingly hopeful, yet causes our human will to rebel, focusing the spotlight on our need for a free future. We yearn for freedom even at the price of perfection.


All that I'm getting from a couple of core set Auras? Yeah. That's the inexplicable brain-bomb for you.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf48_merfolkCross.jpg)Good eye, James! Yes, M10 shows a bit of a different look for merfolk, a creature with finned legs instead of the fish-tail, a creature no longer bound to water. It was a coordinated effort between us and the artists. Lorwyn and Shadowmoor Blocks showed us that, if we were going to do a lot of merfolk all at once, we needed to be able to show them in a large variety of settings—the first few underwater shots were fine, but the riverbank shots, and the wells, and the other methods for showing merfolk interacting with dry-land folk—it got hacky pretty fast, to us. This, plus the conceptual difficulty of imagining fish-people attacking on the same battlefield as minotaurs and elephants and whatnot, was hindering our ability to actually do merfolk in sets. We asked these artists to give us a shot at legged merfolk so that we could show them in a greater variety of settings.
