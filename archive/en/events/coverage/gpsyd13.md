Zhang Shreds Sydney!
====================




January 19-20, 2013












GRAND PRIX SYDNEY 2013
----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsyd13/Winner_final.jpg)Few would have picked Melbourne's Allen Zhang to win this power packed Top 8, but armed with his lightning-fast Rakdos deck, he made short work of Martin Jůza in the quarterfinals. Jůza was looking to be the first person to win a Grand Prix in four continents, but he'll have another chance later this year at GP Brisbane.


Zhang then faced New Zealand's Zen Takahashi in the semifinals, besting the feisty 15 year-old with his Shred-Freaks in 3 games, to go through to the finals to face one of Australia's finest mages, Justin Cheung.


Cheung's deck was almost perfectly suited to foil Zhang's aggressive beaters, but having watched Cheung wreck Tomoharu Saito in the semifinals with [Electrickery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrickery) and [Izzet Staticaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Staticaster), Zhang played play around them perfectly, quickly and forcefully giving Cheung yet another second place finish for his resume.


Congratulations to Allen Zhang, the 2013 Grand Prix Sydney Champion!
