 **Q:**  How can I get cards signed by members of R&D? 
**A: Trick Jarrett, Editor-in-Chief of DailyMTG.com**


This is a fairly common question for the members of R&D. It's a pretty simple thing to do, though!


Include in the mailing:


* Cards to be signed
* A Self-Addressed Stamped Envelope
* Any special requests (which may or may not be honored)

Then mail it all to:


[Person's Name]  
 c/o Wizards of the Coast  
 1600 Lind Ave. SW  
 Renton, WA 98055


And it's as simple as that!
