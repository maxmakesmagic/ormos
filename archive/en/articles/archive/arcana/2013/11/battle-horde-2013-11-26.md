Have you recovered from the *Theros* Game Day? You know, where you faced down the Hydra? We got a lot of awesome feedback from people who took part in it, and we're excited to tell you all that we've got a new, though similar, challenge lined up for the *Born of the Gods* Game Day! 


 The sixth challenge on the [Hero's Path](http://www.mtgherospath.com) is to "Battle the Horde" on March 1-2, 2014, at the *Born of the Gods* Game Day!
