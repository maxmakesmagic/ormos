Where to Find Commander (2019 Edition) Previews
===============================================



 Posted in **Feature**

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






For the *Commander (2019 Edition)* preview season—which is almost here!—we're going to help you follow along with everything coming on every day by giving you the outlets we have planned for each day.


The goal is to not only help you find what you're looking for every day, but also to avoid engaging in leaks (which hopefully don't happen, knock on wood) if you so choose.


So below, you'll find a list of dates as well as the outlets that will have previews on that date. Once the previews are live, we'll update this very article so you can easily find every card. If a link simply goes to the front of a website or social media site, that means they probably haven't previewed the card yet.


This time around, we're giving each deck its own spotlight day. So, if you see a card previewed on August 5, that means it's part of the same deck as all other cards previewed on August 5! We'll also be posting full decklists.


And if you just want to see all the cards that have been officially previewed in one place, you can always check out our Card Image Gallery (going live Monday morning). Note that the CIG is updated every morning, so it contains all cards previewed the previous day (and earlier), but not the day of. For the most up-to-date listings, you can check this page!


So bookmark this page and check back regularly. *Commander 2019* previews start tomorrow at Gen Con!


August 1–4
==========


**Gen Con**


Many of these previews will be happening live, on-site at Gen Con. Watch [@Wizards\_Magic](http://www.twitter.com/wizards_magic) or any places fans normally share card previews. We'll be sharing more than a dozen cards over the weekend, so keep an eye out!


August 5–8
==========


Every day at 3 p.m. PT, [The Command Zone](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsiaNUb42gRAP7ewbJ0ecQ) will show off everything not already previewed for each deck, and we'll post the full decklist for that deck here on DailyMTG. That's right—every day you'll get the full picture of what each deck contains!
