The first visit to Zendikar was six years ago, way back in 2009 when we were young, Extended was still a format, the power of landfall was unknown, and Brian Kibler was not yet in the Hall of Fame.


All of that changed, however, with the first Pro Tour centered on a set based in Zendikar—in this case, the original itself, *Zendikar.*


At [Pro Tour Austin in 2009](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptaus09/welcome), what would now probably be called Pro Tour *Zendikar*, Brian Kibler returned to *Magic* and took home the trophy that would eventually help propel him into the Hall of Fame.  
  

The format was Extended (a now-defunct rotating format sitting kind of where Modern now sits), and the power of *Zendikar* was felt immediately—as enemy color fetch lands transformed the format and [Plated Geopede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Geopede) and [Steppe Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx) started blitzing players left and right.


So as we visit Zendikar once more, take a trip back to the first battle over Zendikar, and then tune in this weekend on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) and right here on [DailyMTG.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/articles).
