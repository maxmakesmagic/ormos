Did you know there are symbols associated with each of the Poleis in *Theros*? They were designed by [Adam Paquette](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Adam%20Paquette%22%5D) when he was doing concept art for the set. There isn't a specific explanation as to what each symbol means or represents for the polis, except that it was felt each captured the spirit and feeling of their represented polis.
