With the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings still very much coming under the heading of "new look" as the 2015-2016 season gets under way, it's time to see what impact the Grand Prix in Hong Kong (Limited) and San Diego (Standard) have had on our leaderboard. The tremendous performance of Mike Sigrist at Pro Tour *Magic Origins*—which secured him the Player of the Year title—continues to see him at No. 1, ahead of Eric Froehlich. Below the recent Player of the Year protagonists, however, there was a lot of volatility this week.


The biggest change among the three upward movers went to Paul Rietzl. The Hall of Famer finished third, and had the best performance out of the ten players from the ranks of the Top 25 who attended Grand Prix San Diego. That sees him up five spots at No. 3. Jacob Wilson fell just short of the Top 8 in San Diego, but still moves up four places to No. 11, now just behind fellow Canadian Shaun McLaren. Meanwhile, Matt Sperling, fresh off his second Pro Tour Top 8 in Vancouver, advances four spots up the charts to land at No. 16 this week.


Despite there being only three risers on the chart, a full dozen saw their stock fall this week. Pro Tour Champions Ari Lax and Antonio Del Moral León both fell three, to No. 9 and No. 18 respectively. Ondrej Strasky and Andrew Cuneo are also down three, although Cuneo had the presumably bittersweet satisfaction of seeing his extraordinary Blue-Red Mill creation take down Grand Prix San Diego in the hands of Michael Majors.


In Hong Kong, the Top 25 was represented by two-time Player of the Year Yuuya Watanabe and Lee Shi Tian, who was looking to make his mark on home turf. By normal standards, both had good weekends. Watanabe finished 19th, while Lee Shi Tian had a creditable 33rd place on the weekend. Neither of these performances were good enough to propel either player higher on our chart. One man who did manage to move up, however, was Pro Tour Hall of Famer Ben Stark, who returns to the rankings at No. 25 after yet another rock-solid GP finish in San Diego.


Next we're off to London and Detroit for another double header of Grand Prix goodness, so join us next week for all the news from the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings*.*
