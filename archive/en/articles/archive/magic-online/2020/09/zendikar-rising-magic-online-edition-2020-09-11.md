Zendikar Rising: Magic Online Edition

*Zendikar Rising* is almost upon us, and that means it's time to talk about lots of new things in the world of *Magic Online*. In just a few short days—less than a week!—we're all going to be queuing up to party!


(I used to give articles clever names. For *Battle for Zendikar*, I used the portmanteau "zendikarticle," and that was wonderful. For this one, I would have gone with "Zee-Enn-Article," because, you know, the set code for this set is "ZNR." Alas, the convention of "[Set Name]: *Magic Online* Edition" is better for the search engines, and these articles are often commonly referenced.)


We're going to be taking the system down on Wednesday, September 16. As normal, this is planned to start around 9 a.m. Pacific time (UTC-7) and last until noon Pacific time. When we come up, you'll see a few changes immediately:


* All legalities are updated. Standard will rotate out everything prior to *Throne of Eldraine*, and all the reprints will be Standard-legal once again. Welcome back, Lotus Cobra!
* The treasure chest will be updated. Some *Zendikar Rising* cards will be found inside, so if you see someone with a card a day or two early, don't be alarmed: they were probably just saving up their treasure chests. The full update details can be found at the Treasure Chest page [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info), and will be updated on September 14.

*Zendikar Rising* Redemption Schedule
-------------------------------------


* *Zendikar Rising* redemption will begin on October 14.
* The availability guarantee for *Zendikar Rising* redemption will expire on December 30. After that, redemption will only be available as supplies last.
* *Zendikar Rising* redemption will end entirely on February 3, 2021.
* As a reminder: *Core Set 2021* redemption's availability guarantee will be ending on October 7, and that set will no longer be redeemable at all after November 11. (These dates were originally announced in [that set's *Magic Online* article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/core-set-2021-magic-online-edition-2020-06-19).)

'Cause We Like To Party (Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey)
======================================================


The party mechanic in *Zendikar Rising* represents the strength and size of your adventuring party. In game, it's a complex way to track numbers from 0 to 4. It's that complexity that makes it important to have a lot of information on hand, so we created a small collapsible tracker on the battlefield that tracks the things you need to know.


There's an avatar on the battlefield in these screenshots. It's called the "Avatar of Congress" (long story), and it's an internal testing tool. It helps developers, QA, product managers, and anyone else with a need to set up specific game states quickly and easily. It's not a gameplay element at all, so even though you may not have ever seen it before, rest assured that you aren't missing anything.


For you, it'll appear only if you have a party creature type represented on the battlefield while having a card that cares about the size of your party (or having a full party) in your deck. On your opponent's side of the board, it'll appear only once you see that they've got a card that cares about party in their deck; this could happen when they play one of those cards, when you look at their hand and see one, or anything else that gives you this new information.


What you'll see starts off small and unassuming. It's just a little box with "Party" and a number in it.


![party tracker 1](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/party%20tracker%201.jpg)


But wait, there's more! If you click the attached arrow, the little box will expand and you'll see a breakdown of each of the four party creature types. For each of those types, you'll see how many creatures on that side of the battlefield have that creature type.


![party tracker 2](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/party%20tracker%202.jpg)


This gets a little more complicated when you have a single creature with multiple types: whether it's Tajuru Paragon, Mothdust Changeling, or even the obscure Wandering Mage. They'll increment all relevant lines, even though they can only count toward one creature for your party. So, if you have that Tajuru Paragon . . .


![party tracker 3](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/party%20tracker%203.jpg)


Why might you care about those numbers, independent of the party-size tracker? Well, if you've got a removal spell in your hand and want to knock your opponent off a full party, you can quickly tell if that'll be possible. If one of the party creature types has a 1 next to it, you just need to destroy that single creature to prevent your opponent's Squad Commander from making their whole team indestructible.


Think of it this way: each line is calculated separately. The "Party" line at the top isn't just "how many creature types are represented," it's "how large does the game of *Magic* think my party is?" The specific type lines, on the other hand, are simple answers to "how many of this creature type does this player control?"

*Zendikar Rising* Avatars
=========================


New *Magic Online* accounts, and any account that purchases the Deck Builder's Essentials, will receive this exclusive (and tradeable) "Planeswalking to Zendikar" avatar:


![Planeswalking to Zendikar avatar](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/znr-avatar-1.png)


The Prestige Avatars for this set will be using the now-familiar system: players get five points for each Competitive Trophy and one point for every Friendly trophy. At the end of a season (when the next Standard-legal set releases), players with 40 or more points will get this mythic rare Nahiri, Heir of the Ancients avatar. Players with 20 or more points get the gold-bordered Nissa of Shadowed Boughs avatar, and anyone with five or more points gets the Jace, Mirror Mage avatar. Prestige Avatars are never tradeable.


![Jace, Nissa, and Nahiri avatars](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/znr-avatar-2.png)


If you're looking for tradeable avatars, though, you're in luck. There are *three* found in Treasure Chests this time around!


Everyone's favorite returning Snake, Lotus Cobra!

The Mouse in the house that's captured hearts with his cute fuzzy parts: Canyon Jerboa!

Alternative Play Calendar
=========================


This season is going to have something for everyone! It's a long season, so there's plenty of room for exciting new things! One thing to note: this is a high-level overview of what's to come. Most events will have more details coming later, as the event nears.


* September 16–October 7: ***Modern Cube*** – Back with a new iteration, we're going to launch ZNR side by side this beloved cube's return. (Don't forget to check out the update article going live next Monday!)
* October 7–14: ***Mystery Booster***: ***Magic Online* Edition**! Constructed to be a mostly faithful replication of the Retail edition. Mostly. We worked closely with game designer and original product architect Gavin Verhey to make some small tweaks for the *Magic Online* release. Full details to come closer to that event release.
* October 14–21: A **brand-new Cube Spotlight** debuts in this time slot. The designer will tell us all about it when we get closer.
* October 21–28: Supreme Draft returns, but 'tis the season, so this time, we're headed to Innistrad! Visiting Ravnica in July was good, but late October is when we get spooky.
* October 28–November 4: One of my favorite *Magic Online* traditions is that we run **Triple *Innistrad*** **Draft** for Halloween each year. Spawn those Spiders and Prepare for those Travels, because we're going to be drafting like it's 2011. (Oh, also, we'll be putting out a little product called *Commander Legends* this weekend. Lots to say on that later.)
* November 4–18: ***Vintage Masters* Flashback**s return for two weeks, and we can all rejoice. Maybe this will be the time that I finally succeed at drafting more than three [Battle Screech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech)es in the same deck. (Narrator: Deep down, she knew she was setting herself up for disappointment.)
* November 18–25: We've mentioned this before, how it's coming "probably in late November," and so this is it: the week for our first **Supreme Chaos Draft**.
* November 25–December 2: A popular entry in the Cube Spotlight Series, this week will see the return of Kyle O'Neill's ***Core Set Cube***, updated through *Core Set 2021*!
* December 2–9: **Chaos Draft: *Masters*** launches. Imagine some of your favorite *Masters* sets all jumbled up into a single wild Draft experience. Then imagine that you can draft it for a whole week. That week is here, in early December.
* December 9–16: For the second time this season, we're going to debut a **brand-new Cube Spotlight**! And of course, we'll hear more about this one from the designer when we're close to launch.
* December 16–23: ***Vintage Cube* Supreme**. The *Vintage Cube* returns for the winter holidays, and for this first week, we're going to Supreme Draft it. Instead of ridiculously powerful decks like normal *Vintage Cube*, we'll play with *ridiculous-er-ly* powerful decks! And then . . .
* December 23 – the launch of *Kaldheim*: ***Vintage Cube***. It's a classic, beloved experience for a reason. And we'll be running it for a while, starting on December 23.
