![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/tcg/products/worldwake/WWK_Logo_325.jpg)A Planeswalker has escaped from *Worldwake* and we need your help!

This Planeswalker has left clues scattered all around Earth—*our* plane!—in the form of pieces of his or her own Planeswalker card from *Worldwake* hidden in eight different WPN locations. Beginning Monday, December 14 and continuing for four days, we will post the latitude and longitude of two of the pieces each day. We encourage you to seek out the piece of the card and participate in the global jigsaw puzzle to put the card back together. Together, we can track down this Planeswalker!

Be sure to return every day starting Monday, December 14 and see if that day's pieces might be hidden in your neighborhood. And on Friday, 12/18 get together at your local WPN location and discuss the results (and, if all goes well, the complete *Worldwake* card) at Friday Night Magic. Good luck. Now go get that Planeswalker!

Today we reveal the first two of the eight locations of the Planeswalker's trail. We know that the Planeswalker has left two pieces of a *Worldwake* card in two separate WPN locations. Here are the coordinates:


 #1 30.324743 Lat, -97.743041 Long  
 #2 50.848563 Lat, 4.365096 Long


Come back tomorrow to see the pieces that were found and get tomorrow's location coordinates. Happy hunting.
