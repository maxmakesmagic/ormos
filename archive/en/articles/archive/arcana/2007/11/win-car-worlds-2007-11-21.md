In less than three weeks, one **Magic** player will be leaving the World Championships in [a new car](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/worlds-07winacar)!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/tournamentcenter/2007/worlds_car4.jpg)*2007 Toyota FJ Cruiser, shown with removable Magic-themed wrap (photo courtesy Toyota of Manhattan).*If you want a shot at a 2007 Toyota FJ Cruiser, there are nine public events at Worlds on December 6-8 to qualify you for the "Win a Car" tournament. Whether your strength is Constructed, Limted, or Team, there's an event for you. Finish in the top two and you're moving on to the "Win a Car" tournament, a 32-person Standard event on Sunday, December 9 at Worlds.


Along with the coveted slots in the "Win a Car" tournament, each qualifier event features great prizes like 160 GB iPods, a Garmin Street Pilot, an iPhone, original **Magic** art, an 80 GB Arcos Media Player, a Microsoft Zune, and a set of premium foil *Lorwyn* cards.


The best thing is you don't have to be qualified to play in any of these nine tournaments. Just show up at Worlds and get into the game!


Listed below is the complete schedule of car qualifier events. For a complete list of Worlds Public Events, click [here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/worlds-07publicevents).
