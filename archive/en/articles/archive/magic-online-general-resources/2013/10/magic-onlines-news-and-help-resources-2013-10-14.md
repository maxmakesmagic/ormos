The *Magic Online*  Newsletter contains a wealth of personalized information you can't find anywhere else. Published monthly, the newsletter is a quick snapshot of your *Magic Online*  history, and a top news and announcements list of info you shouldn't miss.

* Current MOCS season qualifier points
* A personalized factoid


The factoid is a very cool feature that gives you a look at your play habits and choices from a data perspective. For example, a recent factoid listed your three most underdrafted common cards from *Magic 2015*. These factoids might surprise you, or even inspire new thinking or suggest new strategies.
