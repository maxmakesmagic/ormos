A three-card deck? Yep. The very first "best deck" in **Magic**'s history was a burn deck. With the rules still being hammered out for the game, the very first decks played by the best players abused powerful card interactions to win on the first turn, every time. How? The burn combo was simple: cast a [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) or two, sacrifice them for mana, use [Channel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel) to turn your life total into more mana, and cast [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) for lethal. How could you guarantee you got to go off every time? Back then the mulligan rule allowed you to re-draw a hand of seven cards if you didn't have any lands in your opening hand (provided you revealed your hand to your opponent). Because you weren't playing any lands, you always got to start with the hand you wanted! Burn decks have come a long way.
