Commander is a blast and [the recently announced *Commander (2015 Edition)*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/announcing-magic-gathering-commander-2015-2015-08-05) is sure to be awesome. While there aren’t many things that are more fun than leading an army of creatures into battle with a Legend at the forefront, we’ve come up with a great new way to play on *Magic Online* for anyone who’s a fan of *Magic*’s most powerful creatures and game-changing spells, all wrapped up in one legendary package. Today, we’re happy to announce the *Legendary Cube*, coming to *Magic Online* on November 18, 2015!

You might have guessed it from the name, but for the initial run of the *Legendary Cube*, every creature will be legendary. When legendary creatures enter the battlefield, they are an immediate threat, possessing effects so powerful that they can alter the fundamental rules of *Magic*. In this Cube dominated by legendaries, a clash of titans—legendary against legendary—will be the most effective way to battle, comboing together huge splashy effects into an overwhelming onslaught against your opponent. The drastically different take on play style isn't the only thing that sets this Cube apart from our current Cubes in rotation—this time around you'll be able to win cards from the Cube for your collection.

That’s the *Legendary Cube* Prize Pack. Traditionally, Cube Drafts have not awarded prizes outside of points that you can use as entry into another event. We’ll still be awarding Play Points with the *Legendary Cube*, but if you play well enough, you’ll also be rewarded with *Legendary Cube* Prize Packs that contains six cards from a selection of 150 *Legendary Cube* cards.


*Legendary Cube* Prize Packs will have cards from the newly released *Commander (2015 Edition)*, as well as *Commander (2014 Edition)*, *Commander (2013 Edition)*, *Magic the Gathering Commander*, *Conspiracy*, *Planechase (2012 Edition)*, and *Commander's Arsenal* sets (the 56 cards included from *Commander 2015* will make up the vast majority of the ones that are new to *Magic Online*). These are all multiplayer products, but non-Commander players will find sought-after cards in Prize Packs that will help in Legacy and Vintage play too. Prize Packs won’t be purchasable in the store and won’t be tradeable, so the only way to get them will be to play the new *Legendary Cube* Draft. Rest assured, the cards contained within Prize Packs will be tradeable, as normal.


We’ll keep players updated with more details about the cards included in the *Legendary Cube*, event details, and Prize Pack contents as we get closer to release!
