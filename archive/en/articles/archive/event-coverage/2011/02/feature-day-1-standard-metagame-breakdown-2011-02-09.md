Four hundred eighty-three players were at **Magic** Weekend Paris to showcase the new Standard format during Day 1 of competition. Would we see mostly decks from the past or would *Mirrodin Besieged* spark something new from the minds of these talented Pro Tour competitors?

[Valakut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut) Ramp decks topped the list with 105 players. Fueled by green mana acceleration spells like [Harrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow), [Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) and [Khalni Heart Expedition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Heart+Expedition), this deck finished its opponents with [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) and its namesake card [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle).


The second most popular choice on the day was Blue-black Control. One hundred competitors paired [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) with some of the more efficient black removal from *Mirrodin Besieged*: [Go for the Throat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) and Black Sun Zenith. [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas) was even seen making more than a splash in some versions.


Third on our list is another familiar face. Caw-Go prevailed as the Blue-white deck of choice as 67 deck lists sported a full set of [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk). Both [Sword of Body and Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Body+and+Mind) and the *Mirrodin Besieged*Â [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) made appearances in builds containing [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic).


We rounded out the top 5 archetypes with two aggressive creature decks. Thirty-six players toted a variety of Vampires builds while 34 competitors piloted the explosive Kuldotha Red deck. With cards such as [Pulse Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+Tracker), [Viscera Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer) and [Kalastria Highborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn) for Vampires and [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and [Kuldotha Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Rebirth) for Kuldotha Red, these two decks exemplified how synergy outshined individual card quality.


These were only the top 5 archetypes here in Paris. Five more archetypes accounted for upward of five percent of the field each, including [Quest for the Holy Relic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quest+for+the+Holy+Relic), Boros , Red-Blue-Green Control, traditional Blue-White Control and Green-White Aggro. Sixteen more archetypes made up over 50 rogue lists. Which of these decks would we see on Day 2? Find out in Friday's coverage.
