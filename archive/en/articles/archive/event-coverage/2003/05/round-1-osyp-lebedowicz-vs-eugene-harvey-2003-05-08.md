When the pairings went up for the first round, Osyp was in disbelief. He checked once more, and sure enough he had to face CMU/Togit teammate Eugene Harvey. Lebedowicz is fresh off a victory at Pro Tour Venice, which was his second Sunday appearance in a Constructed Pro Tour. This is the last Masters ever, but it's also Constructed, which means Osyp should have a good shot at doing well. With the CMU/Togit powerhouse behind him, he came to Yokohama with [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), while Harvey is running [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog).

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a398.jpg)Lebedowicz went first, playing [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb). Harvey's [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) revealed [Crumbling Sanctuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Sanctuary), [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo), [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), island and [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb)- the Dynamo headed to the graveyard. Lebedowicz simply played lands for a few turns, while Harvey dug into his deck with [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge). [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) was [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed, and Lebedowicz paid three mana.

A second [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) was countered with Lebedowicz's Leak, allowing the artifact to resolve. Harvey tapped all his mana on upkeep, drew, and cast [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). The piles presented were [Polluted Delta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta)/island/swamp and [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)/[Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress); Harvey took the two card pile. He then played a swamp and used the [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), seeing [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and [Crumbling Sanctuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Sanctuary), sending the counterspell to the graveyard. Without much else to do, Lebedowicz played [Crumbling Sanctuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Sanctuary), and [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port). He would need to draw a threat soon while the [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) was still holding down Harvey's lands.

Once again, Harvey tapped his lands on upkeep and cast [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). The piles presented were [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)/[Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) and [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)/[Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)/island; Harvey took the two card pile. Eventually the [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) faded away, and Harvey used [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) to get three [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge). This put him up four cards, and gave him even more control over the game. At this point, Lebedowicz had to go for it.

He used Port on his turn to tap down one of Harvey's lands. [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) was [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)ed, leaving Harvey with one blue mana untapped. This gave [Phyrexian Processor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Processor) a good chance to resolve, but Harvey played [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) in response, followed by [Thwart](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thwart). Harvey summoned a very threatening [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) which allowed [Phyrexian Processor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Processor) to resolve, but Harvey simply used [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to get [Capsize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Capsize), bounce the Sanctuary, and attack for the win.

### Game 2

Lebedowicz started off with [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port). Harvey's [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) revealed [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port), [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire), [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) and [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)- [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) went to the graveyard. Lebedowicz complained, since he was the one who told Harvey to play [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) came out on turn two, and Harvey cast [Powder Keg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Powder+Keg). [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) left Harvey tapped out, and Lebedowicz took advantage of the situation, playing [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) and [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire).

Harvey tapped his mana on upkeep, and used [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to get [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). [Phyrexian Processor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Processor) resolved easily, and Osyp set it to 10/10. Harvey added a counter to [Powder Keg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Powder+Keg) to bring it to two, and played a second Keg. Under [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) he played [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) on upkeep again getting [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). 

A token was made, and attacked for ten. Harvey took the damage, and would be able to kill all tokens and the Processor at once next turn with both Kegs. Lebedowicz tapped [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) and went to take cards off his library, until he realized he didn't have [Crumbling Sanctuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Sanctuary) in play; that was last game. This got him a warning.

![Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Upheaval)He tapped all his resources and cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), playing [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) and the Processor, this time on five. [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) revealed lands, [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire), and Harvey sent [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) to the graveyard. Lebedowicz played [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port), and on upkeep tapped mana to activate the Port on Harvey's land and make a 5/5. He had [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) to stop [Powder Keg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Powder+Keg) on the following turn, and forced a third game.Lebedowicz- 1 Harvey- 1 

### Game 3

Lebedowicz had a first turn [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key). [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) revealed Dynamo, Processor, [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Rising Waters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rising+Waters) and two [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port)s- Harvey sent [Rising Waters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rising+Waters) to the graveyard. [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) was countered with [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul). Harvey cast [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) to get two [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) and [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul). Lebedowicz laughed, and gave Harvey the Knowledge.

With three Ports in play, Lebedowicz would be in a good position to force spells through when he got the mana. Harvey played [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) to draw four cards, and summoned [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). This left him tapped out, and Lebedowicz played [Urza's Blueprints](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Blueprints). Harvey fed a Knowledge to his [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), used [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to get it back, and was able to fuel his [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) to lethal damage.

**Final Result:** Lebedowicz- 1 Harvey- 2
