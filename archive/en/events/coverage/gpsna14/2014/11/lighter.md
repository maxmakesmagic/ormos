 There's some great camaraderie going around here, and some great fun. There's so much awesome *Magic* going on, it's easy to get lost in the shuffle of cards. So I thought we'd just take a look at the lighter side of Grand Prix San Antonio for a minute.



For example, here's a group of players representing Top Deck Gaming Center here in San Antonio. I thought they might have been some local ringers I'd yet to meet based on their wear, until I saw "Team Super Casual" embroidered on the front of the shirts right above each of the individual names.
