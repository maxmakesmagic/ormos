We'd like to tell you about Markus Staeheli. He's a **Magic** collector. And, no offense, he's way better at it than you. That's a pretty bold claim, but he's done something that doesn't even sound possible.

He's put together a complete set of Beta. And every single card is signed by the artist.

There are 302 cards. There are 25 individual artists. Sure, if you can find [Dan Frazier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=%5B%22Limited%20Edition%20Beta%22%5D&artist=+%5B%22Dan%20Frazier%22%5D), [Anson Maddocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=%5B%22Limited%20Edition%20Beta%22%5D&artist=+%5B%22Anson%20Maddocks%22%5D), and [Doug Shuler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=%5B%22Limited%20Edition%20Beta%22%5D&artist=+%5B%22Doug%22%5D) all in one place and in a good mood, you can probably knock off all 98 cards in a shot. But what about Fay Jones, the artist for [Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=http%3A%2F%2Fgatherer.wizards.com%2FPages%2FCard%2FDetails.aspx%3Fmultiverseid%3D423)?

Anyway, Markus has very kindly sent along some pictures of the collection. Look upon his works, ye mighty, and despair. And then click any section to zoom in.
