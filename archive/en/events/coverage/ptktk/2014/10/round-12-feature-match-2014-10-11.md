 When discussing the resumes of successful *Magic* players, putting values on certain finishes can be harder than it sounds. Hong Kong's Lee Shi Tian has 4 Grand Prix Top 8s and 2 Pro Tour Top 8s, doubling Shaun McLaren on both counts, but McLaren won the Pro Tour he made Top 8 in, and that counts for a lot.




 So how best to settle this? Over a good ol' game of *Magic: The Gathering*, of course!




 McLaren brought with him to the table a Jeskai Wins deck with less [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) than most, and a little more removal, while Lee Shi Tian brought with him a variation on the [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) combo deck designed by the Hong Kong *Magic* community they like to call "Umbrella Revolution."



Lee's plan is relatively straight forward, given how complicated it is, he's looking to assemble his combo and kill McLaren in a single turn. McLaren either has to provide a lot of pressure on Lee to perhaps force him to try and combo off prematurely, or to disrupt him sufficiently by keeping his mana creatures off the table.




*While Shaun McLaren went for the more traditional approach to Jeskai in Standard, Lee Shi Tian has access to some green, with the focal point of his Jeskai cards revolving around [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy).*
