When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he wanted a job making Magic cards. Ten years later, his dream was realized as his combined success as a professional player, deck builder, and writer brought him into Wizards R&D during 2011. He's been writing Magic articles since 2005 and has no plans to stop. 





The hive's grasp is strong... and even I can't avoid it. I've been wanting to talk about a Sliver deck ever since ***Magic** 2014*  was announced—and this week, I finally have that opportunity. 

Today, we're going to take a look at a Slivers deck sent in by Antonio. Let's have at it:

The ability for each of your attackers to ping something in such an aggressive deck can be very strong in any kind of creature stall situation or for when your opponent is trying to mount a blocking defense. If you have a large board of Slivers in multiples it can be particularly brutal.

 ...However, if you *do* have a large board of Slivers and land a [Thorncaster Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thorncaster+Sliver), how much better is that going to be than a [Megantic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megantic+Sliver) (for just a mana more) or another Sliver you could have cast earlier? If you are in a position where you could cast a second one and have enough Slivers to make it good, that's already a fairly dominating position. 

 With that said, I do want to still play one copy. The difference between zero and one is huge, especially in a Sliver deck where eventually finding a card that can grants a specific ability to everybody can be all that matters. And with [Garruk, Caller of Beasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Caller+of+Beasts) in our deck, we have a reasonable chance of finding our one if the game drags on. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Battle+Sliver)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Sliver) As I mentioned earlier, pumping power is what you ideally want your stat-enhancing Slivers to be doing. [Battle Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Sliver) also stacks, which is lovely. While a five-mana 5/3 isn't exactly very exciting, when it also comes with a +2/+0 bonus to your entire team it can be a game changer. I don't want to draw a ton of five-drops, but I do want to see one of these if I can—I'm happy with three. 

 Why is [Battle Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Sliver) preferable over [Thorncaster Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thorncaster+Sliver)? Not only is the extra power and larger base body nice bonus, but you really want cards to make double strike be particularly brutal. Why is double strike relevant, you may ask? Well, there's a Sliver for that... 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bonescythe+Sliver)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonescythe+Sliver) Double strike is one of the most powerful abilities you can grant to all of your creatures. Suddenly, they're all hitting for double damage and hard to deal with in combat. While the ability on [Bonescythe Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonescythe+Sliver) doesn't stack, it's powerful enough that I absolutely want to play four. You want to find one every game if you can, and as long as you keep one on the battlefield you should be in good shape. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hive+Stirrings)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Stirrings) Three mana for two 1/1s isn't a great deal... but when they're 4/2s with double strike, suddenly that sounds a lot more appealing! [Hive Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Stirrings) does exactly that. One of the cards that helps you amass a strong Sliver army, [Hive Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Stirrings) puts out two more creatures you can turn into potent threats. Four is definitely right here. 

 It's also worth noting that curving [Manaweft Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaweft+Sliver) into [Hive Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Stirrings) is very strong, leaving you with six mana producers by the end of your third turn! That's a play to look out for. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Megantic+Sliver)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megantic+Sliver) This deck has a curious balance in its mana curve. It wants a lot of cheap Slivers so it can start attacking early and to make [Manaweft Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaweft+Sliver) shine. It also wants some expensive cards to cast if [Manaweft Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaweft+Sliver) lives. At the same time, it can't have too many expensive cards in case you don't draw [Manaweft Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaweft+Sliver) or if it dies. 

 There's only so much room for six drops considering the deck already has slower cards at both four and five, and I like how Antonio chose to play three six drops. You will often see one if the game goes a little long, but you'll seldom be flooded on them. While +3/+3 to all of your creatures is certainly strong, out of those two I'd rather flip-flop them to make it two Garruks and one [Megantic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megantic+Sliver). It's nice to have one Sliver overrun around so you can craft around it if you draw it or to dig for with Garruk, but Garruk is just so strong here (more on that later) that I'd like to play a second. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Frontline+Medic)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frontline+Medic) In a deck built around Slivers, there has to be a pretty compelling reason to deviate from playing all Slivers as your creatures. While [Frontline Medic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frontline+Medic) is certainly a good card, it doesn't work that well with the Sliver theme. I imagine there's one copy in the decklist so that if the game went really long you could find your one-of and attack without fear—but that situation is so rare that it's not worth playing a card you will normally just draw and be disappointed by. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Garruk%2C+Caller+of+Beasts)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Caller+of+Beasts) In a heavy Sliver deck, you have to pick and choose your non-Sliver cards very carefully. Especially at six mana, which buys you [Megantic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megantic+Sliver), what makes me want to go for Garruk? 

Well, in a deck as full of creatures as this one, Garruk's +1 is going to net you quite a few cards. To compound the power further, all of those creatures are Slivers—meaning Garruk is actively helping you create a monstrous board presence.

 Furthermore, Garruk's ultimate is brutal in a Sliver deck. If you use [Manaweft Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaweft+Sliver) to power out an early Garruk, your opponent might not be in a position to deal with it—meaning you can threaten ultimate. 

 As I mentioned earlier, I like two Garruks here along with the one [Megantic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megantic+Sliver). It's not good in every draw, but with three total six drops you have a reasonable chance of finding one when you really need to. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Creeping+Renaissance)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Renaissance)[Creeping Renaissance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Renaissance) is a pretty cute one-of. Even if all of your Slivers die off, this brings them all back from the Sliver graveyard to recast. This is a reasonable sideboard card in attrition-heavy matchups or against board sweepers. 

Main deck, I'd rather just try and make the Sliver angle as strong as possible and then you could use a sideboard for your metagame to tweak against whatever you would expect to face.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Boros+Charm)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) Similar to [Creeping Renaissance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Renaissance), it's a nice countermeasure against board sweepers. However, the other two modes aren't that exciting to me: this deck already has a Sliver for double strike, and once you amass your Sliver army the 4 points will seldom make the ultimate difference. I really want to play as many creatures as I can here and, so, while this is a reasonable sideboard card, I'd rather cut it for some more creatures. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Door+of+Destinies)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies)The Door can be quite powerful if put into the right tribal deck. Suddenly, your creatures are growing to absurd heights. However, oddly enough, Door isn't quite as potent with Slivers as with some other tribes.

 Each Sliver you cast *already* adds something to every creature you control due to the inherent nature of Slivers. How often is going to be casting this noncreature and then slowly building up counters going to be better than just playing another Sliver in the first place? While there are certainly situations where Door can be good, I'd rather just play more Slivers in its place. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mizzium+Mortars)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars) While I have been cutting a lot of the noncreatures out, [Mizzium Mortars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars) is one of the ones I'm happy to keep around. I want a little bit of removal to keep my opponent's creatures under control if I need to. Moreover, this deck can hit the overload pretty easily as long as you draw [Manaweft Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaweft+Sliver)! An overloaded Mortars will break most board stalls wide open, and the combination of cheap flexibility partnered with realistic capacity to overload make Mortars an attractive spell to keep around. 

I still only want it as a three-of so I don't draw too many instead of Slivers, but it is definitely the removal spell this deck wants.

Adding Slivers
With a lot of these noncreatures out of the way, that paves the way to add in some more Slivers. Which ones, might you ask? Well, let me go down the list of the three Slivers I'd like to add.

 One-drop Slivers can be particularly powerful. First of all, they give you a turn-one play. But second of all, with all of the enhancements a Sliver deck can produce, they quickly begin to outperform their pay grade. A one-drop curved into a Manaweft or [Predatory Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predatory+Sliver) is your ideal draw in many situations. 

 I'd like to add in four copies of [Striking Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Striking+Sliver). While its ability doesn't stack well (and also is made irrelevant when you land a [Bonescythe Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonescythe+Sliver)), it gives the deck a turn-one play and adds first strike to your team—a very strong ability for Slivers.
