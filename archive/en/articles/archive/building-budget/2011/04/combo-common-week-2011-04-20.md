Welcome to Common Week here on **MagicTheGathering.com**. Common Week seems like a good time to check in on the current Pauper format. Pauper is a powerful format, available on **Magic Online**, that allows you to play with cards from any set ever printed. There's a catch, though: you may only use commons when building your deck.

Pauper is constantly changing. The card pool is so vast that new and exciting decks are discovered on a regular basis. Today, I'm going to talk about the current boogieman of Pauper, [Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure) Combo!

Here's how it works:

You play [Nightscape Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar)s, [Sunscape Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Familiar)s, and card drawing spells until you're ready to go off. (This usually happens on the fourth turn.) You use cards like [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries), [Frantic Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search), and [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap) to create a lot of mana (via Familiars and *Ravnica* bouncelands letting you get ahead on mana with your "free" spells) and increase storm count. You cast a bunch of card draw and find a copy of [Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure). You bounce every permanent your opponent has on the battlefield back to his or her hand. You still have a few creatures that can casually attack for the win. The deck refills its hand while it combos too, so it's not unreasonable to combo off multiple times in a single game.

Let's talk about the cards that make this deck tick.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab139_theCardsHeader.jpg)  
Pauper is the only format wherein you can play a full four copies of [Frantic Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search). Legacy would be broken beyond repair if [Frantic Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search) was legal. The card is so powerful that it has been restricted in Vintage. [Frantic Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search) creates extra mana when used with *Ravnica* bounce lands, [Nightscape Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar), or [Sunscape Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Familiar). This may be the most abusable card in Pauper, and I'm happy to have four copies.

The deck uses [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries) and [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap) as other untap effects to generate mana alongside the bouncelands and familiars. [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries) is often a win condition. [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap) can be used to make other powerful plays. For example, [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)ping an evoked [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) and netting mana isn't uncommon. Normally, you want to use [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap) to target your [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries) to generate storm and mana.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab139_theCardsCross1.jpg)  
[Mnemonic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mnemonic+Wall) is a nice singleton that can often make otherwise underwhelming [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)s into huge plays. It's also a nice way to ensure that you're able to cast multiple [Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure)s at your leisure. Going infinite is important sometimes. Being able to bounce all your opponent's permanents, a [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries), and a [Mnemonic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mnemonic+Wall) is a way to ensure that you can combo off every single turn.

[Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) is incredible here. It functions very nicely as a card draw spell and it has the added bonus of working very well with [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap). It's also worth noting that [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) is probably the most common win condition when playing the deck.

[Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) is an absolute powerhouse in this type of strategy. I've always been a huge fan of the card selection and advantage granted by [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee). When you can successfully cast a [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) and still have enough mana for a [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap) or [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries), then it's usually going to result in a one-sided [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab139_theCardsCross2.jpg)  
[Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) is another classic card draw spell. Originally, I had four copies of [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) and only one copy of [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Personally, I prefer the card selection to cost of [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) over the increased number of card granted by [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). However, we are a deck with six bounce lands, and there are going to be a lot of games where we're forced to discard on the draw after playing a bounce land on the second turn. There's nothing we'd rather discard than [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis).

[Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) is the most efficiently costed *real* card-draw spell available in Pauper. Having enough card draw in this deck is very important to make sure you hit the cards you need to when you need to combo off in a tight spot.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab139_theCardsCross3.jpg)  
[Nightscape Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar) and [Sunscape Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Familiar) have powerful abilities that cheapen all your blue spells. A single Familiar on the battlefield is enough to power up all your [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries) and [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)s and turn them into ritual effects. Cheapening card draw and the namesake [Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure) is also a huge boon.

[Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure) is this deck's top end. It's not difficult to bounce all your opponent's permanents as early as turn three and then again on turns four, five, and six. Usually, you want to wait a turn or two in between each [Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure) to get some more value out of the storm.

In testing, I've found the only decks that pose a problem are aggressive red strategies and the mirror match. Occasionally, the [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) deck can outrace you, but their draws aren't as consistent and they run the risk of playing against a lot of hate after sideboarding from most decks.

The mirror match is a tough cookie to crack. I've seen lists that play [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop). It seems powerful, with a lot of applications, but it doesn't pack quite the punch we're looking for. Personally, I've found that [Boomerang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boomerang) is an excellent sideboard option for the mirror here. Most [Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure) players are *very* dependent on their bounce lands, and a timely [Boomerang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boomerang) is almost always enough to ensure that you're going to go off first.

![Boomerang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Boomerang)  
Red decks are a bit easier to tackle. A playset of [Vedalken Outlander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Outlander)s, a few [Galina's Knights](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knights), and a playset of [Steel of the Godhead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+of+the+Godhead) should be more than enough to put a nail into that coffin.

I'd like to share a few of the matches I've played with the deck.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab139_duress.jpg)I won the roll and kept [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds), [Nightscape Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar), [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee), [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries), and [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research). I played my [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and passed the turn. I cracked my [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) for a [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) on the end step. I drew an [Azorius Chancery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Chancery), played my [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), cast [Nightscape Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar), and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Ravenous Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Rats), I discarded my [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research), he passed the turn. I drew [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap), floated two mana, played my [Azorius Chancery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Chancery), returned my [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) to my hand, cast [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries), untapped my Chancery and [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), tapped them both, cast [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap) targeting the [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries), untapped both lands again, tapped both lands for mana, cast [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee), put [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) and [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap) on the top of my library, drew them, cast [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries), untapped both lands, tapped both lands again. Cast [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) and found a [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), a [Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure), and a [Mnemonic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mnemonic+Wall), cast [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap) on the [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries), untapped, cast Temporal [Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fissure), bouncing all three of my opponent's permanents, attacked for 1, and passed the turn.

My opponent played a [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and cast [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), but whiffed.

My opponent played a second land and recast [Ravenous Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Rats), and I discarded the [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). I drew a [Frantic Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search), attacked for 2 with [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), tapped my lands for mana, played another bounce land, cast [Frantic Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search), drew [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), discarded the land I returned to my hand and the [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), untapped and tapped both bounce lands and another land, used [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries) to generate a little more. I cast [Mnemonic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mnemonic+Wall), returned my [Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure) back to my hand, cast [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) for its flashback cost, and cast [Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure), which bounced all my opponent's permanents, my [Mnemonic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mnemonic+Wall), and my [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries). Now I had all the tools I needed to bounce all my opponent's permanents every turn, and that drew the concession.

**Sideboarding:** None

The mirror is entirely about who combos first. Winning the roll is very important, as most draws win on the third or fourth turn. Once one player combos, it's almost impossible for the other player to get back into the game.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab139_nightscape.jpg)I lost the roll and kept 2 [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse), [Sunscape Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Familiar), [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee), [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries), and [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter).

I had eight mana in my pool, and I cast [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) and went to five mana in my pool. I left a [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) and a [Frantic Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Research) on top.

**Sideboarding:** -2 Deep Analysis, -1 Snap, -1 Temporal [Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fissure), +3 [Boomerang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boomerang), +1 [Mnemonic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mnemonic+Wall).

If you're looking to do well in Pauper tournaments, then this is the deck for you. Pauper is one of the few formats where you can play a true combo deck that feels and acts like an old-school combo deck. If you're a Johnny, like me, then you should be sure to put this list together and play some games on **Magic Online**.

If you don't play online, you can start your own Pauper league. A number of my readers have started Pauper leagues at their schools or just amongst friends. Shoot me an email about your own Pauper league and tell me about some of the exciting decks.

Happy brewing!
