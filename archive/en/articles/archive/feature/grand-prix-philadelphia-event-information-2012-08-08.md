The fifth-largest city in the United States, the city's central location in the original 13 colonies meant that it was a focal point for America's revolutionaries. The Declaration of Independence was signed here in 1776 and many national historic sites are popular tourist attractions. Home to the Liberty Bell and the cheesesteak, Philadelphia offers a wide range of activities for visitors.

The main tournament at Grand Prix Philadelphia is open to **Magic**  players of all ages.

Players must have a signed publicity release form to be included in Wizards of the Coast's official online event coverage.

Minors must have a parent or guardian’s signature on this form. Publicity releases will be collected during registration.

**Tournament Format**
  


* [Day 1: Sealed Deck](/en/node/704561)  (6 packs of *Return to Ravnica*)
* [Day 2 and Top 8: Booster Draft](/en/node/704561) (3 packs of *Return to Ravnica*)
* Deck lists are required.
* If product is not stamped or preregistered, deck registration and deck swap will be performed for the Swiss Sealed Deck.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
