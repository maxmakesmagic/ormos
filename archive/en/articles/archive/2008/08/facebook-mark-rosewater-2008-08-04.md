I'd noticed that I hadn't been spontaneous in quite some time, so I thought I'd use the party as an opportunity to be spontaneous. That's why I was interested in pursuing White.

There isn't a color that cares more. Everything I do is driven by what I care about. I'm not some emotionless robot like Blue or stuck in mindless loops like White. I have passion. I have excitement. I scream. I yell. I cry. If anything, I probably care too much.

White, don't waste your breath. You're not going to be able to reason with Red. Red's incapable of reason.

At the cost of what? Like last night. I'm glad you wanted to listen to the music several decibels below the level of a sonic boom. But what about the rest of us?

I have to remember the name of every color I ever have a fling with? I don't have that kind of memory. I'm lucky if I know the name while it's happening.
