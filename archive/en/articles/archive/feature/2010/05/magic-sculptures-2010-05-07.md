People who were planning on going to [Gravesend Magic](http://www.gravesendmagic.co.uk/)'s "**Magic** in May" convention were treated to this mysterious announcement:

In an effort to bring you something new...  
 ...introducing probably the WORLD’S FIRST EVER... ### Magic Sculptor Challenge

 IF YOU BUILD THE MOST CREATIVE AND ARTISTIC PIECE OF SCULPTURE, YOU COULD WIN A FABULOUS PRIZE!Glen White's plan was to use up some of the extra cards that tend to accumulate at **Magic** events, and maybe create the World's Biggest **Magic** Card Menger Sponge. But we're more excited by the idea of **Magic** Card Sculptures!

First up, Daffydd Thurlow spent three and a half hours creating this sword.

For his work, Daffydd won an Intro Pack.

In second place, Rik Powell created this handsome AT-AT!

Note the snowspeeder zooming around the legs. Now that's attention to detail!

Rik's work earned him a copy of *Phyrexia vs. the Coalition*.

The winner was Nick Taylor, who created this terrific castle.

The key here is the attention to detail. The moat? Filled with *blue* cards. And there's even a knight defending the castle against marauding goblin hordes!

Nick won an uncut **Magic** sheet, which seems like a pretty good prize, doesn't it?

Congratulations to the three sculptors, and to Glen White of [Gravesend Magic](http://www.gravesendmagic.co.uk/) for coming up with a cool contest!
