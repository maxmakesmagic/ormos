One of the thrills of new *Commander* products is getting updated art on some often unexpected cards. For example, virtually no one was expecting the *Mirage* Diamonds to reappear, let alone with new art, but lo and behold, [Lindsey Look](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Lindsey+Look%22%5D) [knocked them out of the park](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/wizards-best-friend-2014-10-29).



There's also a cycle of Medallions by [Daniel Ljunggren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Daniel+Ljunggren%22%5D), pushing the number of new art pieces up to ten just in those two artifact cycles.


In fact, there are a few too many to show all of the new art in this one Arcana, but I wanted to highlight some notable pieces.


Sacred Mesa
===========


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sacred%20Mesa)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred%20Mesa)
[Sacred Mesa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Mesa) was once a tournament powerhouse, and even part of an early [Earthcraft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthcraft) combo with a Plains and [Wild Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Growth). It was reprinted once in [Time Spiral](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Spiral), but has never had new art. Until now. [Robbie Trevino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Robbie+Trevino%22%5D)'s update paints a gorgeous landscape that makes us believe it's home to pegasi.

Sylvan Safekeeper
=================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sylvan%20Safekeeper)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan%20Safekeeper)
Originally designed by Olle Råde as a prize for winning the old *Magic* Invitational, this is actually [Sylvan Safekeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Safekeeper)'s first reprinting ever. Along with gaining new wording (shroud and the Human Wizard type), [Magali Villeneuve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Magali+Villeneuve%22%5D) also updates the look of the Safekeeper.

Desert Twister
==============


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Desert%20Twister)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desert%20Twister)
Let's stay in green for a moment to revisit an old, old favorite. [Desert Twister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desert+Twister) has actually been reprinted a number of times. Originally from *Arabian Nights*, one of the few green cards ever able to destroy a nonflying creature then jumped into the core set with *Revised* and popped up occasionally over the years, yet it only received new art once, in *Mercadian Masques*. Now, [Noah Bradley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Noah+Bradley%22%5D) has provided a third take on the iconic card, one that certainly matches the flavor text: *Massive, mindless, and imbued with one terrible purpose.*

Exclude
=======


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Exclude)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude)
Finally, at least for today, we jump over to an old *Invasion* favorite that has never seen new art. There's so much value here, how could we not show it off? Oh, and [Greg Staples](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Greg+Staples%22%5D)'s new take is pretty spiffy too.
