It was another battle in the war for website dominance here in the semifinals of Pro Tour Philadelphia. On one side, Josh Utter-Leyton, flying the banner of Team ChannelFireball, playing their metagame-audible midrange Zoo deck. On the other, decked out in the grey and white of his patrons at StarCityGames, sat Sam Black. Black is a PT fixture, and this weekend he finally got to sit under the Sunday Lights. He's playing what many are calling the definitive version of the [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal) poison deck.



### Game One



It was an inauspicious start for Utter-Leyton, who mulliganed down to five. Uttered-Leyton led with [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa), and on his turn Black [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed and kept both. Another [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa) for Utter-Leyton, but still no play. Black fetched up a second [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and cast [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent). Utter-Leyton drew and passed it back.

*Americans Sam Black and Josh Utter-Leyton both have strong decks and the skills to pilot them, but only one can move on to the finals.*

Black considered for a moment, then played [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), getting rid of both. He drew [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) and cast it for 2 life. Utter-Leyton fanned out a hand of two [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Bant Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm), and two [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant). Black played [Watery Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave) untapped to go to 15, then hit for one poison and played a second [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent).


Utter-Leyton was in no hurry to crack his Mesas. He drew a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and played it, then let the two Agents bring him to three poison. At end of turn he searched up [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground) and [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) and hit one of the Agents with [Bant Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm). Black responded with [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths). He kept [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal), and let the Charm resolve.


Utter-Leyton untapped and sat back on his mana. The writing was on the wall when Black swung in and pitched [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) to [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal) with full knowledge of the Bolts in Utter-Leyton's hand. [Muddle the Mixture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muddle+the+Mixture) took care of the first and [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) the second, giving Black the first game of the match.


Black 1, Utter-Leyton 0



### Game Two



Utter-Leyton started at 17, fetching out [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground) for [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch). Black played [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and passed. Utter-Leyton took another 2 to get his [Sacred Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry) into play untapped, but made no move. Black checked out the situation with [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe): [Bant Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm), a second Hierarch, [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), and two lands. He played out a [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), which was immediately destroyed by the [Bant Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm).


Utter-Leyton untapped, played a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), and showed that he had drawn [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith), casting it for two and bringing [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) onto the battlefield. He added a second Hierarch and passed. Black drew and passed right back to him.


An exalted [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) hit for 4 and was joined by [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), already a 5/6. At end of turn, Black cast [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths), taking [Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback). Utter-Leyton played out his last card: A freshly drawn [Aven Mindcensor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor). Now Black had to fight through both [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) and the Bird Wizard.


Black untapped and drew, then considered his options. He played a third land and continued to think. With a half-shrug he passed the turn. Utter-Leyton's creatures hit for 7, leaving Black at 7. He Peered Through Depths again, this time finding [Slaughter Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact).




![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptphi11/sf2_black.jpg)

*A still from the opening credits of Sam Black's little-known sitcom. Or not.*

He untapped, [Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter)ed the Mindcensor, pitched [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) to [Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback), and went for the Shoal kill. Utter-Leyton picked up his hand, and for a moment the crowd held its breath... but then he scooped up the rest of his cards, and they let out a huge cheer.


Black 2, Utter-Leyton 0


While Utter-Leyton stepped away from the table for a moment, Black let out a sigh of relief. "This match-up is such a grind."


One of the crew stopped by, thinking that the match had ended, and Black responded, "Oh no, one more game," before correcting himself with a laugh. "Okay, technically one to three more games."



### Game Three



Utter-Leyton returned and they shuffled up for


### Game Three


. Utter-Leyton opened with [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) and, after Black played [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), played a [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest) and held back.



Black drew his card and weighed his options. He chose [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) off a second Nexus. At end of turn, Utter-Leyton used [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) to send it packing (with an assist from [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest)). Now it was his turn to decipher the situation. He fetched a third land and played [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage). Black pitched [Disrupting Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupting+Shoal) to [Disrupting Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupting+Shoal) to counter it. He untapped, played [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn), and passed.


Utter-Leyton had a second Pridemage at the ready, and this one hit the battlefield without incident. Black Peered through Depths at end of turn and added [Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback) to his hand. He played a fourth land and passed. Utter-Leyton swung for 3 and played [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl). Black Peered again, taking [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). He fetched [Watery Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave), killed the Pridemage with [Slaughter Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact), then paid on upkeep. He spent his last mana on [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), getting rid of both cards.


Utter-Leyton hit for 3 with his Nacatl, leaving Black at 12. Black made no play on his turn. Utter-Leyton flashed in [Aven Mindcensor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor), and it resolved. He played [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) and hit again with his Nacatl. Black was down to 8. Still he made no play. Utter-Leyton hit him to 4.

*An implacable Utter-Leyton claws his way back into this match.*

At end of turn, Black decided to make his move. [Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth), targeting [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer). Utter-Leyton shot him for 2 and let it resolve. Next, [Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback) targeting [Aven Mindcensor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor). Utter-Leyton responded with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), and they were on to


### Game Four


with Utter-Leyton now only one game behind.



Black 2, Utter-Leyton 1


"I'll draw."


Utter-Leyton thought he must've misheard. "You'll draw?"


Black nodded.



### Game Four



Utter-Leyton kept his opener, but Black went down to six. Utter-Leyton led out with a fetched [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground) for [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl). Black played [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and passed. [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa) got [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain), and Utter-Leyton hit for 3 before playing [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg).


Black untapped. He paid two life for [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) and saw a hand of [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze), [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) and [Horizon Canopy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Canopy). He drew for the [Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Probe), and passed the turn without playing a second land. Utter-Leyton dropped him to 10 and sat back. Black drew a second [Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Probe) and went to 8 to cast it. He played [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) and passed. Utter-Leyton hit for another 5. Fetching an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) dropped him to 2. He cast [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) and took [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal). He drew for his turn, then scooped up his cards.


Black 2, Utter-Leyton 2


"I guess I can't be too unhappy about missing my two-outer there on my last turn," said Black with a laugh.



### Game Five



Black put Utter-Leyton on the play again for the deciding game, and he led out with [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground)s, [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl). Black played [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed, choosing to keep the cards. Utter-Leyton fetched [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain) and tapped two for [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage). Black countered with [Disrupting Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupting+Shoal), pitching [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent). Utter-Leyton hit him to 17 and passed.


Black played [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and passed back. Utter-Leyton summoned a [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) and hit for 4, holding up two mana. Black Peered Through Depths and chose another [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths). He untapped, played an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and passed. Utter-Leyton cashed in his [Horizon Canopy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Canopy) for a card. The [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) hit for another 4, and Utter-Leyton played another angry Cat after combat. [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) got Black a [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), which he untapped and cast. He kept one of the cards. After a think, he passed the turn.




![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptphi11/sf2_black2.jpg)

*Sam Black's thinky face.*

Utter-Leyton fetched [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) at end of turn, then untapped, played a [Sacred Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry) untapped and hit for seven. Black was down to just 2 life. He tapped out for [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths). Utter-Leyton went for [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) and Black threw down [Disrupting Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupting+Shoal), pitching [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent). He Peered into [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), and the crowd started murmuring. He untapped and [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed, and the crowd grew louder as he plucked each card. He sent them all back in a shuffle, left with just one more draw. The crowd was calling him to rip the win. He laid his hand out on the table to show Utter-Leyton what was up: He needed to draw a [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal).


Utter-Leyton laughed. "Slam it."


With a flourish, Black threw down the top card of his library without looking, to reveal... [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus).


Black extended his hand in congratulations.


Josh Utter-Leyton defeats Sam Black 3-2 and advances to the finals!
