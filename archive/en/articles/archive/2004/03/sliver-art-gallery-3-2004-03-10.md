M[onday](/en/articles/archive/sliver-art-gallery-2004-03-08) we looked at *Stronghold's* multicolored Slivers, and [yesterday](/en/articles/archive/sliver-art-gallery-2-2004-03-09) we focused on *Tempest's* 2/2 uncommon Slivers. Today we were going to finish out *Tempest* with a look at the art of the 1/1 commons; unfortunately, not all the commons' art is currently in the art database (no worries; the couple missing ones are around here somewhere, they're just temporarily misplaced).


So in place of [Muscle Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Muscle%2BSliver), [Clot Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Clot%2BSliver) and [Metallic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Metallic%2BSliver) Slivers' art, instead please enjoy the bonus art of [Sliver Overlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Overlord) and of the *Legions* Sliver token, both by the illustrious Tony Szczudlo.
