When R&D was putting together the [five decks](/en/articles/archive/commander-decks-2011-04-06) that make up [***Magic: The Gathering** Commander*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/commander/productinfo), they had a lot of things to keep in mind. A lot of rules, if you will, for making good Commander decks. And one of the most common deckbuilding rules goes like this:


[Sol Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring) goes in every Commander deck.


Some people modify that rule to allow for people who have more decks than [Sol Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring)s. But we're Wizards of the Coast. We have as many [Sol Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring)s as we want to have. So with that in mind...


A card that is in all five ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* decks!

Â 
That's right. Whichever Commander deck you buy, there will be a [Sol Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring) in it.


They come out on June 17, and the MSRP is $29.99. Our previews of the new cards start on Monday, June 6. We'll see you there!
