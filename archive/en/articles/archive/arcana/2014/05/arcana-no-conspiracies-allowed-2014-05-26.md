When we announced *Conspiracy*, amid the puzzles and confusion, we also included a note that the entire set, except thirteen cards, would be legal in Vintage and Legacy. This caused quite a discussion. What were we doing? Why are these thirteen cards not legal in the formats?


Hopefully, now that you've seen some of the cards, you understand just how warping they would be, and it will come as no surprise that we are formally announcing the banning of all thirteen cards of the conspiracy type from the Vintage and Legacy formats. And, as a result of that, they are also banned in Commander (since all cards banned in Vintage are also banned in Commander). This list includes four you haven't yet seen!




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Advantageous Proclamation | Brago's Favor |
| Secrets of Paradise | Sentinel Dispatch |


So, to be explicitly clear and avoid any confusion, the thirteen cards being added to the Vintage and Legacy banned lists are:


* Advantageous Proclamation
* Backup Plan
* Brago's Favor
* Double Stroke
* Immediate Action
* Iterative Analysis
* Muzzio's Preparations
* Power Play
* Secret Summoning
* Secrets of Paradise
* Sentinel Dispatch
* Unexpected Potential
* Worldknit

But let's enter a parallel universe and consider what might happen if conspiracies were legal in Vintage. How degenerate would they be? Well...


Why don't you tell us? Send me your best ideas, using the link in the footer of the article, of how you could abuse conspiracies in Vintage, and I'll share my favorite ideas in a future Arcana!
