Pro Players Club Guidelines and Procedures
==========================================


June 30, 2005
 








Pro Players Club Guidelines and Procedures
*Effective March 10, 2014*

 The following Pro Tour Players Club Guidelines and Procedures document identifies all applicable requirements and limitations for participation in the **Magic: The Gathering**Â® Pro Tour Players Club (the "Pro Players Club", or "Club"). By signing a Consent and Waiver Agreement, and receiving the Club benefits, you agree to adhere to all conditions and requirements for entry and participation in the Club. Any questions regarding Club membership or requirements may be submitted to Wizards at [www.wizards.com/customerservice](http://wizards.custhelp.com/). Click on the "Email Us" tab, sign in, then select "WPN Players", then "PT Players Club". 

The information contained below applies to the 2013-2014 Pro Tour Players Club only. 

Membership
**Joining the Pro Players Club**  


The 2013-2014 Professional Points season begins May 20, 2013 and ends August 3, 2014, and all tournaments included in that time period make up the season.

 Professional Points are officially awarded on the final day of applicable tournaments after the final standings have been determined by Wizards. Only players who actually compete in the applicable tournaments will receive Professional Points for those tournaments. Tournaments, information about Professional Points Seasons, and the number of Professional Points awarded to players from those tournaments can be found in the [**Magic: The Gathering** Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://archive.wizards.com/wpn/Document.aspx?x=Magic_The_Gathering_Premier_Event_Invitation_Policy). 

**Eligibility**  


**Attaining Levels of Membership**  


The minimum number of Professional Points required in the 2013-2014 Professional Points Season for (1) immediate promotion to Pro Club levels and applicable benefits in the 2013-2014 Pro Club and (2) levels and benefits in the 2014-2015 Pro Tour Players Club are:

* Silver level: 20 Professional Points
* Gold Level: 35 Professional Points
* Platinum level: 45 Professional Points
The winner of each Pro Tour and World Championship is immediately advanced to Platinum level for the remainder of the current season and the entirety of the following season (as if that player had reached the minimum number of Professional Points at that Pro Tour or World Championship to be promoted to Platinum level).
