2001 GRAND PRIX KOBE COVERAGE
=============================

|  | 2001 Grand Prix Kobe Coverage |

After waiting in the wings for so long, after many Pro Tours and Grand Prix that saw him come so close without grabbing the brass ring, and after demonstrating his skills as a team competitor, Itaru Ishida has finally taken his first individual title. He did it at no less than the largest Grand Prix in Magic history: 1,350 competitors. The final match lasted no more than twenty minutes, as Ishida's near-permanentless blue-white-red deck dissected Shuhei Nakamura's red-green beatdown. He took the final game in style, on the back of a doubly-kicked Rakavolver. Congratulations to Itaru Ishida, Grand Prix - Kobe Champion!
