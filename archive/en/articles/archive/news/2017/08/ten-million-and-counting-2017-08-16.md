On August 13, in the town of Barrie, Ontario, players gathered to play in the ten-millionth sanctioned *Magic* event ever held.


Let that sink in for a moment.


Ten. Million. That includes everything from small tournaments at stores all the way up to Pro Tours. Most events are store-level events, so it was appropriate that such a milestone was reached at a store like many others—[OMG Games and Collectibles](http://www.omggames.ca/).


The event was Standard Showdown and featured four rounds with 33 players. It was also held as a fundraiser for Children's Aid Society of Simcoe County, raising $1,000 (CAN) for the charity. I'm sure someone went undefeated—but that hardly seems the point.


The point was a celebration of *Magic*, a celebration of store-level events, and a celebration of what makes *Magic* a great game to gather around. Here's to ten million more.


Check out the photos below from the event, which was attended by Gavin Verhey and Nelson Brown from Wizards of the Coast.
