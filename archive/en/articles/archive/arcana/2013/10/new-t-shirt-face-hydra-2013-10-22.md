How did you do at Game Day last weekend? Did you get to battle the Hydra on the third stage of the Hero's Path?

A lot of you have said how much you enjoyed facing the hydra, it is a new experience and something we were experimenting with, so to see your responses is awesome.

We're also experimenting with a new sort of shirt. We made this limited edition so if you want it you're going to need to order it soon!
