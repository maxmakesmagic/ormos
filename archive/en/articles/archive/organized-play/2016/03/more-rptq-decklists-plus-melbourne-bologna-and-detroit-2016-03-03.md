Meanwhile, as we look ahead to this weekend...


Grand Prix Melbourne, Bologna, and Detroit
==========================================


Do you like Grand Prix? Great. What about double Grand Prix weekend? Okay, fine.


How about three?


The triple Grand Prix is what you're getting this weekend, as Modern main event GPs take place in the Oceanic, European, and North American regions, giving players from all over the world the chance to earn Pro Points, Pro Tour invitations, and their share of the combined $150,000 that will be awarded in prize money by the end of Sunday.


The three Grand Prix, all featuring Modern Constructed, are a check-in one month after Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*, and there is one central question on everyone's minds: Can the Eldrazi be beaten?


The one-two punch of [Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin) and [Eldrazi Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple) made its power known on the global stage at the Pro Tour, as six Eldrazi decks made their way into the Top 8. The Eldrazi decks have shown no signs of slowing down, and have only continued to evolve. However, some players have looked to cards such as [Worship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship), [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge), and [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) to hold back the alien force. Will the Eldrazi make their presence unforgettable this weekend, or will they be dethroned by some new strategy? Time will tell.

First to begin will be Grand Prix Melbourne, as Asia and Oceania's best players show what they've got in the two-day Modern main event. Ray "Blisterguy" Walkinshaw will be reporting on the latest happenings from Australia all weekend, so check out the [GP Melbourne coverage page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmel16) for the latest to emerge!


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/20160303_Bologna.png)


Up next is Grand Prix Bologna, an event that is sure to delight many since the main event is already sold out of its 2,000 seats! Many of Europe's most passionate Modern players will be traveling to Italy to prove what they've got to bring to the table for their share of the $50,000 prize pool. Who will win?


European coverage team members Tobi Henke and Frank Karsten will be reporting on their findings all weekend, so save the link to the [GP Bologna coverage page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbol16) and check back regularly starting Saturday for articles, decklists, and more!

And finally, Grand Prix Detroit will round out the triple GP weekend as the last event to finish on Sunday, where North America's Modern players will battle for their shot at the trophy.

February 2016 Player of the Month: Jiachen Tao
==============================================


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/OP20160303_PTOGW.jpg)


While No. 1–ranked player Owen Turtenwald made a strong case for himself at Grand Prix Houston—the sole GP of February—by winning his fourth Grand Prix title, ultimately it was not enough to dethrone a Pro Tour Champion from owning the month. Jiachen Tao and Team East West Bowl made quite an impression at [Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptogw) by being one step ahead of ChannelFireball and Face to Face Games on the new Eldrazi technology to emerge from the weekend.


Tao's victory with the deck is more than enough to make him February's Player of the Month.
