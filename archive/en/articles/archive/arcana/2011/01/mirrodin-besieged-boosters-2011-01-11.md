Let's say you're excited about *Mirrodin Besieged*. You are, right? It's coming out pretty soon. The prereleases are the weekend of January 29, and previews start on Monday, January 17. We're putting a lot of effort into this, so you could at least pretend to be excited.

Okay! So you're excited now! But you haven't seen the booster packs yet. How are you supposed to rush out as soon as you can and start ripping open *Mirrodin Besieged* boosters if you don't even know what they look like? Without the proper information, who knows what you could end up ripping open? We can't have that!

Without further ado:
