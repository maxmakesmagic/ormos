Two weeks ago, we [announced a contest](/en/articles/archive/underworld-awakening-contest-2012-01-02) that related to *[Underworld Awakening](http://www.entertheunderworld.com/)*, which will hit movie theatres tomorrow, January 20, 2012. To refresh your memory of the movie, here's the trailer again.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/876_tablet.jpg)The Grand Prize was a Sony Tablet S (with cradle, screen protector, AC adaptor, and an entertainment bundle), a signed poster from *Underworld Awakening*, 72 *Innistrad* boosters, and a free screening of *Underworld Awakening* for the winner and up to a *hundred* guests!

The second-place winners will each receive six *Innistrad* boosters and a pack of *Underworld Awakening* swag including a T-shirt, a poster, a soundtrack CD, and a ticket to see the movie.

We received so many great entries talking about a lot of great WPN stores it was hard to choose the winners. As a thank you to everyone that send in their essay we will be sending them their own copy of the [2011 Holiday card "Yule Ooze"](/en/articles/archive/2011-holiday-card-2011-11-29).

The winner is Alex Bastecki, who wrote the following essay about [The Adventurer's Guild](http://www.theadventurersguild.com/) in Harrisburg, PA.


> Why is my local store a great place to go?
> 
> 
> **T**his one is easy.  
> **H**aving a play space to play Magic, D&D and board games  
> **E**ven when they aren't scheduled.
> 
> 
> **A** place where attendance has almost  
> **D**oubled for drafts and FNMs since the new owner took over in the fall, where even he will battle  
> **V**intage with his customers.  
> **E**veryone in the store gets along,  
> **N**urturing a community setting where all are welcome to play.  
> **T**he midnight Magic prereleases allow players their first chance to howl at the moon while playing  
> **U**ntil the sun comes up the next day.  
> **R**olling critical hits make the Dungeon Masters cringe during our D&D Encounters, who play beside  
> **E**very level of Magic player, from the casual Commander player to competitive level grinders.  
> **R**arely will you find a time where something is not going on, whether it be  
> **S**linging spells from a Pauper cube or rolling critical hits against a Dungeon Master.
> 
> 
> **G**uiding the transformation of the store is Jason,  
> **U**nder whom, with his crew of Tournament Organizers, Dungeon Masters, and Magic Judges, are  
> **I**mproving not only the rich wealth of programs of the WPN system, but the  
> **L**ook and feel of the store, giving players a place they can proud to be  
> **D**oing the things they love.
>
