Three months ago, we announced the [Fantasy Pro Tour for Pro Tour *Dark Ascension*](/en/articles/archive/fantasy-pro-tour-2012-02-08). The format was Standard, and the winning set of cards was this:



> [Garruk, Primal Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Primal+Hunter)  
> [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)  
> [Geist of Saint Traft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft)  
> [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)  
> [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)  
> [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)  
> [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring)  
> [Seachrome Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast)
> 
> 
> 

Now it's time for the Fantasy Pro Tour to move into the unknown world of *Innistrad/Avacyn Restored* Block Constructed for Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored*. As before, here are the steps:


**STEP ONE**: Go to the [Fantasy Pro Tour](http://apps.facebook.com/magicfantasyprotour/) on Facebook.


**STEP TWO**: Select a "team" of cards, made up of a Planeswalker, a large creature, a medium creature, a small creature, an instant, a sorcery, an enchantment, an artifact, and a nonbasic land. Add a Pro Tour player as your tiebreaker. You have until Friday, May 11 at 3:00 AM EDT to lock your rosters.


**STEP THREE**: Once the Pro Tour starts on Friday, you'll be able to compare your team to your friends' teams. [Follow the coverage](/en/events/coverage/angels-carry-hayne-miraculous-victory) to see what cards are showing up!


**STEP FOUR**: You'll get between 2 and 5 points for every time a card you picked appears in the top-performing Block Constructed decks at the Pro Tour. A "top-performing" deck is one that goes at least 6-4 across the ten Swiss constructed rounds.


**STEP FIVE**: You won! Great work! Say, you really know your stuff!


That about covers it. The [Fantasy Pro Tour](http://apps.facebook.com/magicfantasyprotour/) awaits!
