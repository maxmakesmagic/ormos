We here at Wizards of the Coast strive to provide a fun and stable environment for players to enjoy **Magic Online** game play. Unfortunately, technical issues can occasionally arise that may disrupt the game service. While we cannot prevent all such possible issues, the **Magic Online** Game Support Team strives to help players who experience technical problems in **Magic Online** (it’s what we’re here for!) as quickly and efficiently as possible.

If you experience a technical issue while you're playing in a **Magic Online** event (e.g., disruption in game play and/or an event), you may request reimbursement through Game Support by [letting them know](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/668/) what happened. When we receive a completed request for reimbursement, a Game Support team member will review your request, verify the details, and take the appropriate action as determined by Wizards in its sole discretion. This process also delivers important feedback to our development team about possible glitches in our game system that helps us improve **Magic Online**.

In order to refine the review and reimbursement process and make it faster, beginning after our scheduled maintenance on March 14, 2012, Wizards will reimburse eligible players using the same format as the entry option used to enter the disrupted event (e.g., tickets, a combination of boosters and tickets, etc., less any prizes won) instead of issuing a coupon code that can later be redeemed for those items. This streamlined process allows players to get back into events faster than before: no more checking emails for your coupon code, no worries about your coupon code expiring, and no more coupon code entries in the **Magic Online** Store. As soon as your request is reviewed and approved, and the product is delivered to your account, you can jump into the next available event!

We are very excited to make this change because it means you will be able to get back into the game faster than ever. Because not all **Magic Online** event issues may qualify you for reimbursement, however, please make sure you read the full [Reimbursement Policy](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/26/). Note: All coupon codes issued before March 14, 2012 will continue to be valid until their expiration date (which is 30 days after they were issued). Game Support cannot, however, apply the new Reimbursement Policy to those compensation codes received prior to March 14, 2012. They must be redeemed pursuant to the prior coupon code process.

Best of luck in your next event and have fun!

Sincerely,  
 The **Magic Online** Game Support Team
