The idea behind *Shards of Alara*'s "Panorama" lands is that they represent a bird's-eye-view of each plane. Or aven's-eye. Maybe dragon's-eye. You get the idea.


For example, here's the art description for [Grixis Panorama](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grixis+Panorama):



> 
> Color: Land associated with black, blue, and red mana  
> 
> Location: Grixis  
> 
> Action: Magic has done a zillion landscapes. This one is a little different. It represents the sky itself, high above Grixis. Show a "one-point perspective" of a Grixis skyscape, with the vanishing point low in the frame. A little bit of terrain can be seen toward the bottom of the frame: dark seas, jagged mountains, and the festering "Dregscape." Grixis's sky is riddled with pink heat-lightning and black, roiling clouds, so a sense of that is important as well.  
> 
> Focus: the scene  
> 
> Mood: Inside the darkest storm, looking down on the darkest land.
> 


So the concept is that the [Grixis Panorama](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grixis+Panorama) includes all of the lands of Grixis, but "zoomed out" so far that the sky itself dominates the picture. But when the card gets sacrificed to fetch a specific land, you're zooming back in to the [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), or [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) of your choice. Until then, though, what you see is mostly sky:

Now, here's the other four. Ideally, you should be able to immediately identify which shard each panorama is associated with!
