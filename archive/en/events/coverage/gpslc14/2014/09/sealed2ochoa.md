The exciting conclusion! So far, with Sealed Pool #2 we've seen (18) Alex Hayne make a Red-White deck and Christian Calcano make a Green-White deck. Rather than siding with one or the other, Super-pro David Ochoa went his own way, and comprehensively built a whole different animal.


Before we get to that, I want to talk a bit about the man, the myth, the unassuming David Ochoa. He's one of the most recognizable people on the circuit, one of the most welcoming, and one of the most meticulous. He's often described as "stoic" or even "taciturn" (for the GRE-exam inclined), but listening to Ochoa break down a format, or even just a Sealed pool, is an enlightening experience. He did it on Friday night to a crowd of people delivering a ChannelFireball Sealed lecture on the eve of the Grand Prix, and he did it for me here. He knows what he's doing, and he does it with confidence and style.


Each card pile is organized with care and precision. After discounting an entire color, instead of haphazardly pushing the cards to the side, they're stacked, and certain cards are angled differently if they have potential contextual uses. When deciding cuts, the cards under the knife are placed sideways in between the piles of definite cards and are each given their due consideration.
