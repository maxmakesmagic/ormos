The  cycle of [*Planar Chaos* charms](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=charm&Field_Name=on&setfilter=Planar%20Chaos) represent fragments of pure colored energy—refracted through the slightly twisted lens of *Planar Chaos*. Take a look at John Avon’s art of each charm (presented here in classic “WUBRG” order) as you contemplate each spell’s abilities. Which abilities seem in-flavor to you? Which make sense in the light of *Planar Chaos’s* expanded definitions of the “color pie”? How do the illustrations evoke the flavor of each color?

 The design of [Dawn Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Charm) evokes the feel of an achievement medal. The charm encases raw white spell magic, and seems to hang in the air, radiating a holy glow.

[Piracy Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy+Charm) is sleek, burnished metal swirling with mists of blue energy. The blue material under it evokes the cloth of a formal wizard’s gown.

 Part of a bone necklace, [Midnight Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm) is held here by the withered hands of a necromancer or other black-aligned mage. Note that he's missing part of a thumb, no doubt a symptom of past deals with sinister forces. 
 


### [Fury Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+Charm)

[Fury Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+Charm) depicts dynamic red magic inside a heavy, worn-metal bauble, resting inside weather-beaten hands. It evokes the feel of a worldly shaman keeping his trusty wild magics close at hand.

 Gentle hands cradle [Evolution Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolution+Charm). Note the use of natural materials in this charm—feathers, leaves, and bone.
