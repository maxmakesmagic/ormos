The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Support.Wizards.com](http://support.wizards.com/).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

Go to [Locator.Wizards.com](http://locator.wizards.com/) to find an event or store near you.




---

Returning Theme: Guilds and Guildmarks
--------------------------------------


Following the *Guilds of Ravnica* set, the remaining five guilds take the stage as tensions rise across Ravnica: the Azorius Senate, the Orzhov Syndicate, the Cult of Rakdos, the Gruul Clans, and the Simic Combine.


Each guild has its own symbol that appears on cards associated with that guild. These guildmarks have no effect on gameplay or deck construction.




---

Azorius Ability Word: Addendum
------------------------------


The best Azorius politicians are flexible in their goals and tactics, and *addendum* is an ability word that allows savvy spellcasters to tailor the effects of some spells according to the situation at hand. You can cast spells with addendum on your opponent's turn at need, or wait until your main phase to cast them for an added bonus.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sphinx%27s+Insight)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Insight)
Sphinx's Insight  

2WU  

Instant  

Draw two cards.  
*Addendum* — If you cast this spell during your main phase, you gain 2 life.


Addendum is an ability word. Ability words appear in italics and have no rules meaning.


* Addendum abilities of instant spells apply while the spell is resolving, not immediately after casting it. If the spell is countered, you don't get the addendum bonus. For example, if you cast Sphinx's Insight during your main phase, you gain 2 life during its resolution, after you draw two cards.
* If a spell with an addendum ability is copied, the copy won't give you the addendum bonus. This is because the copy wasn't cast at all.



---

Orzhov Keyword Ability: Afterlife
---------------------------------


Death is not the end of a contract with the Orzhov Syndicate, and many Ravnicans find themselves bound in servitude to the Orzhov after their final moments. Creatures with *afterlife* leave Spirits behind when they die.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Imperious+Oligarch)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Oligarch)
Imperious Oligarch  

WB  

Creature — Human Cleric  

2/1  

Vigilance  

Afterlife 1 *(When this creature dies, create a 1/1 white and black Spirit creature token with flying.)*


The official rules for afterlife are as follows:


702.134. Afterlife


702.134a Afterlife is a triggered ability. "Afterlife N" means "When this permanent is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, create N 1/1 white and black Spirit creature tokens with flying."


702.134b If a permanent has multiple instances of afterlife, each one triggers separately.


* Because blockers are chosen all at once, you can't block with a creature with afterlife, wait for it to die, then block with the resulting Spirit tokens.



---

Rakdos Keyword Ability: Spectacle
---------------------------------


The Rakdos believe that there is no true revelry without someone getting hurt. If that someone is your opponent, *spectacle* will reward you with discounted costs or additional rewards for your spells.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Skewer+the+Critics)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skewer+the+Critics)
Skewer the Critics  

2R  

Sorcery  

Spectacle R *(You may cast this spell for its spectacle cost rather than its mana cost if an opponent lost life this turn.)*  

Skewer the Critics deals 3 damage to any target.


The official rules for spectacle are as follows:


702.136. Spectacle


702.136a Spectacle is a static ability that functions on the stack. "Spectacle [cost]" means "You may pay [cost] rather than pay this spell's mana cost if an opponent lost life this turn." Paying a spell's spectacle cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.


* Damage dealt to a player causes that player to lose that much life.
* Spectacle doesn't change when you can cast the card. For example, you can't cast a sorcery with spectacle during an opponent's turn unless another effect allows you to do so, even if that player has lost life this turn.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as a spectacle cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* A card's spectacle cost is the same no matter how much life your opponents lost or how many opponents lost life.
* In a multiplayer game, if an opponent loses life and later that turn leaves the game, you can cast a spell for its spectacle cost. (If a player leaves the game during their turn, that turn continues without an active player.)



---

Gruul Keyword Ability: Riot
---------------------------


Nomadic by nature, members of the Gruul Clans rely on strength and speed to successfully raid new stomping grounds. Creatures with the *riot* ability can enter the battlefield with either haste or a +1/+1 counter, giving you the choice between attacking your opponent as quickly as possible or waiting a bit longer to hit even harder.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zhur-Taa+Goblin)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zhur-Taa+Goblin)
Zhur-Taa Goblin  

RG  

Creature — Goblin Berserker  

2/2  

Riot *(This creature enters the battlefield with your choice of a +1/+1 counter or haste.)*


The official rules for riot are as follows:


702.135. Riot


702.135a Riot is a static ability. "Riot" means "You may have this permanent enter the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on it. If you don't, it gains haste."


702.135b If a permanent has multiple instances of riot, each one works separately.


* Riot is a replacement effect. Players can't respond to your choice of +1/+1 counter or haste, and they can't take actions while the creature is on the battlefield without one or the other.
* If a creature entering the battlefield has riot but can't have a +1/+1 counter put onto it, it gains haste.
* If you choose for the creature to gain haste, it gains haste indefinitely. It won't lose it as the turn ends or as another player gains control of it.
* If a creature enters the battlefield with two instances of riot, you may choose to have it get two +1/+1 counters, one +1/+1 counter and haste, or two instances of haste. Multiple instances of haste on the same creature are redundant, but we're not going to tell the Gruul how to live their lives.



---

Simic Keyword Action: Adapt
---------------------------


Within every ecosystem, adaptability is the key to success—and the biomancers of the Simic Combine are happy to shape evolution according to their designs. The *adapt* ability is the latest innovation in Simic technology, imbuing creatures with a latent power and toughness boost that can be activated with an infusion of mana.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aeromunculus)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeromunculus)
Aeromunculus  

1GU  

Creature — Homunculus Mutant  

2/3  

Flying  

2GU: Adapt 1. *(If this creature has no +1/+1 counters on it, put a +1/+1 counter on it.)*


The official rules for adapt are as follows:


701.42. Adapt


701.42a "Adapt N" means "If this permanent has no +1/+1 counters on it, put N +1/+1 counters on it."


* You can always activate an ability that will cause a creature to adapt. As that ability resolves, if the creature has a +1/+1 counter on it for any reason, you simply won't put any +1/+1 counters on it.
* If a creature somehow loses all of its +1/+1 counters, it can adapt again and get more +1/+1 counters.



---

Returning Mechanic: Hybrid Mana
-------------------------------


Hybrid mana symbols represent a cost that can be paid with either of two colors. For example, w/u can be paid with either W or U. It's both a white and a blue mana symbol.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Senate+Griffin)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Senate+Griffin)
Senate Griffin  

2w/uw/u  

Creature — Griffin  

3/2  

Flying  

When Senate Griffin enters the battlefield, scry 1.


* As you cast a spell or activate an activated ability with hybrid mana symbols in its cost, you choose which color of mana you will spend for each hybrid mana symbol. You do this at the same time you would choose modes or choose a value for an X in a mana cost. For example, you choose whether you'll cast Senate Griffin by paying 2WW, 2WU, or 2UU.
* Each two-color hybrid symbol adds 1 to a card's converted mana cost. For example, the converted mana cost of Senate Griffin is 4.
* A card with hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost is each color that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. For example, Senate Griffin is white and blue, even if you cast it with only white mana.
* Similarly, a card's color identity (used in the Commander variant) always includes both of the colors that appear in a hybrid mana symbol on that card. Senate Griffin can't be included in a commander deck whose commander has a color identity of only white, even though Senate Griffin could be cast with only white mana.



---

Returning Mechanic: Split Cards
-------------------------------


Split cards return in the *Ravnica Allegiance* set, finishing out the cycle started with the *Guilds of Ravnica* split cards. One half of the split card has a hybrid mana cost, and the other has a mana cost that requires two colors of mana.


![Thrash // Threat](https://media.wizards.com/2018/rna/en_wNzmGOSPvX_side.png)


Thrash  

r/gr/g  

Instant  

Target creature you control deals damage equal to its power to target creature or planeswalker you don't control.  

//  

Threat  

2RG  

Sorcery  

Create a 4/4 red and green Beast creature token with trample.


* To cast a split card, you choose one half to cast. There's no way to cast both halves of the split cards featured in this set.
* All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack as only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting spells with converted mana cost 4 or greater, you can still cast Thrash.
* Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard a split card, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Thrash // Threat counts once, not twice.
* Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one of those names, but not both.
* While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Thrash // Threat is both an instant card and a sorcery card and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 5 or less from your hand, you can't cast Thrash or Threat.
* If you copy a spell that's half of a split card, the copy copies that same half. For example, if you copy Threat, the copy is also Threat, not Thrash.



---

Returning Cycle: *Ravnica* Dual Lands
-------------------------------------


There are five nonbasic lands in the *Ravnica Allegiance* set that each have two basic land types.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Godless+Shrine)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godless+Shrine)
Godless Shrine  

Land — Plains Swamp  
*(T: Add W or B.)*  

As Godless Shrine enters the battlefield, you may pay 2 life. If you don't, it enters the battlefield tapped.


* Unlike most dual lands, this land has two basic land types. It's not basic, so cards such as Open the Gates can't find it, but it does have the appropriate land types for effects such as that of Drowned Catacomb (from the *Ixalan* set).
* If an effect puts this land onto the battlefield tapped, you may pay 2 life, but it still enters tapped.



---

CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES
===================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=absorb)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb)
Absorb  

WUU  

Instant  

Counter target spell. You gain 3 life.


* A spell that can't be countered is a legal target for Absorb. The spell won't be countered when Absorb resolves, but you'll still gain 3 life.



---

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Act+of+Treason)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason)
Act of Treason  

2R  

Sorcery  

Gain control of target creature until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn.


* Act of Treason can target any creature, even one that's untapped or one you already control.
* Gaining control of a creature doesn't cause you to gain control of any Auras or Equipment attached to it.



---

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Amplifire)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amplifire)
Amplifire  

2RR  

Creature — Elemental  

1/1  

At the beginning of your upkeep, reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a creature card. Until your next turn, Amplifire's base power becomes twice that card's power and its base toughness becomes twice that card's toughness. Put the revealed cards on the bottom of your library in a random order.


* Amplifire will be a 1/1 creature from the time your untap step begins until the time its triggered ability resolves during your upkeep.
* Any effects that modify Amplifire's power and/or toughness without setting them to a specific number or value will apply after its base power and toughness are set, regardless of the order in which those effects were created. The same is true of counters that modify its power and toughness.
* If you reveal your entire library and don't reveal a creature card, Amplifire becomes a 0/0 creature and you put your library back in a random order.



---

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Angel+of+Grace)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Grace)
Angel of Grace  

3WW  

Creature — Angel  

5/4  

Flash  

Flying  

When Angel of Grace enters the battlefield, until end of turn, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.  

4WW, Exile Angel of Grace from your graveyard: Your life total becomes 10.


* Angel of Grace's triggered ability doesn't prevent damage. It only changes the result of damage dealt to you. For example, a creature with lifelink that deals damage to you will still cause its controller to gain life, even if that damage would reduce your life total to less than 1.
* Angel of Grace's triggered ability doesn't stop loss of life from effects that say that you lose life.
* If you have less than 1 life and somehow haven't lost the game, damage dealt to you reduces your life total further below 0 (as normal).
* For a player's life total to become 10, that player gains or loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if your life total is 2, Angel of Grace's last ability will cause you to gain 8 life; alternatively, if your life total is 20, it will cause you to lose 10 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, after resolving Angel of Grace's triggered ability, damage dealt to you and/or your teammate that would reduce your team's life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, the activated ability of Angel of Grace causes you to gain or lose life so that your team's life total becomes 10.
* In a Commander game, combat damage you're dealt by a commander is still tracked, even if it doesn't change your life total.



---

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Angelic+Exaltation)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Exaltation)
Angelic Exaltation  

3W  

Enchantment  

Whenever a creature you control attacks alone, it gets +X/+X until end of turn, where X is the number of creatures you control.


* A creature attacks alone if it's the only creature declared as an attacker during the declare attackers step (including creatures controlled by your teammates, if applicable). For example, Angelic Exaltation's ability won't trigger if you attack with multiple creatures and all but one of them are removed from combat.
* The value of X is determined only as Angelic Exaltation's ability begins to resolve. It won't change later in the turn if the number of creatures you control changes.



---

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arrester%27s+Admonition)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrester%27s+Admonition)
Arrester's Admonition  

2U  

Instant  

Return target creature to its owner's hand.  
*Addendum* — If you cast this spell during your main phase, draw a card.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Arrester's Admonition tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You don't draw a card if you cast it during your main phase.



---

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Awaken+the+Erstwhile)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awaken+the+Erstwhile)
Awaken the Erstwhile  

3BB  

Sorcery  

Each player discards all the cards in their hand, then creates that many 2/2 black Zombie creature tokens.


* The number of Zombie tokens each player creates is equal to the number of cards that player discarded, not the total number of cards discarded.



---

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bankrupt+in+Blood)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bankrupt+in+Blood)
Bankrupt in Blood  

1B  

Sorcery  

As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice two creatures.  

Draw three cards.


* You must sacrifice exactly two creatures to cast Bankrupt in Blood; you can't cast it without sacrificing two creatures, and you can't sacrifice additional creatures.
* Players can respond only after Bankrupt in Blood has been cast and all its costs have been paid. No one can try to destroy the creatures you sacrificed to prevent you from casting this spell.



---

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Basilica+Bell-Haunt)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilica+Bell-Haunt)
Basilica Bell-Haunt  

WWBB  

Creature — Spirit  

3/4  

When Basilica Bell-Haunt enters the battlefield, each opponent discards a card and you gain 3 life.


* You gain 3 life even if some or all of your opponents can't discard a card.



---

![Bedeck // Bedazzle](https://media.wizards.com/2018/rna/en_beYdLB29uu_side.png)


Bedeck  

b/rb/r  

Instant  

Target creature gets +3/-3 until end of turn.  

//  

Bedazzle  

4BR  

Instant  

Destroy target nonbasic land. Bedazzle deals 2 damage to target opponent or planeswalker.


* You can't cast Bedazzle without a target nonbasic land and a target opponent or planeswalker. If one of the targets is illegal when Bedazzle tries to resolve, the other is still affected as appropriate.



---

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Benthic+Biomancer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benthic+Biomancer)
Benthic Biomancer  

U  

Creature — Merfolk Wizard Mutant  

1/1  

1U: Adapt 1. *(If this creature has no +1/+1 counters on it, put a +1/+1 counter on it.)*  

Whenever one or more +1/+1 counters are put on Benthic Biomancer, draw a card, then discard a card.


* An ability that triggers when counters are put on a permanent will trigger if that permanent somehow enters the battlefield with those counters.
* You draw a card and discard a card all while Benthic Biomancer's triggered ability is resolving. Nothing can happen between the two, and no player may choose to take actions.



---

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Biogenic+Upgrade)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biogenic+Upgrade)
Biogenic Upgrade  

4GG  

Sorcery  

Distribute three +1/+1 counters among one, two, or three target creatures, then double the number of +1/+1 counters on each of those creatures.


* You choose how many targets Biogenic Upgrade has and how the counters are distributed as you cast it. Each target must receive at least one counter. This means, for example, that you can't target three creatures, assign them two, one, and zero counters.
* If some of the creatures are illegal targets as Biogenic Upgrade tries to resolve, the original distribution of counters still applies and the counters that would have been put on the illegal targets are lost. They won't be put instead on a legal target.
* To double the number of +1/+1 counters on a permanent, put a number of +1/+1 counters on it equal to the number it already has. Other cards that interact with putting counters on it will interact with this effect accordingly.



---

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Biomancer%27s+Familiar)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biomancer%27s+Familiar)
Biomancer's Familiar  

GU  

Creature — Mutant  

2/2  

Activated abilities of creatures you control cost 2 less to activate. This effect can't reduce the amount of mana an ability costs to activate to less than one mana.  

T: The next time target creature adapts this turn, it adapts as though it had no +1/+1 counters on it.


* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected by the cost reduction ability of Biomancer's Familiar.
* Biomancer's Familiar affects only abilities of creatures you control on the battlefield. The costs of activated abilities of creature cards that work in other zones (such as cycling) won't be reduced.
* An ability that has only one generic mana and some amount of other mana symbols in its activation cost will have its cost reduced by 1.
* The last ability of Biomancer's Familiar doesn't add or remove any counters. It just lets the creature adapt despite already having +1/+1 counters on it.



---

Bladebrand  

1B  

Instant  

Target creature gains deathtouch until end of turn.  

Draw a card.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Bladebrand tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You don't draw a card.



---

3RG  

Creature — Ogre Warrior  

4/4  

T, Remove a +1/+1 counter from a creature you control: Bolrac-Clan Crusher deals 2 damage to any target.


* You must remove exactly one +1/+1 counter from a creature you control to activate Bolrac-Clan Crusher's ability; you can't activate it without removing a +1/+1 counter, and you can't remove additional counters.



---

5BR  

Enchantment  

Captive Audience enters the battlefield under the control of an opponent of your choice.  

At the beginning of your upkeep, choose one that hasn't been chosen —  

• Your life total becomes 4.  

• Discard your hand.  

• Each opponent creates five 2/2 black Zombie creature tokens.


* Once Captive Audience is controlled by your opponent, its ability triggers during that player's upkeep and that player makes all choices for it. That player is affected by its first two modes, and that player's opponents create the tokens for its last mode.
* For a player's life total to become 4, that player gains or loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if a player's life total is 20, Captive Audience will cause that player to lose 16 life; alternatively, if their life total is 1, it will cause them to gain 3 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
* You may choose Captive Audience's first mode even if your life total is already 4. Similarly, you may choose its second mode even if you have no cards in hand.
* If all three modes have been chosen, Captive Audience's triggered ability is removed from the stack with no effect, but Captive Audience remains on the battlefield.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Captive Audience's first mode causes its controller to gain or lose life so that their team's life total becomes 4.
* In a multiplayer game, if Captive Audience's owner leaves the game, Captive Audience leaves the game with them. If Captive Audience's controller leaves the game, Captive Audience is exiled (assuming that player wasn't also Captive Audience's owner).

Cavalcade of Calamity  

1R  

Enchantment  

Whenever a creature you control with power 1 or less attacks, Cavalcade of Calamity deals 1 damage to the player or planeswalker that creature is attacking.


* A creature with power 0 or less can attack, as long as no rule or effect prohibits it from doing so. Many creatures with 0 power have defender, but not all do.
* The power of the attacking creature is checked only when the ability triggers. Once it triggers, Cavalcade of Calamity will deal 1 damage to the appropriate player or planeswalker even if the creature's power changes or the creature leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves.
* If multiple creatures you control with power 1 or less attack, Cavalcade of Calamity's ability will trigger for each of those creatures. Each ability will cause Cavalcade of Calamity to deal 1 damage to the appropriate player or planeswalker.

As long as you control a Domri planeswalker, Charging War Boar gets +1/+1 and has trample. *(It can deal excess damage to the player or planeswalker it's attacking.)*


* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Charging War Boar may become lethal if Domri leaves the battlefield during that turn.

Cindervines  

RG  

Enchantment  

Whenever an opponent casts a noncreature spell, Cindervines deals 1 damage to that player.  

1, Sacrifice Cindervines: Destroy target artifact or enchantment. Cindervines deals 2 damage to that permanent's controller.


* Cindervines's triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* If the target permanent is an illegal target by the time Cindervines's activated ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. No player is dealt damage. If the target is legal but not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), its controller is dealt damage.
* Cindervines can be the target of its own activated ability. The ability won't resolve since it won't have a legal target, and no player will be dealt damage, but this does allow you to sacrifice Cindervines without another enchantment to target if you want to.

When Deputy of Detention enters the battlefield, exile target nonland permanent an opponent controls and all other nonland permanents that player controls with the same name as that permanent until Deputy of Detention leaves the battlefield.


* This ability has only one target. The other permanents with that name aren't targeted. For example, a permanent with hexproof will be exiled if it has the same name as the target nonland permanent.
* If the target nonland permanent is an illegal target by the time this ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. Nothing is exiled.
* If Deputy of Detention leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, nothing is exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled permanents will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanents will cease to exist.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
* The name of a creature token is the same as the creature types specified as it was created, unless the token is a copy of another creature or the effect that created the token specifically gives it a different name.

* Effects that allow you to "cast" a card don't allow you to play a land card.
* If the target is dealt lethal damage this way, it will still be on the battlefield while you cast a card from your hand. It won't die until after Electrodominance is entirely finished resolving. If any of its abilities trigger while you cast that spell, those abilities will trigger but won't resolve until after the target has died.
* You may cast a sorcery or permanent spell this way even if it's not your turn.
* If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Bankrupt in Blood, those must be paid to cast the card.

When Forbidding Spirit enters the battlefield, until your next turn, creatures can't attack you or a planeswalker you control unless their controller pays 2 for each of those creatures.

* While Forbidding Spirit's effect is in effect, your opponents can choose not to pay to attack with a creature that attacks "if able." If there's no other player or planeswalker to attack, that creature simply doesn't attack.
* Forbidding Spirit's effect continues until your next turn even if Forbidding Spirit leaves the battlefield before then.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, creatures can attack your teammate and planeswalkers your teammate controls without requiring a mana payment.

When Galloping Lizrog enters the battlefield, you may remove any number of +1/+1 counters from among creatures you control. If you do, put twice that many +1/+1 counters on Galloping Lizrog.


* You remove counters and put new ones on Galloping Lizrog all while its ability is resolving. Nothing can happen between the two, and no player may choose to take actions.
* If Galloping Lizrog leaves the battlefield after its ability has triggered, you may remove any number of +1/+1 counters from among your creatures, even though you won't put any on Galloping Lizrog.
* If an effect causes Galloping Lizrog to enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, you may remove those counters with its triggered ability and put twice as many back on it.

Whenever Gruul Beastmaster attacks, another target creature you control gets +X/+0 until end of turn, where X is Gruul Beastmaster's power.


* The value of X is determined only as Gruul Beastmaster's triggered ability resolves. Once that happens, the value of X won't change later in the turn even if Gruul Beastmaster's power changes.
* If Gruul Beastmaster leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, use its power as it last existed on the battlefield to determine the value of X.
* If Gruul Beastmaster's power is negative as its triggered ability resolves, X is considered to be 0. In other words, that ability can't cause the creature to lose power.

Enchantment  

Whenever a nontoken creature enters the battlefield under your control, if it doesn't have the same name as another creature you control or a creature card in your graveyard, draw a card.


* Whether the entering creature shares a name with a creature you control or a creature card in your graveyard is checked both as that creature enters and as Guardian Project's ability resolves. If the entering creature isn't the first of its name as it enters, the ability doesn't trigger at all; if its name is shared as the ability resolves, you don't draw a card.
* If the entering creature is put into your graveyard while Guardian Project's ability is on the stack, that same card will be a creature card in your graveyard that shares a name with the creature that was on the battlefield, so you won't draw a card.
* If the entering creature leaves the battlefield and returns while Guardian Project's ability is on the stack, that same card will be a new creature you control that shares a name with the creature that was on the battlefield, so you won't draw a card. However, Guardian Project's ability may trigger for the new creature and you may draw a card as that ability resolves.

Whenever an opponent activates an ability of an artifact, creature, or land that isn't a mana ability, Immolation Shaman deals 1 damage to that player.  

3RR: Immolation Shaman gets +3/+3 and gains menace until end of turn.


* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text (such as equip does). An activated mana ability is one that produces mana as it resolves, not one that costs mana to activate.
* Immolation Shaman's first ability doesn't trigger when an opponent activates an ability of a card in hand (such as cycling) or a card in a graveyard (such as that of Bone Dragon), even if that causes a card to be put onto the battlefield.
* Immolation Shaman's first ability resolves before the ability that caused it to trigger.
* Activating Immolation Shaman's second ability after one creature has blocked it won't cause Immolation Shaman to become unblocked.

* The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
* Any change to a land's type or abilities gained by a land can affect the types of mana a land can produce.
* Incubation Druid checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands you control, but it doesn't check their costs or legality. For example, Spire of Industry says "T, Pay 1 life: Add one mana of any color. Activate this ability only if you control an artifact." If you control Spire of Industry and Incubation Druid, you can tap Incubation Druid for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether you control an artifact, whether you can pay 1 life, or whether Spire of Industry is untapped.
* Incubation Druid doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your lands put on the mana they produce, such as those of Unclaimed Territory and Guildmages' Forum. It just produces one mana of the appropriate type, with no restrictions or riders.

Each opponent can't cast noncreature spells with converted mana cost greater than the number of lands that player controls.

* Effects that modify or replace the cost to cast a spell (such as spectacle) don't affect the spell's converted mana cost, so they won't change whether Lavinia's first ability restricts that spell from being cast.
* For spells with X in their mana costs, use the value chosen for X to determine the spell's converted mana cost.
* If an effect allows a player to cast a spell without paying its mana cost, that player can't choose to cast it and pay its mana cost unless another rule or effect allows that player to cast it that way.

If you exile a land card, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.
* Casting an exiled card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.

Whenever a nontoken creature enters the battlefield under your control, flip a coin until you lose a flip. For each flip you won, create a token that's a copy of that creature. Those tokens gain haste. Exile them at the beginning of the next end step.


* All of the tokens enter the battlefield at the same time.
* Each token copies exactly what is printed on the creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If the copied creature is copying something else, each token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature is copying.
* If the copied creature has X in its mana cost, X is 0.
* If the entering creature leaves the battlefield before Mirror March's ability resolves, use that creature's last known existence on the battlefield to determine the token's characteristics.

A deck can have any number of cards named Persistent Petitioners.


* Advisors that you haven't controlled continuously since your turn began may be tapped to pay for the second ability of Persistent Petitioners.
* It's not possible to tap one Persistent Petitioners to activate both its first and second ability, or to activate its second ability and that of another Persistent Petitioners. This means that if you tap four Persistent Petitioners, the target player loses the top twelve cards of their library, not the top forty-eight.
* The last ability of Persistent Petitioners lets you ignore the "four-of" rule. It doesn't let you ignore format legality. For example, during a *Ravnica Allegiance* Limited event, you can't add Persistent Petitioners from your personal collection, no matter how much they ask.

When Plaza of Harmony enters the battlefield, if you control two or more Gates, you gain 3 life.  

T: Add C.  

T: Add one mana of any type that a Gate you control could produce.


* The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
* Any additions to a Gate's land types or abilities gained by a Gate can affect the types of mana a Gate can produce.
* Plaza of Harmony checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of Gates you control, but it doesn't check their costs or legality. For example, it doesn't check whether a Gate is untapped.

T, Sacrifice two other creatures: Any number of target players each lose 2 life and sacrifice a creature. You add BB and draw a card.


* You can activate the ability of Priest of Forgotten Gods without choosing any targets if you wish. You'll still add BB and draw a card.
* You may target players who can't sacrifice a creature. Those players still lose 2 life.
* Because it may have targets, the ability of Priest of Forgotten Gods isn't a mana ability. It uses the stack and can be responded to, even if no targets were chosen.

T, Sacrifice another creature: Search your library for a creature card with converted mana cost equal to 1 plus the sacrificed creature's converted mana cost, put that card onto the battlefield, then shuffle your library. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.


* If a creature or a creature card in your library has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* Tokens that aren't a copy of something else don't have a mana cost. Anything without a mana cost normally has a converted mana cost of 0.

When Rakdos Firewheeler enters the battlefield, it deals 2 damage to target opponent and 2 damage to up to one target creature or planeswalker.


* If you can't target any opponent with Rakdos Firewheeler's ability, the ability doesn't go on the stack. You can't have it deal 2 damage to any creature or planeswalker. On the other hand, if you do choose legal targets but either target is illegal when the ability tries to resolve, the other is still affected as appropriate.

When Rakdos, the Showstopper enters the battlefield, flip a coin for each creature that isn't a Demon, Devil, or Imp. Destroy each creature whose coin comes up tails.


* Players can't take any action between the time that coins are flipped and the time creatures are destroyed. For example, if they wish to cast a spell to have a creature gain indestructible, they must do so before Rakdos's triggered ability resolves, without knowing whether that creature's coin will come up heads or tails.
* All of the creatures whose coins come up tails are destroyed at the same time.

Destroy all artifacts and enchantments. For each permanent destroyed this way, its controller creates a 3/3 green Centaur creature token.


* All of the artifacts and enchantments that are destroyed leave the battlefield before any Centaurs are created, and their abilities can't affect or trigger on these tokens entering the battlefield.
* If a permanent has indestructible, it isn't destroyed this way and its controller won't create a Centaur token for it. If it is destroyed but put into a zone other than a graveyard, its controller does create a Centaur token for it.

Riot *(This creature enters the battlefield with your choice of a +1/+1 counter or haste.)*  

When Ravager Wurm enters the battlefield, choose up to one —  

• Ravager Wurm fights target creature you don't control.  

• Destroy target land with an activated ability that isn't a mana ability.


* You may choose neither mode for Ravager Wurm's triggered ability. In this case, the ability is removed from the stack with no effect.
* If the target of Ravager Wurm's first mode isn't a legal target as that ability resolves, or if Ravager Wurm has left the battlefield, neither creature will deal or be dealt damage.
* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. An activated mana ability is one that produces mana as it resolves, not one that costs mana to activate.

Counter target activated or triggered ability. *(Mana abilities can't be targeted.)*  

//  

Replicate  

1GU  

Sorcery  

Create a token that's a copy of target creature you control.


* Activated abilities are written in the form "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as equip, are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts.
* Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as afterlife, are triggered abilities and will have "when," "whenever," or "at" in their reminder text.
* An activated mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool as it resolves, doesn't have a target, and isn't a loyalty ability. A triggered mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool and triggers on an activated mana ability.
* Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, can't be targeted. Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" are also replacement effects and can't be targeted.
* If you counter a delayed triggered ability that triggered at the beginning of the "next" occurrence of a specified step or phase, that ability won't trigger again the following time that phase or step occurs.
* The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* If the copied creature has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If the copied creature is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token.
* If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is a Mirror Image), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.

Double your life total. Target opponent loses half their life, rounded up.


* If a card in a graveyard has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* To double a player's life total, that player gains as much life as needed so that their life total is twice the number it was before. If their life total was negative, that player loses as much life as needed so that their life total is twice as far below 0 as it was before. Other effects interact with this life gain or loss accordingly.

1RG  

Enchantment  

Creature spells you control can't be countered.  

Nontoken creatures you control have riot. *(They enter the battlefield with your choice of a +1/+1 counter or haste.)*


* A spell or ability that counters spells can still target a creature spell you control. When that spell or ability resolves, the creature spell won't be countered, but any additional effects of that spell or ability will still happen.
* Once a creature with riot has entered the battlefield, it keeps its +1/+1 counter or haste even if it loses riot.
* If a nontoken, noncreature permanent becomes a creature after it's already on the battlefield, it will have riot but it will be too late for the replacement effect to have any effect.

When Rix Maadi Reveler enters the battlefield, discard a card, then draw a card. If Rix Maadi Reveler's spectacle cost was paid, instead discard your hand, then draw three cards.

6/5  

Rubblebelt Recluse attacks each combat if able.


* If Rubblebelt Recluse can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped or having come under that player's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.

5R  

Creature — Elemental  

6/6  

When Rumbling Ruin enters the battlefield, count the number of +1/+1 counters on creatures you control. Creatures your opponents control with power less than or equal to that number can't block this turn.


* The number of +1/+1 counters among creatures you control is counted only as Rumbling Ruin's ability resolves. The set of creatures that can't block is constantly updated as their power changes, but the number against which their power is compared doesn't change later in the turn, even if the number of +1/+1 counters among your creatures changes.
* Once a creature with high enough power has blocked, changing the power of the blocking creature won't remove the blocking creature from combat or cause the creature it blocked to become unblocked.
* If there are no +1/+1 counters on creatures you control as Rumbling Ruin's ability resolves, creatures with power 0 or less can't block this turn.

Destroy target creature with flying. Sagittars' Volley deals 1 damage to each creature with flying your opponents control.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Sagittars' Volley tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. No creatures are dealt damage. If the target is legal but not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), creatures with flying your opponents control are dealt damage, possibly including the target creature.
* Each creature with flying controlled by any of your opponents is dealt damage, even if that opponent didn't control the target creature with flying.

* If either target is an illegal target as Savage Smash resolves, neither creature will deal or be dealt damage.
* If the creature you control is an illegal target as Savage Smash tries to resolve, it won't get +2/+2. If that creature is a legal target but the other creature isn't, the creature you control still gets +2/+2.

* An ability that triggers when counters are put on a permanent will trigger if that permanent somehow enters the battlefield with those counters.
* If Simic Ascendancy doesn't have twenty or more growth counters on it as your upkeep begins, its last ability won't trigger. You can't take any actions during your turn before your upkeep begins.
* If the last ability does trigger, but counters are removed from Simic Ascendancy so it has fewer than twenty remaining on it, you won't win the game.
* If the last ability does trigger, but Simic Ascendancy leaves the battlefield, use the number of counters it had on it immediately before it left the battlefield to determine whether you win the game.

In other words, as you activate the ability, you choose whether to have Skarrgan Hellkite deal 2 damage to a single target, or deal 1 damage to each of two targets.
* If Skarrgan Hellkite's ability has two targets and one becomes illegal, the remaining target is dealt 1 damage, not 2.

Territorial Boar  

1G  

Creature — Boar  

2/2  

Whenever a creature with power 4 or greater enters the battlefield under your control, Territorial Boar gets +1/+1 and gains vigilance until end of turn.


* The entering creature must have power 4 or greater as it enters the battlefield, or Territorial Boar's ability won't trigger. Static abilities that raise (or lower) a creature's power are taken into account. However, you can't have a creature with power 3 or less enter the battlefield, raise its power with a spell, an activated ability, or a triggered ability, and have Territorial Boar's ability trigger.
* If the entering creature's power changes to 3 or less after it has entered the battlefield, Territorial Boar still gets +1/+1 and gains vigilance.
* If Territorial Boar's power is raised to 4 or greater as it enters the battlefield, it will cause its own ability to trigger.

Teysa Karlov  

2WB  

Legendary Creature — Human Advisor  

2/4  

If a creature dying causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.  

Creature tokens you control have vigilance and lifelink.


* Teysa affects a creature's own "when this creature dies" triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that trigger when that creature dies. Such triggered abilities start with "when" or "whenever."
* Teysa's effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to pay a cost for that triggered ability, are also made separately.
* The trigger event doesn't have to specifically refer to "creatures." In these cases, the trigger event may also refer to something being "put into a graveyard from the battlefield." For example, an ability that triggers "whenever an artifact is put into a graveyard from the battlefield" would trigger twice if an artifact creature dies while Teysa Karlov is on the battlefield.
* An ability that triggers when a creature "leaves the battlefield" will trigger twice if that creature leaves the battlefield by dying.
* An ability that triggers on an event that causes a creature to die doesn't trigger twice. For example, an ability that triggers "whenever you sacrifice a creature" triggers only once.
* Look at each creature as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger multiple times. For example, if a land that has become a creature dies, an ability that triggers when it dies triggers twice.
* If a creature dying at the same time that another permanent you control leaves the battlefield causes a triggered ability of that permanent to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
* If a creature dying at the same time as Teysa (including Teysa itself dying) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
* If you somehow control two Teysas, a creature dying causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Teysa causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on. This also means that if you control Teysa and cast a second one, an ability that triggers when it dies due to the "legend rule" triggers three times.
* An ability of a permanent that triggers when a card is put into a graveyard "from anywhere" triggers twice only if Teysa and that permanent are both still on the battlefield immediately after the creature has died.

Theater of Horrors  

1BR  

Enchantment  

At the beginning of your upkeep, exile the top card of your library.  

During your turn, if an opponent lost life this turn, you may play cards exiled with Theater of Horrors.  

3R: Theater of Horrors deals 1 damage to target opponent or planeswalker.


* Damage dealt to a player causes that player to lose that much life.
* Theater of Horrors doesn't change when you can play the exiled cards during your turn. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty. If you exile a land card, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.
* Casting an exiled card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.
* In a multiplayer game, if an opponent loses life during your turn and then leaves the game, you can play cards exiled with Theater of Horrors.

Tithe Taker  

1W  

Creature — Human Soldier  

2/1  

During your turn, spells your opponents cast cost 1 more to cast and abilities your opponents activate cost 1 more to activate unless they're mana abilities.  

Afterlife 1 *(When this creature dies, create a 1/1 white and black Spirit creature token with flying.)*


* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. An activated mana ability is one that produces mana as it resolves, not one that costs mana to activate. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected by Tithe Taker.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases (such as that of Tithe Taker's effect), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* An opponent's activated ability that costs no mana to activate will cost 1 plus its non-mana costs during your turn.

2W  

Instant  

Creatures you control gain indestructible until end of turn.  
*Addendum* — If you cast this spell during your main phase, put a +1/+1 counter on each of those creatures and they gain vigilance until end of turn.


* Unbreakable Formation affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't gain indestructible or vigilance and they won't get a +1/+1 counter.

Creature — Ogre Warrior

When Undercity Scavenger enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice another creature. If you do, put two +1/+1 counters on Undercity Scavenger, then scry 2.


* You choose whether to sacrifice a creature (and which one to sacrifice) while Undercity Scavenger's ability is resolving. No player may take actions between the time you choose which creature to sacrifice, the time Undercity Scavenger has +1/+1 counters on it, and the time you scry 2.
* You can't sacrifice multiple creatures to put more +1/+1 counters on Undercity Scavenger or to scry more.

Instant  

Target opponent sacrifices a creature. If you control a creature with power 4 or greater, you gain 4 life.


* You can still gain 4 life even if the target opponent can't sacrifice a creature.
* Whether you control a creature with power 4 or greater is checked only after your opponent has sacrificed a creature. If a creature you own with power 4 or greater was exiled until the sacrificed creature left the battlefield, that creature will return to the battlefield before the check, so it will count. However, any abilities that trigger on the sacrificed creature's death won't have resolved yet when you check what creatures you control.
* You gain only 4 life, even if you control more than one creature with power 4 or greater.

2U  

Enchantment  

Whenever a creature an opponent controls becomes tapped, if it isn't being declared as an attacker, you may draw a card.  

4U: Tap target creature without flying.


* For Verity Circle's first ability to trigger, the creature has to actually change from untapped to tapped. If an effect attempts to tap a tapped creature, but it was already tapped at the time, the ability won't trigger.
* If a creature enters the battlefield tapped, Verity Circle's first ability doesn't trigger.
* If a creature with vigilance is declared as an attacker and then becomes tapped while it's attacking, Verity Circle's first ability triggers.

Creature — Vampire

Whenever another creature you control dies, Vindictive Vampire deals 1 damage to each opponent and you gain 1 life.


* If Vindictive Vampire dies at the same time as one or more other creatures you control, Vindictive Vampire's ability triggers for each of those other creatures.
* If your life total is brought to 0 or less at the same time that creatures you control are dealt lethal damage, you lose the game before Vindictive Vampire's triggered ability goes on the stack.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Vindictive Vampire's ability causes the opposing team to lose 2 life and you gain 1 life.

Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game or the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat. Similarly, a "blocking creature" is one that has been declared as a blocker or put onto the battlefield blocking during this combat.
