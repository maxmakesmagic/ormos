After winning his quarterfinals, Caio Amaral remains the lone existing Blue player in the entire tournament. To say that might sound a little misleading, considering that he is also really playing with a bunch of Naya cards, including [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)!


Amaral's deck was probably the most unique in the Top 8. Aside from powering out early [Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft) and [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) via [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) and [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), he also had access to two copies of Retreat to Coralhem to steal wins.

Yet, the addition of this Battle for Zendikar uncommon did not comprise the essence of his deck, which is to win by combat. Even without [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary), Landfall triggers could tap down blockers or fix his future draw steps.


Vagner William Casatti's burn spells will seek to seal the deal quickly before Amaral can hold the fort and overpower him in the late game. With a plethora of cheap creatures, coupled with effective direct damage spells at his disposal, it is entirely possible for Casatti to “out-tempo” his opponent.


The games will be pretty fast! Don't blink!


Game 1
======


Casatti started out with double [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) and [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear), quickly applying pressure on Amaral. Even the least imaginative players should comprehend how scary this opening really is.

*Vagner Wiliam Casatti is loving his [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide)s!*


[Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft) wasn't the best blocker in the format, but [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) “could” hold back the fort. Regardless, the suicidal all-out attack from Casatti put Amaral at a low enough life total for [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel) to force him into a corner.


Amaral had no solution to it, and was took more than a couple of pings from it. Very often, an unanswered Eidolon is pretty much game over. Casatti wrapped things up with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt).

Game 2
======


I told you the games would go fast. In aggro matchups such as this one, stumbling on mana can usually be the Achilles Heel.


Casatti was forced to go on the defensive this time, because he was most unfortunately stuck on one land. When the burn player is killing creatures defensively, that's usually a tell-tale sign that he's behind.


Casatti used [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) to kill [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl), and pointed [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) at [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch). [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben) shut him out totally, until another suspended [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) killed it.

*Caio Amaral returns the favor with a pair of [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s.*


A pair of [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s convinced Casatti to move on to the third game.

Game 3
======


Now that he was on the draw, Amaral wasted no time pointing [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s at Casatti's [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) and [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), taking some damage from his manabase in the process.


When Amaral added [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) to the board, Casatti roasted it with [Searing Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze). [Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike) and [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command) put Amaral down to six life, while he tried to race with [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben) and [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer). Another [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command) and [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) later, and Casatti was through to the finals!


Despite Amaral having the early defense against Casatti's early creatures, he was burned out entirely!

Burn, baby, burn!
