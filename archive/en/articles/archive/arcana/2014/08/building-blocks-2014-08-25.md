If you haven't read today's [Making Magic](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mm/metamorphosis) on the changes coming to *Magic*'s block structure, stop reading right here, go read that, and come back when you're done.


It's okay, I'll wait.


Wow, right? That's *huge* news and a massive change to how we make *Magic* sets going forward. We're entirely positive it's going to be a fantastic step forward for the game, for Standard, and for players everywhere. But we also know it might take some time to wrap our collective heads around it.


That said, this isn't the first time we've tinkered with the block structure. In fact, for more than half of *Magic*'s history, we've been messing with the block structure formula, both at the beginning and for the last seven or so years.


Let's take a trip through blocks of yore to see what I mean and maybe get a bit more background on how we arrived at the "[Metamorphosis](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mm/metamorphosis)" Rosewater wrote about today.

*Ice Age*/*Alliances*/*Homelands*/*Coldsnap*—1995–1996, 2006
============================================================


Some of you might be familiar with *Ice Age* block thanks to the release of *Coldsnap* in 2006 (or because, like me, you've been around the game a long, long time), but that was such a seminal block in that it represents a number of pivots in how *Magic* worked.


First of all, prior to *Ice Age*/*Alliances*, the concept of a block didn't really exist. To be fair, it only kind of existed with these two sets (released in 1995 and 1996, respectively), but *Alliances* was the first set to build on a previous set, both in the story and in the mechanics. Every previous set took place on its own world with its own mechanics and flavor.


*Homelands* (1995) gets lumped in here because, for a time, it was a weird part of *Ice Age* block. It wasn't replaced until 2006 when *Coldsnap*, the "lost" third set of the block, was printed. *Homelands* is no longer part of the block—appropriately so, since the story and mechanics aren't related at all.


So, in some sense, *Ice Age* was the first block. Sort of.


*Mirage*/*Visions*/*Weatherlight*—1996–1997
===========================================


*Mirage* block is often considered the first "normal" block in that it was three sets tied together in some way. It does, however, feature a bit of a pivot with the third set, *Weatherlight*, taking the story in a completely different direction from the first two sets and mostly (but not entirely) abandoning the two main mechanics of the block: phasing and flanking. There were just four cards that mention [phase or phasing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=+%5b%22Weatherlight%22%5d&text=+%7C%5bphase%5d) in *Weatherlight* and a mere two that mentioned [flanking](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=+%5b%22Weatherlight%22%5d&text=+%7C%5bflank%5d). There were, oddly enough, 14 cards that mention [cumulative upkeep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=+%5b%22Weatherlight%22%5d&text=+%7C%5bcumulative%5d). But, hey, *Weatherlight* gave us [Ophidian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ophidian) and [Mind Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Stone), so we'll let it go.


What it also gave us was the kickoff to a story that would span the next four blocks, as well as a relative period of stability in the block structure.


*Tempest* Block, Urza's Block, Masques Block, *Invasion* Block, *Odyssey* Block, *Onslaught* Block, *Mirrodin* Block, Kamigawa Block, Ravnica Block—1997–2006
=============================================================================================================================================================


This is the period where we see most of the three-set block model. For nine blocks and nine years, the blocks followed a large-small-small pattern and came in threes. The first four blocks—*Tempest* block (1997–1998) through *Invasion* block (2000–2001)—followed the story of the *Weatherlight* crew as it sailed/flew around, did some stuff for Urza, and then defeated Yawgmoth. *Odyssey* block (2001–2002) and *Onslaught* block (2002–2003) shared a story, but were otherwise separate mechanically. The final three stood on their own.


Then things got funky.


*Coldsnap*—2006
===============


*Coldsnap*, as we said before, was released in 2006 and completed the *Ice Age* block...nearly a decade later.


*Time Spiral* Block—2006-2007
=============================


*Time Spiral* was, temporarily, back to the three-set block model. That wouldn't last long.


*Lorwyn*-*Shadowmoor* Block—2007–2008
=====================================


This is the first—and so far only—four-set block, featuring a pivot in the middle for both the story (same plane, but flipped to basically its evil/opposite version) and mechanics. The sets were not all drafted together. Instead, *Lorwyn* (2007) and *Morningtide* (2008) were drafted together while *Shadowmoor* (2008) was drafted with *Eventide* (2008). For Constructed purposes, they're all one block.


*Shards of Alara* Block—2008–2009
=================================


And, once again, temporarily back to the typical three-set block.


*Zendikar* Block—2009-2010
==========================


And, once again, back to the atypical block. Here, the block is still three sets, but with a third-set pivot. *Zendikar* (2009) and *Worldwake* (2010) were drafted together, but *Rise of the Eldrazi* was a large set that was drafted on its own. For Constructed purposes, they're all played together.


*Scars of Mirrodin* Block—2010–2011
===================================


Besides being our first "return to" block, *Scars of Mirrodin* block is a normal three-set, large-small-small block. Nothing to see here, moving on.


*Innistrad* Block—2011–2012
===========================


Like *Zendikar* before it, *Innistrad* block is large-small-large, with the final set drafted on its own but all three sets contributing to Block Constructed. It's a little bit notable that *Innistrad* block is the first Block Constructed format to have cards banned in it since *Mirrodin*—[Intangible Virtue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intangible+Virtue) and [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls). It also gave the world [Mist Raven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Raven), so in my book we're cool.


*Return to Ravnica* Block—2012–2013
===================================


In another first, *Return to Ravnica* (2012) is large and was drafted alone. *Gatecrash* (2013)—the second set in the block—is also a large set and was also drafted alone. The third set, *Dragon's Maze* (2013), is small and was only drafted with the full block of three sets. Funky.


*Theros* Block—2013–2014
========================


Which brings us up to (nearly) today. *Theros* block is back to a "normal" three-set block...only, as we learned today, that's no longer the norm. But if we've learned anything today, it's that the norm isn't so normal.
