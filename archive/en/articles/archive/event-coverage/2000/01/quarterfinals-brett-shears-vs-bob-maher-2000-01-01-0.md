![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/642.jpg)Brett has a solid W-B deck with multiple [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire)s and [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer)s. Maher has a strong W-U deck with many early drops and a couple bombs. Brett also main decked two [Execute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Execute)s for the match which are very strong considering most of Maher's creatures are white. 


### Game 1


Maher wins the die roll and plays first. Maher plays a turn two [Mystic Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Visionary) and its countered by a turn two [Angelic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall). On turn three Maher casts [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) and misses a land drop. Shears plays a [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer) on his turn and tries to capitalize on Maher's mana screw. Maher then draws two lands in a row and lays two [Nomad Decoy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomad+Decoy)s. The board is locked up in this game by about turn five. Maher plays out a few small creatures and with the help of the decoys attacks for one with the [Cephalid Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Scout). Shears then casts an [Infected Vermin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infected+Vermin). He then prevented two damage to the [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer) with itself and changed his mind about sacking the vermin so he passed the turn with the mistake.![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/641.jpg) At the end of Shears next turn, Maher taps his healer and Shears makes a shield for his vermin. At the attempt to tap Shear's [Aven Flock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock), Shears then does one damage to all creatures, killing Maher's Visionary and [Cephalid Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Scout) at the cost of his own [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer). Maher untaps and passes his turn. Shears gets his Wererat and Flock tapped down but sends with the vermin. After Maher blocks with his [Patrol Hound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patrol+Hound)s Shears activates the vermin twice to kill all of Maher's creatures. Maher had just enough mana up to cast [Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter) on one of his Nomads. Maher untapped and played a [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot) and a fifth land. Shears can't attack through a Zealot and played a [Zombie Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Assassin). Maher played a second Zealot and has firm control of the game. A [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer) played by Maher gets [Zombie Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Assassin)ated. Shears attacks for some damage and lays an [Aven Cloudchaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser). Maher plays out a [Pianna, Nomad Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pianna%2C+Nomad+Captain) and passes the turn. Both players lay creatures for the next few turns with very little else happening. Shears finally has drawn a [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire) for the [Nomad Decoy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomad+Decoy) and it looks like he may be able to attack a few times. Maher surprisingly attacks with all of his creatures; the [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot), [Pianna, Nomad Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pianna%2C+Nomad+Captain), and [Dreamwinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder). Shears blocks and kills the captain and kills the Zealot with a [Gallantry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gallantry). Maher is in very bad shape now with Shears having a threshold powering up the [Wererat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wererat) and many Swamps to pump his [Whispering Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Shade). Maher has nothing he can draw to not lose here and he concedes.


### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/643.jpg)Maher elects to play as his deck has many two drops and with a quick start the deck can be very overpowering. Both players keep their hands and start laying lands over the first few turns. An [Angelic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall) and [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer) shows up for Shears and a [Nomad Decoy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomad+Decoy) shows up for Maher just as it did in the first game. Maher plays out a few more creatures but can't attack through the healer and the wall for a little while. Maher is playing the deck very aggressively and is tapping blockers and the healer instead of offensive creatures that may be a problem. Shears [Execute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Execute)d Maher's Zealot and then sends with [Whispering Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Shade) and [Zombie Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Assassin). Maher has no blocks and takes a total of seven sending him to eleven life. Maher finds [Kirtar's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kirtar%27s+Desire) to take care of the Shade and is safe for a while. Shears has some [Aven Cloudchaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser)s in his deck and if he plays one it could be huge. The next turn that is exactly what happens and Maher is back in bad shape. Maher plays the Captain and is done. The [Whispering Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Shade) comes over once again and can be as large as a 5/6 and have two damage prevented to it from the healer. Maher doesn't block and takes three damage going down to eight. Shears then [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire)s the [Nomad Decoy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomad+Decoy) practically taking Maher out of the match. Maher has no defense for the shade. After the [Zombie Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Assassin) takes out his [Aven Flock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock) and [Execute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Execute) takes out his [Aven Cloudchaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser), Maher has no defense at all left. An [Infected Vermin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infected+Vermin) seals the game for Shears.
