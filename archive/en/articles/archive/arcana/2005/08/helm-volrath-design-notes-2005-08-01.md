We've [seen before](/en/articles/archive/mark-rosewaters-design-notes-2004-09-30) how Mark Rosewater carries with him a piece of well-worn paper to jot down **Magic** card ideas. One of these ideas was "Helm of Volrath," the card that eventually [became *Mirrodin's* Mindslaver](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr89).

*Mark Rosewater's design notes: "Helm of Possession"*


In this scan you can see that he titled the card "Helm of Possession" in his notes; it was to become a splashy "marquee" card for *Tempest*. Instead the name [Helm of Possession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Possession), and the concept of a powerful helm belonging to Volrath, became attached to this creature-stealing artifact:

Interestingly, as you can see from its art, [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) was still concepted as a mind-control helmet.
