The Parun of the Izzet League, as an grand and brilliant [dragon](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mc21), deserves an equally grand and brilliant guild-hall. That hall-slash-dragon's-lair is known as Nivix, its name of course inspired by Niv-Mizzet himself.

Martina Pilcerova's submitted art for this card (a card you'll likely get to see in cardboard glory at the [prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/prerelease/guildpact)) originally featured one additional detail. The art team liked that detail but thought it appeared out of scale to the guild-hall so it was removed. Would you like to [see it](#image)? (Or [flip back](#image) again?)
