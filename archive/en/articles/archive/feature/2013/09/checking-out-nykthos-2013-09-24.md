This week's Friday Night **Magic** is going to be awesome. *Theros* hits the shelves and you can take part in the second phase of the Hero's Path! At your store you'll find a slightly altered poster of [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx), and it is in the alteration that you'll have to seek the aid of the gods of Theros for help on your quest.


The art in *Theros* is truly stunning and this card is a great example of it. The unobstructed view of Nyx is noted in the art description as "sacred ground, the place where worshippers can see their gods most clearly." And looking at this art, it is clear why. The Nyx sky is breathtaking to behold even in card form; imagine seeing it in person!
