One of the great things about Limited Pro Tours is seeing how the pros value different cards. I don't mean the minor pick order differences from player to player, but rather the sort of out of the blue deviation from conventional wisdom. Playing the kinds of cards that cause spectators to go wide-eyed with shock. Draft picks that leave people choking with surprise.

![Battlefield Medic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Battlefield+Medic)This weekend, Brian Kibler wowed spectators by first picking [Battlefield Medic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic) and never looking back. It's been whispered since the release of *Legions* that Black-White had become the best archetype, and Kibler was giving a master class on how to draft it. The Medic is nothing short of essential, he says, ensuring that your [Vile Deacon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Deacon)s become unstoppable. It even merits more attention than [Daunting Defender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender) because of the way it mangles your opponent's early-game combat. Rich Hoaen, who 7-0'd the first day thanks to black-white Clerics, had a similar experience. He first picked [Cruel Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival), then got handed a pack with [Barkhide Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler). He didn't even blink as he sent it to the back in favor of the lowly Medic. The rewards were many many quality late picks.

But if the rising stock of the Medic as a result of the black-white Clerics archetype is a surprise, eyebrows should be going through the roof as a result of Jeff Cunningham's latest endorsement: [Trickery Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trickery+Charm).

![Trickery Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Trickery+Charm)Yes, [Trickery Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trickery+Charm), the most hated of all the Charms. Cunningham is playing it, and playing it proudly. He'll try to tell you about all the things it does. First off, it's Jump, which can let you go to the face for a quick three or surprise an incoming flier. The type-changing ability can counter [Cruel Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival) and [Piety Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piety+Charm), as well as a couple other tricks. In a topdecking situation, rigging the top four of your library can take care of business. Says Cunningham, "[Trickery Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trickery+Charm) flat-out won me a game." He describes the situation as him with nothing but lands and an [Erratic Explosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion) in hand, a flier on board versus his opponent's pair of guys. He drew the Charm and checked the top four. [Backslide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Backslide), land, land, [Aven Fateshaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fateshaper). He reset the cards, blew up one of the dorks, clearing away the lands, and then rode Fateshaper to victory. Not bad at all.
