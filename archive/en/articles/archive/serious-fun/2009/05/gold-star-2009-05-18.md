![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/sf/sf39_scale.jpg)It's Solid Gold Week! What does that mean? No, we're not going to talk about carats and troy ounces (although I did once calculate whether some **Magic** cards might be [worth their weight in gold](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/askwizards/0407#gold)). This week is all about *Alara Reborn*, pretty gold borders, and cards that take two colors to cast.

I've [written in the past](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/2) about the ten two-color, "mono-multicolored" decks my friend Laura put together from my collection. They started out, before *Shards of Alara* was released, as *Ravnica* / *Shadowmoor* decks. Since then, I've been updating, most recently with all the golden goodies in *Alara Reborn*.
