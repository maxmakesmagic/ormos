The ruins of Aoba Castle are now the centerpiece of a large public park.

 Sendai is also renowned for its proximity to Matsushima. Some 260 islands, large and small, are scattered in picturesque Matsushima Bay. The view of Matsushima changes from place to place and from season to season, and is so beautiful that it is considered one of Japan's "Three Legendary Vistas" (the other two being Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima and the Ama-no-Hashidate in Kyoto). Dotted with small islands covered by black and red pines and grayish white rocks, the views of Matsushima Bay from the four islands of Ogi-ga-tani, Tomi-yama, Otaka-mori, and Tamon-zan are truly spectacular and regarded as the four grandest views in Matsushima. With its stunning island scenery, the bay is frequented by visitors year round. 

*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Grand Prix–Sendai will be run over two days using modified Swiss-style rounds of 50 minutes each. The number of rounds on Day 1 will be determined based on the number of players registered. Players will be paired randomly against players with similar win-loss records, with match points accumulating throughout the event.
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff round.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.

**Judges**
  
 The head judge for Grand Prix–Sendai will be announced at a later date. If you are interested in volunteering for Grand Prix–Sendai as a judge, please contact Ron Foster ([ron.foster@wizards.com](mailto:ron.foster@wizards.com)) by April 24, 2010.

* The **Magic: The Gathering** Tournament Rules and the **Magic: The Gathering** Infraction Procedure Guide are in effect for this event unless specifically overruled by information in this Format Document. Rules documents can be found in the [DCI Document Center](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home).
* Players must bring pen, paper, card sleeves and appropriate counters.
* In the event that a player who wins an invitation to a Pro Tour stop at a Grand Prix has already qualified for an invitation, the invitation does not pass down under any circumstances. Previous qualification may be through a Qualifier tournament, through performance at a professional tournament, or by being an invited DCI player (valid upon the date of the official rank announcement for the appropriate professional tournament).

A player who has a bye in a round does not have to play a match in that round, but is treated as having won. A bye is normally given out to a player when there are an odd number of players in a round, but byes may also be rewarded to players for previous performance at a tournament or as a prize at a Trial tournament. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria *(Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players that accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds)*:

**Third-Round Byes**
  


* Players with a [Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) level of 4 or higher
* Players with a DCI Total rating of 2050 or higher. Byes are based on DCI Total ratings published on June 2, 2010.
* Winners of Grand Prix–Sendai Trial tournaments.

**Second-Round Byes** 
  


* Players with a [Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) level of 2 or 3
* Players with a DCI Total rating of 1950 or higher. Byes are based on DCI Total ratings published on June 2, 2010.

**First-Round Byes** 
  


* Players with a [Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) level of 1
* Players with a DCI Total rating of 1850 or higher. Byes are based on DCI Total ratings published on June 2, 2010.

**Trial winners**
  
 People who win a Trial event are awarded 3 byes in the Grand Prix that it feeds. Trial byes are not cumulative with other byes and do not pass down.
