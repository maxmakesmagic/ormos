1,900 players showed up bright and early yesterday morning for Grand Prix Madrid and after 9 rounds of Swiss, there are only six players remaining with a perfect 9-0 record.



 Looking over their lists, two things become clear: Firstly, we still don't see [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) at the very top of the field. Secondly, the format is wide open! Among the top decks we can find the most expected deck just once, a Blue-Red Delver (with a splash of white) piloted by (5) Ivan Floch, as well as old favorites like [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). [Slippery Bogle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slippery+Bogle)s, and Zoo.





*After this round, only 3 players will remain with a perfect record!*
