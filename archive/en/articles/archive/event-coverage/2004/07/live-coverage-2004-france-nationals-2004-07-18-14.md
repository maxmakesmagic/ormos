![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/frnat04/fm9_1.jpg)Coming into the round, Farid is on 7-1 and Mathias is two points back at 6-1-1. Although not well-known outside France Mathias has been to a handful of Pro Tours with his best finish being 35th. ### Game 1


Both players had a first turn [Arcbound Worker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker). Farid played a second turn [Myr Moonvessel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Moonvessel), Mathias had a rather better turn, playing a [Viridian Longbow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) and an [Auriok Glaivemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Glaivemaster). Farid saved the Moonvessel with a [Ferocious Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ferocious+Charge) to dig through his deck.


He obviously didn't find anything as he disgustedly scooped on his fourth turn, throwing down a hand of two [Viridian Acolyte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Acolyte)s, an [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) which he had no [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to cast, and a [Tangle Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Golem).

### Game 2


Veron wasted no time in fetching his [Viridian Longbow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) with [Steelshaper's Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steelshaper%27s+Gift) on turn one. He cast a [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) on turn 2 while Farid did nothing until a turn 4 [Tangle Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Golem). Veron gave it a [Stasis Cocoon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Cocoon) and made a Denguard as well.


Farid explained why he was playing [Myr Moonvessel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Moonvessel)s and so on when he played [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). He equipped it and then [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)ed his own Golem to draw some cards. This gave him a [Turn to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Dust) for the Longbow. He dropped a [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage), fetched the mighty Moonvessel, and Clamped it away. The Raise tokens and a Denguard had dropped him to eleven in the meantime, so he had to do something.


Veron played a [Loxodon Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Mystic) and passed the turn. Farid drew a bunch of cards with an Acolyte and a Worker dying to the Clamp, but didn't actually improve his board position. The next attack dropped him to eight. Mathias played a Glaivemaster and a [Fleshgrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshgrafter). Farid used [Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) on the Mystic to buy him some time and dropped a Tel-Jilad Archer, Veron didn't attack and just replayed the Mystic.


Meraghni untapped and played [Memnarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch). Veron no longer had any sensible attacks so he just dropped a [Taj-Nar Swordsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taj-Nar+Swordsmith). He didn't fetch any equipment as Farid could just steal it with [Memnarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch). Meraghni only had two [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s in play, but he used [Pentad Prism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentad+Prism) to produce another and steal Veron's Mystic with [Memnarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch). Mathias thought for a while and scooped.

### Game 3


These two obviously had a lot of one drops as once again they each had one. Mathias made a Glaivemaster and Farid an [Arcbound Worker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker). Veron gave the Glaivemaster a [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) and attacked, Meraghni had [Turn to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Dust) in hand but no [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest).


He didnt find one immediately so Veron got a hit in and played [Battered Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battered+Golem). Farid's next draw step yielded a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) which let him Turn the Plating to Dust and then [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) the Golem. The game was played at a frantic pace. Veron's Specter's Shorud was [Echoing Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Ruin)ed and Farid began to attack with Worker, Shaman, and a [Goblin Archaeologist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Archaeologist).


Veron dropped a War Wagon to stabilize the ground but Farid drew a [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) and fetched his [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). He put it on the Archaelogist before trying to destroy the Wagon with it. He failed to, but drew two cards for his efforts. Mathias played a Longbow and shot the Worker with it.


Farid cycled through an Acolyte with Clamp, then equipped it to his Shaman and attacked for 3, [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)ed the Longbow and moved the clamp to the [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage). The card advantage for Farid was immense, but he was only on eight. Veron [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)ed the Mage and attacked with War Wagon and Glaivemaster to knock Farid to 4. Farid attacked back with the Shaman to put Mathias on 6 and played a [Tel-Jilad Outrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Outrider) and a [Tangle Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Golem). Veron had nothing left and conceded after trading his two remaining creatures for a Clamped [Tangle Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Golem).
