GRAND PRIX NIIGATA 2005
-----------------------


Godo's Gifts Keeps on Giving!
=============================




July 22-24












[日本語の取材へ](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/gifts-ungiven-keeps-giving-2005-07-22)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpnii05/fin.jpg)[Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) Keeps on Giving. At the beginning of this Grand Prix, the Japanese pros stated they felt [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) was clearly the best deck in the format and by a large margin. Twenty-two instances of the complex control deck made Day 2 here, with five of them occupying Top 8 slots -- three of which were designed by Katsuhiro Mori (who calls his particular version "Godo's Gifts") including the deck designer himself. Joining Mori in this experienced Top 8 were teammates Kenji Tsumura and Masashi Oiso, as well as Akira Asahara, Ryoma Shiozu, Takuya Oosawa, Suhan Yoon, and amateur Tomohiro Aridome.


Aridome was impressive in making it to the finals, sweeping both Shiozu and Oiso to set up a match against Katsuhiro Mori (who was practically unbeatable all weekend). Mori squeaked past Oosawa in the quarters and mounted a comeback against Asahara in the semis to make it to his first individual premiere event finals in some time. Unfortunately for Aridome his luck had finally run out, and Mori rolled right over him in two quick games, though the amateur tried to battle for as long as possible. Meloku and posse got in the final points of damage to deliver Katsuhiro Mori his first individual Grand Prix title!

**How old are you, where do you live, and what do you do for a living?**  



**What have been some of your major playing accomplishments?**  



**What kind of preparations did you do for this event? Did you playtest with anyone?**  



**Tell us about your deck. Anything special?**  

It's Gifts control deck, but we added red to the sideboard, which allows it to transform into a Godo deck.


**Out of the decks you saw this weekend, which one impressed you most?**  

Katsuhiro Mori's deck.


**What do you think about the Pro Player's Club and next year's Pro Tour schedule?**  

Nothing, really.

I made a bad play mistake during a feature match that cost me the game. Still, this Top 8 will make me Level 5 in the Player's Club, so I'm very happy.

Sunday, July 24: 4:20 pm - Quarterfinals: Masashi Oiso vs. Kenji Tsumura
------------------------------------------------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpnii05/qf_tsumura.jpg)*Kenji Tsumura*
Before the tournament began, Keita Mori informed me that Kenji Tsumura and Masashi Oiso had teamed up for at least the summertime while Oiso is on break from his engineering program. I said something pithy at that point like, "Well, it's not as if they can get much better." Of course now they find themselves facing each other in the Top 8 with Tsumura not having lost a match all tournament, though he does sport four draws to his name. The deck matchup for this one is a seventy-five card pure mirror, since the two players are running Katsu Mori's Godo's Gifts design.


Normally for coverage we would float among all four matches for the quarterfinals here, but it's rare that you get a sanctioned match between two of the consensus top 5 players in the world, particularly not in the Top 8, so we'll keep it locked right here instead to inform you of the happenings.


Tsumura won the dieroll but seemed dismayed because it forced him to give up his preferred side on the playmat. The first four turns for both players consisted of mana accelerants and nothing else until Oiso played a turn 5 [Kokusho, the Evening Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star). Tsumura cast one of his own on the next turn and they were off. Oiso followed Koko with Meloku on his next turn and then [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction) for Tsumura's Gifts, losing Meloku to [Sickening Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Shoal) along the way. The game stalled briefly while both players used their Tops and shuffle effects to dig for new salvos to fire in the battle. Oiso was the first to hit paydirt, finding a [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) to search out his [Hana Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) and the assorted loop parts ([Death Denied](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Denied), [Soulless Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless+Revival), and [Wear Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+Away) as an arcane spell). Tsumura wouldn't go away though, using [Death Denied](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Denied) to reload his hand after a Myojin counter wiped it from existence while Oiso did the same making the creature battle Meloku and a [Hana Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) vs. Kokusho and an Elder. Oiso again cast Gifts, this time getting Kokusho and [Goryo's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance) from his deck. Kenji took one more draw phase to search for an answer before admitting he was beaten.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpnii05/qf_oiso.jpg)*Masashi Oiso*
Oiso 1 - Tsumura 0


Game 2 was more of the same in the early turns, but Tsumura managed to accelerate directly to a channeled [Ghost-Lit Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker), taking a huge early lead. Sadly for all involved, Oiso snagged a Stalker of his own off the top of his deck and it was back to square one for both players. [Myojin of Night's Reach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myojin+of+Night%27s+Reach) for Oiso immediately died to a [Sickening Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Shoal) as the crowd began to wonder who might have a man survive long enough to win game 2. The answer looked to be Oiso, who again used [Death Denied](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Denied) to great effect while Kenji struggled once more to overcome Masashi's card advantage. It once again proved to be too much, as Oiso got a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) with [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) in play and began beating down, casting [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) to lock up the victory and delivering Tsumura his first loss of the weekend.


Oiso 2 - Tsumura 0


  

Sunday, July 24: 6:48 pm - Semifinals Roundup
---------------------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpnii05/sf_aridome.jpg)*Tomohiro Aridome*
**Masashi Oiso (Godo's Gifts) vs. Tomihiro Aridome (Mono-Blue Control)**  

Game 1 of this match finished about the time the other match started, as Mori took forever to finally send a very scrappy Takuya Oosawa home. Aridome managed to resolve an early [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) on Kagemaro and then buried Oiso under an avalanche of Azami-powered card advantage. By the end of the game Aridome had more counters in his hand than Oiso had spells in his hand and graveyard combined and eventually Meloku and his illusionary posse swung in for lethal damage.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpnii05/sf_oiso.jpg)*Masashi Oiso*
It took Oiso nearly an hour to lose what for the longest time looked like an unloseable game. Early on Aridome had no pressure and few counters in hand and Oiso's disruption picked him apart, but Masashi had no pressure of his own to push damage through and got Aridome to three life before the youngster made a complete recovery, eventually winning with no lands and only five cards left in his library. Oiso's loss squashes any thoughts of an Asahara vs. Oiso finals rematch from Matsuyama under the boot of inconvenient reality.


**Katsuhiro Mori (Godo's Gifts) vs. Akira Asahara (4-Color Gifts)**  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpnii05/sf_mori.jpg)*Katsuhiro Mori* Asahara won his quarterfinal quickly, but Mori took an hour and a half to win his, meaning Asahara had time to take a nap while waiting for Katsu to finish. Asahara chose to stay awake during that time making certain jetlagged coverage reporters and visiting artists rather jealous. Anyway, Asahara took down game 1 as quickly as a Gifts deck can during the mirror match, taking advantage of [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction), and unanswered Gifts, and some poor draws from Mori to notch and early lead in this match of contrasting styles. Mori is known as one of the fastest players on the Pro Tour and can sometimes be quite rude while hurrying his opponents along. Asahara is generally a very deliberate player in the style of a slightly faster Dave Humpherys - he'll eventually find the right play if he thinks about it long enough.


Katzuhiro had the upper hand in game 2 though, as Asahara found Godo's Gifts a bit too difficult to overcome, especially when he shows up to the party twice.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpnii05/sf_asahara.jpg)*Akira Asahara*
Mori proved that Godo is not strictly necessary for victory in game 3, but his Gifts can prove to be a beating, even if they are on a creature as small as a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). After Mori used [Myojin of Night's Reach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myojin+of+Night%27s+Reach) to obliterate Asahara's hand, he equipped his Elder with a Jitte and then the Dragon's Fang, sending Asahara's life total spiraling from 20 to zero in three swift swings.


Mori will now face Aridome for the championship.


  

Sunday, July 24: 8:05 pm - Finals: Tomohiro Aridome vs. Katsuhiro Mori
----------------------------------------------------------------------

After placing three of his own decks in the Top 8, Katsuhiro is the only one left surviving. He squeaked by a very game Takuya Oosawa in the quarterfinals, and then defeated Asahara in the semis and now faces a shocking non-[Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) deck in the finals. Amateur Tomohiro Aridome may be an unknown, but he's a member of team Asahara Union and playtests with some of the best players in Japan. This weekend that testing has really shown through, as Aridome piloted his Mono-Blue control deck through a very strong Top 8, first defeating Ryoma Shiozu in a mirror match and then roughing up Masashi Oiso in two excruciatingly long games before landing here in the finals. Regardless of the outcome, Aridome will take home a *very* healthy check from this event, as he will get finalist money and the top amateur prize as well.


Mori led off the game with a turn 1 [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) followed by [Kodama's Reach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) on turn 3, while Aridome played a turn 2 [Jushi Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jushi+Apprentice) and prepared to sit on his countermagic. Turn 4 gave Mori a tough decision - he had just grabbed [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) off the top of his deck to go along with a [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction) and [Kodama's Reach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) in hand, but he also had [Wear Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+Away) and [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) on the top of his deck that would get shuffled away if he cast the Reach. What do you play? Mori chose the obvious route and went for the Reach so that he could get more lands into play and start doubling up on spells cast each turn in order to get through Aridome's countermagic. He also used [Sickening Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Shoal) at the end of the next turn to get rid of the [Jushi Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jushi+Apprentice), but Aridome just cast a second one on the next turn leaving [Hinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinder) mana up. Mori simply shrugged himself and Shoaled the second one to boot.


Aridome drew and cast his third Apprentice of this game, prompting Mori to try and cast [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) at the end of the turn, but Aridome [Hinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinder)ed it to the bottom of the deck. Mori smiled as he was going to win that battle either way, casting Cranial Extractioin for Aridome's remaining [Hinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinder)s. This forced Aridome into action on the next turn, playing Azami to go along with his Apprentice so that he could start drawing back into action spells. [Myojin of Night's Reach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myojin+of+Night%27s+Reach) complicated that plan, leaving Aridome's entire hand vulnerable to the whim of whenever Mori decided he wanted to remove the counter. He did it during the next upkeep, earning five cards for his trouble for the measly counter.


Kagemaro then wiped the board clean, but Aridome earned a laugh from the crowd as he threw down his fourth and final Apprentice, keeping at least part of his card drawing engine alive. At this point Mori's deck decided it had had enough pussyfooting around and gave him another [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) to help put the game away. Mori went for the creature loop at this point, getting [Hana Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) and Meloku in his hand and [Death Denied](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Denied) plus [Soulless Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless+Revival) in the graveyard.

Aridome countered Meloku with [Minamo's Meddling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minamo%27s+Meddling) and then countered [Death Denied](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Denied) with an alt cast [Disrupting Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupting+Shoal), pitching a useless [Threads of Disloyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty). Mori had more gas on the next turn, flipping Ink-Eyes directly into play off the top of his deck, casting [Ghost-Lit Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) and then using [Sickening Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Shoal) plus the Stalker's ability on the next turn to get rid of Aridome's blocker and hand, attacking with Ink-Eyes for the concession.


Mori 1 - Aridome 0


Mori stared down a hand of black cards and [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s for game 2 and eventually decided to throw it back. Gifts needs a little kick start to get rolling in the early game and black cards ain't it. Hand number two was deemed an improvement until Mori whiffed on his second land drop, preventing him from casting the [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) in his hand. That was fixed a turn later, and Aridome's tap out to use [Journeyer's Kite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journeyer%27s+Kite) on Mori's next turn left him open to a free [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) from the kinetic former Rookie of the Year. Aridome gave Mori Meloku and [Kodama's Reach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) for his hand, shipping [Sickening Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Shoal) and a Top to the grumper. [Minamo's Meddling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minamo%27s+Meddling) countered Meloku on the next turn. The boys once again played draw, go for a few turns until Mori blew up Aridome's Kite with [Rending Vines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rending+Vines) at the end of turn and then tried to sneak through [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) only to see it [Hinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinder)ed. Four turns later Mori channeled [Ghost-Lit Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker), smashing Aridome's remaining hand and dreams of a comeback, opening the door for Meloku and giving Mori the victory and the match three swings later when Aridome's outs left him hanging.
