The September 9, 2016 Update

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 9, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by Cloudblazer. Every Daily *Magic* Update after this will also be brought to you by Cloudblazer. Because I limit myself to (approximately) one [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) reference per article, but I never said anything about Cloudblazer...


Today's Previews
================


For the previews not already found on DailyMTG, look no further than this section here. Well, click on the links below, but, no further than that. After that, you're good for the day.

This is the culmination of everything I have ever worked for. For every day spent covering a Grand Prix till midnight. For every weekend I worked at a Pro Tour. For moving across the country to take this job. And for talking about [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) at (not quite) every opportunity (I've been restrained). I now get to preview the (sort of) return of the five-mana, 2/2 flier that draws two cards. Sure, you can't evoke it, but why would you ever want to?


Will trade for all the foils.

And, yes, I'm salivating to cast this on my preview card above. Not sure what I'm talking about? Right, it's in Chinese.


The card is called Acrobatic Maneuver, and it exiles a creature you control, then returns it to play under its owner's control. Then you draw a card. I'm fairly certain we can teach Cloudblazer this particular Maneuver.

Affinity might not be the current bad guy in Pauper, but it's always nice to have tools to fight it. Oh, and I suppose this is Standard-, Modern-, Legacy-, and Vintage-legal now too.

As in "burning the." Having a personal [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) is pretty great, but this is an awfully steep drawback. Check out [a decent translation here](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/51vbkn/kldjapanese_card_need_translation/d7f6ml3).

I don't know. I don't speak Italian. But [this helpful internet person does](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/51u0zd/kld_need_translation_for_a_foreign_italian_spoiler/d7eujh9), and even gets the name (Dynavolt Charger) correct.


Also look for [an update to the *Magic: The Gathering* app](https://www.facebook.com/FaceToFaceGames/app/957366404318304/) on Facebook for today's preview card!


For a Good Cause
================


1. [Extra Life](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.team&teamID=29451)

Just a reminder that Wizards of the Coast will be helping to raise money with Extra Life, a charity event that benefits the Children's Miracle Network.


The 24-hour *Magic* stream will start next weekend, September 17, at 8 a.m. PT and will be hosted on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) for all 24 hours. All donations that come from this event will directly benefit the Seattle Children's Hospital.


There will be all kinds of events running that weekend (check out the list [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/daily-magic-update/update-2016-08-23)), and you can check out the donor page [here](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=29451).


We also want to encourage anyone interested in having their playgroup or local game store create their own Extra Life team to help raise money to do so by signing up at [extra-life.org](http://www.extra-life.org/) and then associating with our team page.


We'll also be giving away a lot of awesome prizes to viewers and people who donate, so certainly watch for that.


All of this is happening September 17–18 on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).


After All of That, Read This Too
================================


1. [Awakening Sleepers in Standard](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13501&writer=Craig+Wescoe&articledate=9-9-2016) | TCGPlayer | Craig Wescoe

Rotation is always a good time to re-examine some cards that just didn't quite make the cut when they were initially printed. Craig Wescoe is on top of what could be the next cards to break out in new Standard.


What People Are Talking About

There are a lot of tough teams headed to [Grand Prix Louisville](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gplou16) this weekend (and [Grand Prix Kyoto](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpkyo16)) for some Team Sealed, and these tournaments, more than any other, reward the best teams. Watch for excited pros (who love team formats, almost as a rule) to be talking about it all weekend.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. Mono-Blue Prison

In the area of "decks that are about to completely rotate," this one is by far my favorite. The Mono-Blue Prison deck of the modern Standard era isn't Prison like we used to think of it, where players were locked out of playing spells. Instead, it's a deck that makes it so most of your opponent's spells don't even matter.


First of all, it's creatureless. The only win conditions are [Rise from the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Tides) and [Part the Waterveil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Part+the+Waterveil). That makes the removal that is so prevalent in Standard today utterly pointless. [Grasp of Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Darkness)? Grasp of who cares. [Fiery Impulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Impulse)? More like, unusable impulse. [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish)? That can languish in your hand all game. [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command)? Well, um, shoot. That one can actually be problematic.


You see, the deck is, at its core, a [Jace's Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Sanctum)/[Engulf the Shore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore) deck. Engulf makes the deck possible, but [Jace's Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Sanctum) is the reason it works at all. The cost reduction makes your late game able to churn through cards, the scrying makes that churning go even faster, and multiples make cards like [Part the Waterveil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Part+the+Waterveil) easy to cast while still doing other things.


There are, admittedly, some odd-looking cards in the deck. [Prism Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prism+Ring) is no one's idea of a powerful card, but in a deck that casts a lot of spells of the same color but doesn't really kill creatures, it provides a powerful buffer between you and death.


Not killing creatures in current Standard seems like a significant problem, but it's really not with this deck, which takes a softer touch with any animals coming your direction. [Engulf the Shore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore)s sends them safely back to your opponent's hand, while [Day's Undoing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day%27s+Undoing) throws them I know not where, but somewhere between the library and hand. Of course, when that happens, you might have drawn yet another [Engulf the Shore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore)s (since they all get shuffled back in), which costs a whole lot less mana than your opponent's four three drops that were swept away.


After that, [Take Inventory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Take+Inventory), [Anticipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anticipate), and [Nagging Thoughts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nagging+Thoughts) keep the cards flowing. [Hydrolash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydrolash) is especially neat in that it acts as a Fog-like effect and a way to draw more cards. [Orbs of Warding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orbs+of+Warding) makes red burn decks look awfully silly, especially one [Thermo-Alchemist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermo-Alchemist).


The list below is Frank Karsten's, which I would consider pretty close to sacrosanct. So sleeve it up and cackle with glee as you overwhelm your opponents with blue spells.
