 Mike Cannon started writing From the Lab at the end of 2012 after two years with GatheringMagic. He is an ardent casual player and loves finding uses for bad cards. 







Everything you feared is about to come true. For sixteen years, one card has haunted the dreams of players around the world. When it enters the battlefield, it induces sheer terror in the hearts of your opponents. With *Vintage Masters* soon to be released on **Magic Online**, the nightmare is returning. Of course, you always knew it would.

[Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) has been a key part of several tournament-winning decks in its time. The most famous of these used [Survival of the Fittest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest) to search for creatures, discarding them to search for other creatures. Then [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) sacrificed and returned various creatures over and over again. [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal) killed creatures, [Uktabi Orangutan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Orangutan) destroyed artifacts, and [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) and [Spike Weaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Weaver) helped keep you alive.


### Yosei, Can You See?


Although [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) can definitely generate a lot of value, I want to do a lot more than that. Therefore, I turned to [Yosei, the Morning Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yosei%2C+the+Morning+Star). This dragon has a reputation for being reanimated to lock down opponents, and [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) is one of the best ways to do it.


So long as you have a creature on the battlefield, you can sacrifice it to return [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar) to the battlefield, then sacrifice [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar) to bring back anything else. With six mana, you can do this every turn to keep your opponent from even untapping. If you have two copies of [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar) in the graveyard you can do it with just three mana per turn, sacrificing one to bring back the other.


You'll need to end the game eventually, so I've included a rather appropriate win condition. [Kokusho, the Evening Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star) will drain 5 life from your opponent each time you sacrifice him, ending the game in four turns. You can even swap him back and forth with [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar) every turn to continue the lock at the same time.

[Karmic Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic+Guide) can also make the combo work with three mana per turn. Simply bring back [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar) with [Karmic Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic+Guide), and after the Guide dies to echo during your upkeep, sacrifice [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar) to [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) to bring it back. [Karmic Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic+Guide)'s ability will trigger and get back [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar), putting you right back where you started.


[Enlightened Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor) and [Idyllic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Idyllic+Tutor) ensure that you can get [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare), and [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) and [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) put the creatures you need in your graveyard. There's still one piece missing, however. You'll need a creature you can cast to get started with [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare). I wanted something that could help you out until you get the lock going, so I included [Banisher Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banisher+Priest) and [Fiend Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter). Although the creature you exiled will come back when you sacrifice the guy to [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare), you can simply lock it down with [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar) after that. I've also included [Shriekmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw), which you can cast or reanimate if there's a creature you need to stay dead.

### A Whale of a Tale


Another creature that combines quite nicely with [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) is [Great Whale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Whale). If you have three lands and two copies in the graveyard, you can swap them back and forth indefinitely. A fourth land will let you produce an arbitrarily large amount of mana as well. With six lands you can do it with only one Whale and any other creature, and seven lands gives you infinite mana with that. Although it gets far fewer style points, [Palinchron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palinchron) can substitute for [Great Whale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Whale), since it has the same ability.

This time, the smaller creatures needed to start off [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) will serve as the win condition as well. [Blood Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist) can drain your opponent of all his or her life, whether being switched back and forth with the Whale or simply watching from the battlefield. The other card I'll use is [Bloodrite Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrite+Invoker). You'll need the extra land to make infinite mana, but once you do, you can cast or return [Bloodrite Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrite+Invoker) to win the game. Even if your opponent has a removal spell, you can activate the Invoker seven times in response to end the game before it even leaves the stack.


[Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) can get you the cards you need while dumping the rest in the graveyard, useful for getting those Whales ready to reanimate. [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) is a more direct route to the same goal, putting two Whales and an Invoker in the graveyard to make sure the combo can get rolling right away. Meanwhile, [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) can buy you time by killing troublesome creatures or Planeswalkers.

Perplex is an absolute all-star here. Not only can it counter spells, but it can search for most of the key cards in the deck. [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare), [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive), [Bloodrite Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrite+Invoker), and even [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) are all possible targets for transmute, giving you whichever piece of the combo you're missing.

### Fightmare


It's time to battle it out and see which of these nightmares is the most terrifying. In the duel of dreams, there can only be one victor. Will dreams of [Great Whale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Whale)s induce an Ahab-esque madness, or will the stars align for [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar)? Let's go down to the arena and find out.


**Game 1**


Nightmare Whale started off with [Temple of Deceit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Deceit), and Starry Nightmare cast an [Enlightened Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor) on turn one. Both sides played land for a turn, then Nightmare Whale cast Buried Alice on turn three to get two [Great Whale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Whale)s and a [Blood Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist). Starry Nightmare cast a [Banisher Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banisher+Priest) and passed the turn.


Nightmare Whale cast [Bloodrite Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrite+Invoker) and ended the turn. Starry Nightmare used [Fiend Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter) to exile the Invoker, then attacked for 2 with [Banisher Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banisher+Priest). Nightmare Whale passed the turn with no play. Starry Nightmare used [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) to get [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar), Kokusho, and [Karmic Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic+Guide). During the end step, Nightmare Whale cast [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) on [Fiend Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter), getting back the Invoker.


Nightmare Whale passed the turn with no play, and Starry Nightmare cast [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare), sacrificing [Banisher Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banisher+Priest) to bring back [Karmic Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic+Guide), which returned [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar). An evoked [Shriekmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw) killed [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar), triggering its ability and locking down Nightmare Whale for a turn. The Whale couldn't do anything on its turn, and Starry Nightmare cast a [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar) before ending the turn.


Nightmare Whale got to untap once before the lock was complete, but that was enough. A fourth land entered the battlefield, and [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) sacrificed [Bloodrite Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrite+Invoker) to bring back [Great Whale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Whale), untapping the lands. [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) traded Whale for Whale until the untapping land made a few million mana, then sacrificed a Whale to bring back [Bloodrite Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrite+Invoker) and win the game.



![Bloodrite Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bloodrite+Invoker)

**Game 2**


Each side led with a land, and Starry Nightmare card [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) for [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar) on turn two, followed by [Enlightened Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor) for [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare). Nightmare Whale played a land and passed the turn, and Starry Nightmare cast [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive), getting Kokusho, [Karmic Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic+Guide), and [Fiend Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter).


Nightmare Whale cast [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy), getting [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) and putting a [Palinchron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palinchron) into the graveyard. Starry Nightmare cast [Fiend Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter) and ended the turn. Nightmare Whale cast [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive), getting [Great Whale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Whale), [Blood Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist), and [Bloodrite Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrite+Invoker).


Starry Nightmare cast [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare), sacrificing [Fiend Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter) to bring back [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar). Nightmare Whale cast [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), getting [Blood Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist), but Starry Nightmare used [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) to sacrifice [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar) and get [Karmic Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic+Guide), which brought back [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar), cementing the lock. Nightmare Whale conceded.



![Karmic Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Karmic+Guide)

**Game 3**


Both sides simply played lands until Nightmare Whale transmuted Perplex to find [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) on turn three. Starry Nightmare cast a [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) to get [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar), Kokusho, and [Karmic Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic+Guide), and Nightmare Whale used its own to get two [Great Whale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Whale)s and a [Bloodrite Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrite+Invoker).


Starry Nightmare played a land, then cast [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) and ended the turn. Nightmare Whale cast [Blood Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist) and passed back. Starry Nightmare cast [Shriekmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw). There were no nonblack creatures to destroy, but [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) used the creature to bring back [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar). Unfortunately, Nightmare Whale got there first, casting its own [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) and sacrificing [Blood Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist) to get [Great Whale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Whale). The Whales traded places a million times, and [Bloodrite Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrite+Invoker) finished things off once again.

### Uncovering Secrets


The nightmare is over for now, but there's something even more sinister on its way. For some time now, a conspiracy has been brewing at REDACTED. I've been trying to pin down who's involved, but so far I've only identified one member: REDACTED. I can only hope my editor, REDACTED, isn't REDACTED. If you get this message, I need someone to go to REDACTED and look for a REDACTED. Everything I have on the REDACTED will be there. Once you have it, deliver it to my contact at REDACTED right away. He'll be waiting for you at REDACTED. Godspeed.
