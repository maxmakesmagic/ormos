 What is arguably the greatest perk of becoming a member of the Pro Tour Hall of Fame? For a competitor like Frank Karsten, it's the eligibility to compete in every Pro Tour. In recent years, Karsten's love of the game has seen him join the coverage team and travel across Europe to cover its Grand Prix tournaments, as well as writing regular online articles filled with analytic insight into the format du jour. Three Pro Tour Top 8s , with double the Grand Prix Top 8s, is a fearsome accomplishment that speaks for itself.



But winning a Pro Tour is an accomplishment even the hallowed of the Hall of Fame still seek.


Matt Sperling isn't a Hall of Famer â€“ at least not yet if he has anything to say about it. With a team Grand Prix win almost two years ago in San Jose, Sperling has remained qualified for the Pro Tour through his status as a Silver level pro. Finding success this weekend would ignite an otherwise cool season that saw his Top 8 chances at Grand Prix Albuquerque lose narrowly on tiebreakers after giving friend, San Jose teammate, and fellow pro Paul Reitzl a guaranteed place.





*Hall of Famer Frank Karsten was guaranteed his Pro Tour qualification. Matt Sperling, who needed to maintain his Silver-level status if he wished to keep playing, was not.*
