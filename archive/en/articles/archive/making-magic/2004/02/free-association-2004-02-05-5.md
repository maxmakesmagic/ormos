![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi02/a862.jpg)There are many cool stories I could tell about Brian Kibler, but I think my favorites happened at last year's **Magic** Invitational. Brian was gunslinging after the tournament with a [wacky](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/mr110.asp) (at the time, anyway) deck he built to abuse [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) and [Mirari's Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake). Using the [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) and Wishes, Brian managed to make so many tokens that he maxed out ***Magic** Online's* ability to make tokens. 


Brian asked his opponent not to quit so he could watch the damage pile up. When Brian left that evening, the damage had not yet finished being registered.
