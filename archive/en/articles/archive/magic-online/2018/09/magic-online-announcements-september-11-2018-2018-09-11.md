Counters Are Getting a Revamp
-----------------------------



Do you run a deck that uses counters? If so, we have a treat for you! We're updating the look of the current counter system, so you can more easily identify what counters are being used. Egg counters, Despair counters, Pain counters, you name it, it is getting a visual update. To learn more about it and see what the counters will look like, check out [this article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/counter-development-2018-09-05) by our client developer Christopher Bellach.
