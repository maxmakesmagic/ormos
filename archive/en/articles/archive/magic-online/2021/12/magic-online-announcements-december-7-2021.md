Congratulations Yuuki Ichikawa & Toru Saito!
--------------------------------------------


Two players who qualified for last weekend's Innistrad Championship via *Magic Online* earned Top 6 finishes—enough to earn seats at World Championship XXVIII next year!


Yuuki Ichikawa reached the Innistrad event by defeating MTGO's best across multiple events—winning the 2021 Season 1 Champions Showcase in June. Yuuki made the most of his invitation and won the Innistrad Championship—a total of $40,000 in winnings across the two tournaments!


Meanwhile, Ichikawa's teammate Toru Saito parlayed a top finish in a MTGO Limited Super Qualifier in October into a fourth-place finish at the Innistrad Championship, earning $9,000 for his efforts and the World Championship invitation.


Congratulations to both players! If you aim for the heights of *Magic*'s top tournaments, learn more via the Quick Links at the top of this blog.

*Vintage Masters* Flashback Draft League Starts Wednesday
---------------------------------------------------------


Unfortunately, the Super Jump event mentioned in the *Magic Online* *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* release article in November has been postponed due to an unforeseen issue. We will be fixing this issue and debuting Super Jump during *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* season next year! Stay tuned for this awesome mix of *Jumpstart* and *Legacy Cube*!


So, for this week, we are running a Flashback League (Phantom) with *Vintage Masters.* The entry options for this League are 10 Event Tickets or 100 Play Points, and the event runs from Wednesday at 10 a.m. PT until downtime on December 15. Due to an issue with [Misthollow Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misthollow+Griffin), we've temporarily removed it from the *Vintage Masters* collation while this event is active.




---

Modern Banned Gauntlet Ends Tomorrow
------------------------------------


From December 1–8, players can choose a preconstructed Modern deck with a card we've banned in it and see how these "too good for Modern" decks fare against each other. Make sure to check out all the decklists in [the accompanying article here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/modern-banned-gauntlet-2021-11-30).

MTGO Convention Series – All Access Returns December 8
------------------------------------------------------


Want to join in on the fun of PAX, Gen Con, or Origins while playing from home? Want to try out almost all the cards available on *Magic Online* for up to a week at a time? Just like last year, MTGO is running a special series of tournaments hosted by the team at Pastimes Events.


Starting tomorrow, December 8, at 10 a.m. Pacific (18:00 UTC), purchase a PAX Unplugged entry package at [pastimesevents.com/mtgo-convention-series-championship](https://pastimesevents.com/mtgo-convention-series-championship/) for $20 and receive a code for redeeming inside *Magic Online*.

* A **Mythic Event Token** usable for entry into one of the 22 Constructed events held during the four days of the convention.
* **All Access** to cards in *Magic Online* until Wednesday at 10 a.m. Pacific following the convention—build a deck and enter games without having the cards in your collection!
	+ *All Access excludes* Battlebond*,* Secret Lair*, and old-frame Power Nine.*
	+ Enter any number of casual games at no cost.
	+ Leagues, queues, and scheduled events still require paying an entry option to join.

Play three rounds in a Convention Event and earn up to nine booster packs plus a pair of Convention Series-exclusive promos—a **Xanathar** avatar and a non-foil **Demilich**.


*NOTE: Each event has a cap of 56 players, and unused Mythic Event Tokens will be removed from accounts once All Access for that convention ends.*
