Threatened with the threat of Phyrexia's invasion of Dominaria, the artificer-turned-planeswalker Urza undertook his most ambitious endeavor: the construction of the Legacy. The Legacy, a collection of powerful artifacts and beings, together proved an incredibly potent weapon against the dark lord Yawgmoth.


*Tenth Edition's* printing of [Legacy Weapon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legacy+Weapon), featuring new art by Terese Nielsen, shows over a dozen of the Legacy artifacts right in the art box. How many can you recognize? (Beware, a couple of them are sneaky!) Watch Magic Arcana in the near future for the answers.

In the meantime, be sure to plan on heading to [**Magic** Game Day](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday&dcmp=ILC-MTGARCANA) this Saturday! It's a great opportunity to try to rip a black-bordered Legacy Weapon!
