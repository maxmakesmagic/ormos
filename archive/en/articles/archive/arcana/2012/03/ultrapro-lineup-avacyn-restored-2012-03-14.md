Would you like to see some new [UltraPro](http://www.ultrapro.com/index.php?cpath=33_58_75) products with *Avacyn Restored* art? If you wouldn't, then quick! Shut your eyes! Because they're right in front of you *right now*!

Looking good! But maybe a little hard to appreciate at that scale. Let's blow the sleeves up a bit so everyone can get a good look.
