"Hehe, I'm so smart" Ant, '05


Well, if skills at **Magic: The Gathering** have any bearing on actual intelligence, it seems that Antonino De Rosa is the smartest guy in the room, as he is the sole undefeated player at the end of Day One sitting on sweet record of 6-0-1. After playing a UrzaTron deck to 2-0-1 in Constructed, he blitzed his first draft 4-0 on pod 3, and now we'll see if he can repeat this feat on pod 1 and almost lock up his first Top 8 at U.S. Nationals. 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/usnat05/draft2_krempelsderosa.jpg)*De Rosa wanted to cut blue in the first pack.*De Rosa's picks in all caps, other key cards shown.


**Pack 1**


1st pick: KABUTO MOTH, [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter), [Moss Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moss+Kami), [Mystic Restraints](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Restraints), [Gibbering Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gibbering+Kami), [Kami of the Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+the+Hunt)  
 2nd pick: SORATAMI SAVANT, Sakura Tribe-Elder, [Honden of Cleansing Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honden+of+Cleansing+Fire), [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba), Kami of the Fires [Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar)  
 3rd pick: RECIPROCATE, [Orochi Sustainer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orochi+Sustainer), Order of the Taco Bell, One Hundred Talon Kami  
 4th pick: RIVER KAJIN, [Devouring Greed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Greed), [Eye of Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Nowhere)  
 5th pick: SORATAMI SEER, Sakura Tribe-Elder, [Masako the Humorless](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masako+the+Humorless), [Hisoka's Defiance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hisoka%27s+Defiance)  
 6th pick: DEVOTED RETAINER, [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami)  
 7th pick: BLESSED BREATH, Honden of Nights Reach, [Hisoka's Defiance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hisoka%27s+Defiance)  
 8th pick: [Eye of Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Nowhere)  
 9th pick: [Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists)


Then some late Thoughbinds and some off-colour cards completed pack 1, and he was nicely set into drafting a solid blue-white deck. When I asked him if he had a favour toward white over black due to passing [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter) (which is not wrong by any means, I was just curious), he explained how he and his fellow teammates who were at the table had agreed to show each other their decks so he felt the power of the Laughter was lost when your opponents knew you have it. He took the [Soratami Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soratami+Seer) so highly because he wanted to cut blue heavily in pack 1 and reap the benefits in pack 2, although he doesn't think that the card is too hot.


**Pack 2**


1st pick: JETTING GLASSKITE, [Split-Tail Miko](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Split-Tail+Miko), [Mistblade Shinobi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistblade+Shinobi), [Phantom Wings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wings)  
 2nd pick: [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku), Patron of the Crescent Moon  
 3rd pick: NINJA OF THE DEEP HOURS, [Callow Jushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Callow+Jushi), [Moonlit Strider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonlit+Strider), [Terashi's Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terashi%27s+Verdict)  
 4th pick: HUNDRED TALON STRIKE, [Floodbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Floodbringer)  
 5th pick: MOONLIT STRIDER, [Silverstorm Samurai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverstorm+Samurai)  
 6th pick: MOONLIT STRIDER, [Silverstorm Samurai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverstorm+Samurai)  
 7th pick: BLINDING POWDER, [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami), [Mending Hands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mending+Hands)  
 8th pick: MINAMO SIGHTBENDER, [Toils of Night and Day](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toils+of+Night+and+Day), Quaillmane Baku  
 9th pick: MENDING HANDS


Two [Heart of Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Light)s were in the last few cards he received, which can be very important in the blue-white deck as he has no answer to troublesome cards such as Matsu Tribe-Sniper and [Frostwielder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostwielder). These may well be two of the best cards in his deck at the right moment. It was interesting to see how Ant laid out his deck during construction, as he puts Ninja of the Deep hours in his spells column and not with the rest of all the monsters. 


**Pack 3**


1st pick: MOONWING MOTH, [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami), Barrel-Down Sokenzan, [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar)  
 2nd pick: KITSUNE LOREWEAVER, [Araba Mothrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Araba+Mothrider), [Spiraling Embers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiraling+Embers)  
 3rd pick: TORI WATCHWARD, Nikko Onna, Barrel-Down Sokenzan, [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar)  
 4th pick: MOONBOW ILLUSIONIST, Nikko Onna, [Ghost-Lit Nourisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Nourisher)  
 5th pick: TORII WATCHWARD, Shinen of Star's Light  
 6th pick: TORII WATCHWARD, Kaho Minamo Historian  
 7th pick: SORATAMI CLOUD CHARIOT, [Cowed by Wisdom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cowed+by+Wisdom)  
 8th pick: OBORO BREEZECALLER, [Cowed by Wisdom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cowed+by+Wisdom)  
 9th pick: SKULL COLLECTOR, [Descendant of Soramaro](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descendant+of+Soramaro)


Then just some very late [Araba Mothrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Araba+Mothrider)s came round and made it into the deck, which looked like this.

When I asked him what his hopes were for the deck, he said that he would be happy with 1-2, but that is just Ant as he never has any confidence in his own playing ability. I personally feel that this is a 2-1 / 3-0 depending mainly on his opponents' decks and how many problem cards they have. 


By the time I had gotten this far into the article, he has already dispensed with Craig Krempels in the feature match area so 1-2 is now a dead cert. He does have a very hard pod to contend with, but I have some confidence that we will see him coming back Sunday for the Top 8 possibly with some other members of his team …. THE SEVEN KINGS.
