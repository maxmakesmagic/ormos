Xu Liang is no stranger to the featured match area, having placed in the Top 8 of China Nationals last year. After losing to a mirror match, he has been paired against Deng Jun who is armed with the controllish [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combo deck. This matchup promises to be exciting, since both decks are able to come back from nowhere to suddenly reduce opponents from twenty to zero.


### Game 1


Xu won the die roll and led with an unexciting Mountain. Deng had an equally boring Island to go with his turn one [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). [Overgrown Battlement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) hit play on turn two with a freshly played Forest but Deng was quick to "remove" the Forest with [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas). A second copy of the defender ensured that Xu would have no problems with green mana and Deng could only dig deeper with a second [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), holding mana up for [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak).

Double [Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) on Xu's next turn brought him up to a total of a potential of at least eleven mana on his next turn. Deng was not about to let him ramp to astronomical numbers and decided to send one of the [Overgrown Battlement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement)s [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil).


When Xu tried to resolve [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), Deng shocked him with [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) untapping his own Island, before he [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed the Titan. Xu heaved a sigh of relief when Deng tapped not four, but three mana for [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), a tell-tale sign that he had not drawn any [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin)s yet. Xu seemed pretty much out of gas as he played his last relevant card in his hand. Unfortunately for Deng, it was a [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith), fetching [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan). A second copy of [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) tapped down the Titan for a turn but it was unable to stop multiple Valakuts from dealing lethal damage.

### Game 2


Both players had to mulligan and Xu was on the receiving end of double [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) on his first two green sources. Fortunately, he was able to resolve an [Overgrown Battlement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) in between and proceeded to cast [Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) on his third turn.


[Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) jumped out at the end of Deng's forth turn and threatened to connect the dots but he did not have the namesake enchantment once again. Instead, he was holding on to twin [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel)s, [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) as well as a [Mutagenic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth), a new tech utilized all weekend to combat the uncounterable [Combust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust).

When Xu passed his 6th turn with no play, it prompted Deng to ask, "You've got nothing as well?". Xu could only join him in a quick bout of hearty laughter.


A manually-drawn Valakut was able to keep [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) at bay, thanks for a fulfilled [Khalni Heart Expedition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Heart+Expedition). After drawing more than half his library, Deng finally tried to attach [Splinter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin to a [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), but that was promptly thwarted by [Combust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust). Two successive [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)s met successive [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze)s and the game went into a standstill.


[Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) revealed [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) from Xu's hand, decent insurance against a second copy of [Splinter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin. More protection came along the way as he drew into with a second [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) and [Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast) Within. Comfortable to play the waiting game, Xu bided his time until he finally drew [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith). He tutored out [Avenger of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar), creating 17 tokens to end the game in swift fashion.
