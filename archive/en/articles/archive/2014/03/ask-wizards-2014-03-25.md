|  **Q: How often does Friday Nights come out? How often does Walking the Planes come out? —Alessandro**  |  |  |

| Personally, I feel the answer is, "Not often enough." But that's not helpful (or official!), so here's an answer you can work with: We're looking to standardize the schedule for both, as they are currently a bit irregular, but that said...
In general, Friday Nights comes out about once a month.* Friday Nights archive on DailyMTG
* Ask Wizards question answered by Graham

Walking the Planes comes out two weeks after each event that Nathan Holt and Shawn Kornhauser attend. They go to all Pro Tours, Worlds Week, and a handful of Grand Prix each year.* Nate and Shawn archive on DailyMTG
* Ask Wizards question answered by Nate
* LRR's Hero's Path videos from Friday Nights

I hope that helps! |
