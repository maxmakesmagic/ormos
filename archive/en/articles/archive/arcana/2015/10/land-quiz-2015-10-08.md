Lands. Almost all decks can't function without them. They've been around since the beginning of *Magic*. There have been some powerful lands in *Magic*'s history (and some . . . less powerful ones). How well do you know your lands?


Take a shot at the quiz below—answers are after the art below.


1. What was the first creature land—that is, a land that could become a creature?
2. What is the nickname for the lands from *Ravnica* block that are two land types and come into play tapped unless you pay 2 life?
3. In what set did the enemy-color pain lands found in *Magic Origins* (lands that tap for one colorless mana, or can tap for a mana from one of two colors and deal 1 damage to their controller) first get printed?
4. What basic land has been printed the greatest number of times?
5. What basic land has been printed the second-greatest number times?
6. How many differently named basic lands are there?
7. What ability did the cycle of uncommon lands from *Legends* grant legendary creatures?
8. How many lands have the ability "T: Add 2 colorless mana to your mana pool"?
9. How many lands can add one and a half mana to your mana pool?
10. What is the most recently printed land that doesn't have the ability to generate mana?

1. [Mishra's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory).
2. Shock lands.
3. *Apocalypse*.
4. Mountain. It was printed in *Arabian Nights* by accident; it was never taken off the sheet when it was decided *Arabian Nights* wouldn't have a printing of the basic lands.
5. Island. It was printed as a rare in *Alpha*.
6. Ten. You'd think it would be five, right? But there are the five you know—Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, Forest—plus their Snow-Covered counterparts.
7. Five lands, one for each color, granted legendary creatures of that color the ability "Bands with other legends" ([Cathedral of Serra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathedral+of+Serra), [Seafarer's Quay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seafarer%27s+Quay), [Unholy Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy+Citadel), [Mountain Stronghold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain+Stronghold), and [Adventurers' Guildhouse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adventurers%27+Guildhouse)).
8. Two: [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) and [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors). Although we would also accept answers of three, four, five, six, seven and eight depending on how you count [Temple of the False God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+the+False+God), [Untaidake, the Cloud Keeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Untaidake%2C+the+Cloud+Keeper), [Shrine of the Forsaken Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+the+Forsaken+Gods), [Crystal Vein](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystal+Vein) and [Urza’s Power Plant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%E2%80%99s+Power+Plant) and [Urza’s Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%E2%80%99s+Mine).
9. Just one—[City of Ass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Ass) from *Unhinged*.
10. [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds). (*Editor's note: This originally said*[Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths). *That was incorrect.*)
