rk post graduated from Northern Illinois University with a BFA in the fall of 1994 after several years of going full and part time supporting a family. Just prior to graduation, he started freelancing the fantasy gaming industry doing interior illustration gradually teaching himself how to paint. His first paying job was for TSR (**Dungeons & Dragons**) doing interior illustrations for an **AD&D** module entitled Red Steel.

The RPG giant was purchased by Wizards of the Coast (**Magic: The Gathering**) within a year and he trekked Trina and the three boys out to the Seattle area. WotC and rk have parted company since the winter of 2000 and now works as a freelance illustrator and full time 3D Artist for Gas Powered Games (<http://www.gaspowered.com/index.php>) in Kirkland, WA.
