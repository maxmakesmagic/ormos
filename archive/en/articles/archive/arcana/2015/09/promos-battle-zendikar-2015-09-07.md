Everyone loves promo cards. Be they full art, shiny, alternate versions, or date stamped, there's just something cool about having the promo version of a favorite card. And today's cool somethings are the *Battle for Zendikar* promos that will be available to you soon.


**Gift Box**


We announced the Gift Box about a month ago, but we held back on the promo included in the box until a later time. Now is that time! I present to you the newest creature in a line of aggressive landfall one-drops, Scythe Leopard!

**Buy-a-Box**


It's time to seek out a Ruinous Path in Standard, and you can do so with this Buy-a-Box promo. Stores will be able to provide a small number of this promo, and the distribution is up to stores—so if you want to take creatures or planeswalkers down a ruinous path, ask your local store how you can get your hands on this premium removal spell.

**Release**


If you play in any Release Events October 2–4, including Friday Night *Magic*—and on top of any other promos you might receive—you might just find yourself herding some Eldrazi Scions with Blight Herder.
