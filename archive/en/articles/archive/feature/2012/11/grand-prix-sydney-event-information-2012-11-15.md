![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/promo/grandprix_2013.jpg)*Get your promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).*Sydney is a world-famous city sporting a modern wonder, the Sydney Opera House, a beautiful bridge spanning a breathtaking harbor and of course famous beaches including Manly and the iconic Bondi. And that's just the stuff you read about in the tour guides! The Grand Prix takes place in the heart of it all, in the beautiful Darling Harbour—a huge entertainment precinct that includes many great diversions such as the Sydney Aquarium, Wildlife World, IMAX Theatre not to mention a plethora of cafes, bars and restaurants. Our venue is Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre, which overlooks the water of Darling Harbour.


 While January is the winter across the northern hemisphere, it's summer in Sydney which adds that special something to the event. Darling Harbor is a backdrop for a fireworks display every Saturday night in January. While the northern hemisphere is under blizzard conditions and freezing, you can be enjoying three full days of **Magic** wearing shorts and a t-shirt! 


 Grand Prix Sydney is the last chance to test your *Return to Ravnica* Sealed Deck and Booster Draft skills. With a $30,000 purse and four Pro Tour invites up for grabs, you can be sure that competition will be fierce and with the best judges around keeping everything in order. Plus the first 300 players receive an awesome playmat! 


Running right alongside the Grand Prix is a huge side events schedule including massive Legacy and Vintage tournaments. Throw in a $1,000 event on Sunday plus on-demand drafts and Commander, and there really is something for everyone!


 Grand Prix Sydney is hosted by Top Deck Events. Visit the [Top Deck Events website](http://www.topdeckevents.com/) for updates and more details about the weekend's activities.
