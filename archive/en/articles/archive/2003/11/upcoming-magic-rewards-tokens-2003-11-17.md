Like rewards for playing tournament **Magic**? Coming to a [Magic Player Rewards](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=dci/rewards.asp) program near you: new creature token cards. The next upcoming batch of tokens available through the program will be an Angel token (for use with *Scourge's*  [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice)) and a Pentavite token (for use with *Mirrodin's*  [Pentavus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus)). Check out the art for both of these upcoming token cards.


See also this [previous Magic Arcana](/en/articles/archive/new-look-tokens-2003-09-24) to see how these creature tokens look in the new card frame.
