As BDM, Marshall, Ben Stark and the US crew get ready to bring you live video coverage of Grand Prix Omaha, their Japanese counterparts are already hard at work here in Shizuoka. The show is hosted by fifteen-year coverage veteran Keita Mori, alongside the irrepressible Mayako Kakuuchi and Japan’s Pro Magic Elder Statesman, Tsuyoshi Fujita. With a rotating cast of commentators they put up a weekend-long cavalcade of Feature Matches, player interviews and general tomfoolery for an appreciative audience. Just how appreciative they are is immediately apparent thanks to real-time incorporation of viewer comments into the broadcast. Particularly comic or devastating moments are accompanied by a deluge that can completely eclipse the action.
