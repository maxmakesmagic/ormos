**The Players**


Yuuki Hirabayshi and his teammates at "Chagam Fireball" have become a regular sight at Japanese Grand Prix. What began as a highly informal gaming group from Nagano has become a legitimate team, almost despite its members' best efforts.


Of course, when you put up a 10-1 record, you start running into Bosses. Facing down Tzu Ching Kuo of Team MTG Mint Card (whose roster includes Shi-Tian Lee and Shouta Yasooka) is a far cry from busting your buddies' heads in a pick-up draft.

Both are 2-0 and looking to complete the sweep of Draft 1.


**The Decks**


Unsurprisingly both decks are powerhouses. Kuo is with a 16-land Red-White heroic deck, and Hirabayashi has a Black-White Control deck. He took his cues from Hall of Famer Frank Karsten, studying his power rankings for *Born of the Gods* / *Theros* draft. Opening [Herald of Torment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Torment) put him in black, and the table cooperated, giving him the lion's share. His deck seems like a perfect foil for Kuo's, packed with removal and strong defensive creatures.


**The Games**


Game one started out in Kuo's favor as he rolled out [Akroan Skyguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Skyguard) into [Elite Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Skirmisher). [Scholar of Athreos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scholar+of+Athreos) hit play for Hirabashi to snarl the ground. Kuo gave his Skyguard a [Dragon Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle) and started to pour his red mana into it when Hirabayashi showed that he was stuck on just three plains.

It was only a momentary lapse. His deck served up a swamp and he passed the turn with all his mana up, a sure sign of [Divine Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict). Kuo refused to bite, holding his Skyguard back. However, he was drawing a lot of land and couldn't really build an alternate offense. When the following turn yielded nothing he decided to cash in [Spark Jolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spark+Jolt) for a counter on his Skyguard, and Hirabayashi responded with [Pharika's Cure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure) to completely shut him down. From there Hirabayshi added [Keepsake Gorgon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keepsake+Gorgon) and as more mana came off his deck his Scholar was able to lock up the game.


**Hirabayashi 1 - Kuo 0**


When you draw up a gameplan for your aggro deck, rarely does it read "Do nothing until you cast a fourth-turn [Bronze Sable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Sable)". Kuo stared across the table at two [Returned Phalanx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Phalanx)es that left him no room to maneuver. Hirabayshi had no mana troubles this game, and rattled off [Pharika's Cure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure) for a tardy [Akroan Skyguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Skyguard), and [Asphyxiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asphyxiate) for [Akroan Conscriptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Conscriptor).

Hirabayashi played it slow and cautious, and Kuo was never able to develop a fighting board. [Scholar of Athreos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scholar+of+Athreos) soon showed up and brought inevitability with him. Hirabayashi's teammates quietly pumped their fists as he drained away the last of Kuo's life.
