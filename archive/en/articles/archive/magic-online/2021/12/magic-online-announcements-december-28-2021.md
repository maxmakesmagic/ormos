2021 Season 3 Showcase Qualifiers
---------------------------------


Players who earned entry into the Showcase Qualifier will be squaring off for an invitation to the 2021 Season 3 Champions Showcase!


The entry fee for Showcase Qualifiers is a format token that matches the format of the Showcase. As with QPs, after the season's Showcase Qualifiers are finished, all unused Format Tokens will be removed from players' accounts.


Each Showcase Qualifier is a scheduled Swiss-style event with a Top 8 playoff. The winner of each Showcase Qualifier earns a spot in the final Showcase event and a chance to earn their share of $70,000 and an upcoming Premier Event invitation.


Showcase Qualifiers are scheduled as follows:





| DATE | TIME | FORMAT | INVITATION |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sunday, January 2, 2021 | 6:00 a.m. | Pioneer | MOCS Showcase & Neon Dynasty Championship |
