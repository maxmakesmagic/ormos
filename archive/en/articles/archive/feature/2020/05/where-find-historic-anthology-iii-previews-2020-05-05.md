Historic, *Magic: The Gathering Arena*'s nonrotating format, is quickly approaching its third release, bringing with it even more cards from *Magic*'s past to unlock new and interesting strategies.


To celebrate, we're revealing every card in Historic Anthology III on May 8 at outlets around the internet. We've already given you a sneak peek at two cards included in Historic last week on Weekly MTG. Take a look:
