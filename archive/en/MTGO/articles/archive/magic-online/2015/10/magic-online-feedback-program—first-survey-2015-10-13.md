Last week I announced the beginning of a [new feedback program](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/introducing-magic-online-feedback-program-2015-10-05) that uses surveys to give you the chance to have a voice in the future of *Magic Online*. I’m excited to kick off the program with this survey about the *Battle for Zendikar* Prerelease Events on *Magic Online*.

Prerelease Events are, in my opinion, one of the most fun things about *Magic Online*. They represent the first experience many people have with a new set, and first impressions are critical! The *Magic Online* team is always looking for ways that we can [improve our events and offerings](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/september-2015-event-changes-2015-09-28), and since the Prerelease occupies such an important role, we thought it would be a good place to start the feedback program.


After the introductory questions, what we are really hoping to learn with this survey is what aspects of Prerelease Events you most enjoy, and which need improving. We have a few ideas of how we could make some small modifications to our Prerelease Events to create an even better experience for you, but we want to hear your thoughts first!


We expect this survey to take about 5 to 10 minutes.
