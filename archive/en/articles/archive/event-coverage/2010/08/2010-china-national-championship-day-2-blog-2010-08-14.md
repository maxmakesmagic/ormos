由于明早还有两轮的轮抽竞赛，今日不能透露有关Pod2的任何资料。明天将带给您更多精彩的战情！2010年国家冠军将在明天出炉，就让我们拭目以待吧！


After 7 rounds of intense competition, Mai Jun Wei (pictured left) remains the only undefeated player with the much coveted untarnished 7-0 record, edging out Meng Fan Xuan (pictured right) in the last round of the day. Six players, each with eighteen points, tail closely behind, whilst reigning Worlds Team Champion 2009 members Zhang Zhiyang and Wu Tong remain in contention at fifteen points each.

星期一, 10.15 a.m. - 第9轮: 雷强 对战 庞禹
-------------------------------


*Chapman "randomchap" Sim*

**Game 1**  
**第一局**


Pang Yu won the die roll and elected to play, but was forced to swap his hand for a fresh six. He didn't seem happy about it and could only muster [Silvercoat Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion) and double [Goldenglow Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldenglow+Moth) within the first four turns. Lei Qiang had a vastly superior opening though, starting with [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) on turn 1, [Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl) on turn 2, [Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief) on turn 3 and Aether Adept on turn 4. He followed up that brutal draw with [Quag Sickness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness) and [Stabbing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stabbing+Pain), killing the lion and one of the two annoying moths. Pang Yu started to land flood and could only watch as Lei Qiang attack turn after turn with his team, drawing four extra cards off [Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief) over the next four turns, finishing the game in speedy order.


庞禹掷骰子赢了，选择先开始，不过被迫调度。可惜，手牌还是不太好，前四回合只有一只银毛狮[[Silvercoat Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion)]与两只澄闪蛾[[Goldenglow Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldenglow+Moth)]。雷强似乎占了上风，以注定[[Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)],卜算猫头鹰[[Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl)],卷轴盗贼[[Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief)]和乙太专家[[Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept)]华丽开场。过后，又使用沼地病症[[Quag Sickness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness)]和刺痛[[Stabbing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stabbing+Pain)]干掉狮子和澄闪蛾之一。庞禹继续爆地，一只没有抓到任何生物。卷轴盗贼[[Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief)]接二连三为雷强抓了四张牌，通常若有这种现象应该会稳操胜券。


Lei Qiang wins Game 1.  

雷强第一局获胜。


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/chnat10/FM9%20Lei%20Qiang.jpg)*Lei Qiang (雷强）*
**Game 2**  
**第二局**


Pang Yu summoned a [Child of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) on turn two, then enhancing it on turn three with [Holy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Holy+Strength). However, Lei Qiang had [Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl) on turn two, scrying into an [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) to deal with the 3/3 lifelinking monstrosity. Pang Yu returned [Child of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) to his hand, but opted to play his [Cloud Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader) on turn four instead. He also dropped [Stormfront Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus) next turn, boosting his air force significantly, but both fliers traded with Lei Qiang's [Quag Sickness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness) and [Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl).


The board was empty and both players were out of gas, laying only lands for the next three turns while passing with no plays. Such attrition wars causing stalemales seem pretty common in the world of M11. Playing off the top of their decks, Lei Qiang was the first to draw some business spells. In succession, he summoned [Azure Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake) and [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), resurrecting [Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl). All that scrying netted Lei Qiang the "very-ridiculous-in-M11-draft" [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) and [Corrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt), which took his opponent down from twenty to zero in one swift turn.


庞禹第二回合亮出暗夜之子[[Child of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night)]，雷强则召唤卜算猫头鹰[[Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl)]。不洁之力[[Holy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Holy+Strength)]成功让吸血鬼进攻，不幸被乙太专家[[Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept)]制服。下回合云际十字军[[Cloud Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader)]和暴锋飞马[[Stormfront Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus)]加入庞宇的阵容，不过都与雷强的沼地病症[[Quag Sickness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness)]和猫头鹰一对一交换。不过，下几回合一片寂静，除了下地以外，两人都没有使用任何咒语。雷强比较幸运些，顺序掏到碧蓝龙兽[[Azure Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake)],掘墓怪[[Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger)]和M11最暴力的炸弹，墓地泰坦[[Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan)]。下回合的攻击加上腐化[[Corrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt)],一口去把对手的20个生命化为乌有。


**Lei Qiang wins Game 2 and takes the match!**  
**雷强第九轮获胜！**

星期一, 11.40 a.m. - 北京一游
----------------------


*Chapman "randomchap" Sim*

I am an ardent believer (and follower) of the saying that while we "Play the Game", we should also be "Seeing the World". Take a glimpse of what we have experienced so far, and be sure to attend the next Grand Prix held in China if you want your share of good food and great culture.


在工作之于，我们也没忘了到处走马看花，体验一下中国历史悠久的文化古迹，和色香味俱全的美食。和你们分享我们到处遨游的一些新的吧！


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/chnat10/PhotoEssay7-Airport.jpg)**Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA)**  

A great country like China needs to have an impressionable facade. The capital of the world's most populated country welcomes you warmly with a grand airport like this one. Currently the 2nd busiest airport in the world (outranked by only the Atlanta International Airport), it was also named the "World's Best Airport" in 2009


**北京首都国际机场**  

一下飞机就有那么漂亮的机场迎接我们，让我们对中国的第一印象加分。目前列为全世界载客量第二高的机场（只少于亚特兰大国际机场），它在去年也被公认是2009最好的机场。.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/chnat10/PhotoEssay9-Breakfast.jpg)**A hearty local breakfast**  

I received quite a pleasant surprise when I had breakfast for the first time in China. For only 3 Yuan (USD$0.45), I got 5 scrumptious pork buns and a warm bowl of soya milk, and a comfortable air-conditioned environment to enjoy it all.


**早点**  

第一次在中国吃早餐得到一个意外的惊喜。在一间舒适，备有冷气的餐馆点了五个肉包子和一碗豆浆，居然只要3元。真是顿丰富的早餐！


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/chnat10/PhotoEssay6-Great%20Wall.jpg)**Great Wall of China**  

Still the only man-made structure that can be seen from the moon, this majestic fortification has been the icon of China as long as anyone could remember. Some of the judges had the fortune to witness its magnificence first-hand and were not disappointed with the breathtaking views.


**万里长城**  

从月球唯一能看到的人造建筑就只有万里长城。如此壮观的雄伟建筑，自古以来就成了中国的标志。几位外国裁判亲身莅临，景观简直叹为观止。


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/chnat10/PhotoEssay4-TianAnMen.jpg)**Tian An Men Square**  

Widely considered the most important site in the history of modern China, it happens to also be the largest city square in the world. UNESCO World Heritage Site, The Forbidden City, also lies nearby, making it a much heralded area to visit for international tourists and locals alike.


**天安门广场**  

位于在世界遗产紫禁城附近的天安门，是全球最大的广场，有重大的历史意义，外国游客都慕名而来。


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/chnat10/PhotoEssay1-Peking%20Duck.jpg)**"Quanjude" Peking Duck**  

My dad once told me not to leave Beijing without trying Quanjude. Peking Duck is one of the most famous Chinese delicacies in the world and for good reason. Quanjude (established in 1864) happens to be the most historied brand of China, selling more than 2 million of such roasted ducks annually. At only 158 Yuan (USD$23), you could take one home for yourself.


**全聚德北京烤鸭**  

我爸说过，到了北京千万不要忘了吃全聚德。成立于1864年，他们一年销售超过两百万只烤鸭，真不简单。每只只卖158元，错过可惜！


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/chnat10/PhotoEssay8-Venue.jpg)**Tournament Venue**  

The tournament officials were meticulous when it came to choosing a venue for the convenience and comfort of the players. There is no better setting than a luxurious ballroom at Holiday Inn Beijing for China's most important **Magic** event.


**竞赛场地**  

孩之宝选择场地时绝不能马虎。今年就在豪华的丽都假日饭店举行国冠赛，作为全国最大的年度盛事的地点，提供给大家一个舒适的环境专心比赛。


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/chnat10/PhotoEssay5-Little%20Sheep.jpg)**"Little Sheep" Steamboat Restaurant**  

The locals frequent steamboat restaurants in search of delectable delights and "Little Sheep" is one of the favorites. Boiling thinly sliced mutton in broth may not sound appetitizing but it really is. Li Chao (a local judge and PTO) made sure he brought us here for an unmissable treat and the judges from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore were lucky they came along. In fact, they are so famous they even have expanded to Japan.


**小肥羊**  

热情的李超（一级裁判与PTO）费尽唇舌也要带我们来光顾这知名的羊肉涮火锅店。此餐馆果然不负众望，让来自台湾，香港和新加坡的裁判都吃的不亦乐乎。听说小肥羊在日本还有分行喔！


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/chnat10/PhotoEssay3-Dong%20Po.jpg)**Dongpo Meat**  

This Chinese dish is named after its creator Su Dongpo, one of China's most celebrated poets from the Song Dynasty. It is essentially a piece of sinful pork belly, but you'd need to be crazy to resist taking a bite after looking at this photograph. At 15 Yuan (USD$2.20) per portion, it happens to be very affordable as well.


**东坡肉**  

相传为北宋诗人苏东坡所创制，东坡肉可是个家喻户晓的美食。一块肥肉十足的五花肉配上梅菜，简直是人间美味。明知道脂肪成分高，可是又爱不释"口"，真是纳闷。一碟只需15元，物超所值！


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/chnat10/PhotoEssay2-Factory%20Outlets.jpg)**Shopping in Beijing**  

What's a vacation without a little shopping? We chanced upon a mall packed with more brand names than we can remember, selling off-season apparel at a fraction of its usual price. The only regret was not having more time (or money) to indulge in such retail therapy.


购物  

来北京度假，多多少少也要买买东西。毕竟，一定会比外国便宜一些。我们来到一栋装满换季优惠店的购物广场，开始大开杀戒。唯一美中不足的是时间（和金钱）不够多！

星期一, 12:30 p.m. - 环境分析
----------------------


*Chapman "randomchap" Sim*

Ever since the introduction of M11, new decks have been born and classics have received makeovers with newly added tech. Along with M10, the presence of both Core sets being legal in Standard (an unprecedented occurrence) creates rather interesting interactions.


Perhaps the most shocking of all is the popularity of Blue White Control, with 25 players choosing hide to behind [Wall of Omens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens) and a grip of countermagic. Due to [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)'s entrance into the format, control players now have the ability to use [Essence Scatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter) and [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) alongside it to greater effect. It has been a few blue moons ago that any archetype has exceeded the number of Jund decks in any Standard tournament.



![Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mana+Leak)

 

Jund remains popular as before with 24 players, even if there aren't many too changes to its maindeck. M11 has provided new gear for Jund pilots, seeing how [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) and [Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth) have partnered with the usual suspects [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) and [Sprouting Thrinax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax) to create a new "monsterpiece".


Naya also makes a resurgence thanks to [Fauna Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman), enabling a toolbox strategy while providing a card advantage engine, all rolled up into one fantastic package for a mere two mana. 17 players have been pitching [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine)s to assemble the deadly combo of [Cunning Sparkmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage) and [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) (searching for [Basilisk Collar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk+Collar) of course) all day, while tutoring up their singleton [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel) or Realm Razor.

Howling Mine

Temple Bell

Blue Red seemed to be the rage the entire day though, with 9 of them (including multiple Nationals Team players) running [Runeflare Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap) decks and 5 with [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). Once again, this is largely attributed to the fact that both M10 and M11 are coexisting in Standard, enhancing combo strategies that were not as consistent as before. M11 provides [Temple Bell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Bell) (receiving the baton from [Font of Mythos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Font+of+Mythos)) to speed up the deck considerably, pairing up with M10's [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) to ensure opponents always have more cards than they can ever play.


[Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) has also benefited from both Core sets being in the same format. M11's [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) alongside M10's [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) considerably increases the chance to draw this namesake enchantment. I know for a fact that not drawing any of them is lethal, because I learnt it the hard way myself.

自从M11踏入标准环境以后，许多新的套牌纷纷萌芽，旧的套牌也各个加入新的科技。M10和M11在标准环境共存（一件前所未有的事情）带给大家许多的生机。


最令人吃惊的也许是蓝白控受欢迎的程度，居然比屹立不倒的勇得还要多，共有25件代表作。这种现象近几个月的比赛几乎未发生过。想必是因为魔力流失[[Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)]的关系，连同菁华离散 [[Essence Scatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter)]和失效 [[Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)]等等反击咒语，使得蓝白控套牌加强不少。



![Fauna Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fauna+Shaman)

 

勇得以往常一样，依然十分受欢迎，一共有24副。套牌基本上没有很大的变化。墓地泰坦 [[Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan)]和顽强巴洛西 [[Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth)]都上阵，连同血辫地精 [[Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf)]和芽生叉齿蜥 [[Sprouting Thrinax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax)]一块儿展开肆虐。


纳雅也在一瞬间成了顽强的竞争者，应该和动物群祭师 [[Fauna Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman)]离不开关系。只需2点魔法力，她可将一张张的复仇藤蔓 [[Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine)]，转换成狡诈火花法师 [[Cunning Sparkmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage)]或锻石秘教徒 [[Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic)]（搜出蜥怪颈环 [[Basilisk Collar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk+Collar)]），将这具有杀伤力的"康宝"组合起来。同时，又能把仅有一张的破邪天使 [[Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel)]和夷壤 [Realm Razor]找出，一点儿也不赖！共有17位玩家选择了这副套牌。

红蓝似乎也非常受欢迎，一共有9副红蓝陷阱套牌，和5副焰侯腾扬套牌。这两种套牌实力大增的原因，多半和M10于M11同处在标准环境内有关。加上M11的庙宇响钟 [[Temple Bell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Bell)]并除掉神赐洗礼盘 [[Font of Mythos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Font+of+Mythos)]使得陷阱套牌加速不少，连同M10的嚎叫的矿井 [[Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine)]确保对手的手牌"滔滔不绝"。


至于焰侯腾扬套牌，M11的注定 [[Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)]和M10的沉思 [[Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)]可让玩家比较顺利搜到不可或缺的结界，没有两张共存在标准真的没法玩。M11的回忆升起 [[Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind)]和M10的时间弯曲 [[Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp)]可让玩家的到无限量的免费回合，几个月后在标准就无法再实行。


真好奇中国国家冠军将会是使用哪副套牌呢？


  


星期一, 1:00 p.m. - 第11轮: 徐亮 对战 余季荪
--------------------------------


*Chapman "randomchap" Sim*

**Game 1**  
**第一局**


Xu Liang had to mulligan but it did not hamper his explosive start. A first turn [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) enabled [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) to hit play on turn two. [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), cascading into [Cunning Sparkmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage), hit play on turn three, together dealt 5 damage this turn.


The 8/8 Knight threatened to end the game next turn and Yu Ji Sun probably realised that as well. Controlling only five land with no way to deal with the fattie, he promptly conceded after drawing his forth card of the game.


徐亮虽然调度了，但没影响爆发力。第一回合的贵族大主教 [[Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch)]允许圣物骑士 [[Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary)]在第二回合进场。第三回合血辫地精 [[Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf)]进场，倾曳到狡诈火花法师 [[Cunning Sparkmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage)]。目前，坟场内共有六张地牌，圣物骑士 [[Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary)]有8/8那么大。 余季荪算了算自己的地牌，第四回合就认输。

**Game 2**  
**第二局**


The second game was equally speedy. Oddly, the player who mulliganed seemed to have the nuts draw for this match. Yi Ji Sun opened with a turn two [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), into a turn three [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) and [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate). A forth turn [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) tutoring for two [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) hit play, with Yi Ji Sun laying his third [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle). Not having a [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), Xu Liang was smart enough to deduce what would happen next turn and promptly scooped up his cards.


这次改换余季荪调度，展开了另一场血腥的对局。他第二回合探索大地 [[Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore)]，第三回合再次探索和栽培[[Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate)]。在第四回合中施放出劲爆的太古泰坦 [[Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)]，搜出两张熔天顶瓦拉库[[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle)]，自己从手中掏出第三张瓦拉库，迅速拿下第二盘。


**Xu Ji Sun wins Game 2!**  
**余季荪第二句获胜！**

**Round Three**  
**第三局**


Xu Liang opened with a [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) and [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), but both were toasted to a crisp by a [Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt). This slowed down his draw significantly, so he tried to tangle up his opponent's mana with an [Ajani Vengeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant). Not having bombs with power out with his abundance of mana, Yi Ji Sun could only watch as the counters of [Ajani Vengeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant) reach 8. The ultimate ability didn't matter anyway, since Xu Liang had dropped a Realm Razor to secure his victory.


徐亮的魔法力生物贵族大主教 [[Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch)]与天堂鸟 [[Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise)]快速被分叉雷击 [[Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt)]，不过在第四回合结算了复仇阿耶尼 [[Ajani Vengeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant)]。余季荪地牌虽然够多，但没什么炸弹可施放，眼巴巴看着阿耶尼的忠诚度上升到8。当夷壤[Realm Razor]在下回合进场的时候，胜负已分，余季荪只好再度认输。

Monday, 2:05 p.m. - Round Twelve: Zhang Zhiyang VS Meng Fan Xuan
----------------------------------------------------------------


*Chapman "randomchap" Sim*

I had to pick an epic win-and-in match in the last round of Swiss and I'm pretty sure I made the correct choice. Easily the most exciting match I have witnessed today, it also promises to be lengthy and full of huge stacks of spells and triggered abilities. Proceed at your own risk!


Both players at 8-3 records saw themselves paired against each other with no chance to draw in the final swiss round of the tournament. Zhang Zhiyang won the die roll with a whooping 20 and elected to begin first. Piloting one of the nine [Runeflare Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap) decks in the field today, he found himself in the position to make Top 8 once again. Incidentally, his opponent Meng Fan Xuan happened to be playing a deck of a similar color combination, but choosing to duplicate spells with [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) instead. As both players are running decks with combo elements and permission spells, this promises to be an arduous battle of wits.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/chnat10/FM12%20Zhang%20Zhiyang.jpg)*Zhang Zhiyang*
**Round One**


Zhang Zhiyang opened with [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) and [Temple Bell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Bell) on turns two and three, only to have the latter countered by [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Meng Fan Xuan dug for his [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) by Seeing Beyond and passed the turn after making his third land drop. A 4th turn [Font of Mythos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Font+of+Mythos) entered play for Zhang Zhiyang.


All the card drawing artifacts had ironically helped his opponent draw the enchantment he needed. Meng Fan Xuan looked at his grip of 9 cards and decided to drop the "Replicate-granting" enchantment and discarding [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) rather than casting it, apparently to hold mana back for countermagic.


Zhang Zhiyang found himself in trouble, now that his opponent had drawn the most important card in his deck. Aside from [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil), he did not seem to have a way to deal with it. He studied Meng Fan Xuan's graveyard intently before deciding on casting a [Temple Bell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Bell). Meng Fan Xuan flashed him a second [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), putting the first counter on [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension).


Untapping, he cast a [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) triggering [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) once again. Zhang Zhiyang tried to send the enchantment [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) and surprisingly, Meng Fan Xuan did not try to oppose. There was no need to. With so many cards flowing in and out of his hand, he had no problem recasting the Ascension and fulfilling it again. He discarded [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) and [See Beyond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond) and passed the turn.


Meng Fan Xuan tried once again to [See Beyond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond) next turn, but Zhang responded with his second [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). Meng Fan Xuan tried to cast the Ascension again and Zhang Zhiyang let it resolve. Currently holding a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), one [Runeflare Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap), all he needed was a [Twincast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twincast) or another Trap to kill his opponent instantly. There was no use to exhaust his countermagic.


The action started after Meng Fan Xuan had drawn for his turn, because Zhang Zhiyang decided to go for the kill and create possibly the biggest stack this game. A [Runeflare Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap) ran into [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), which prompted Zhang Zhiyang to [Twincast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twincast) the [Runeflare Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap). Meng Fanxuan let the [Twincast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twincast) resolve, taking a huge zap, going down to [Lava Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Axe) range. Zhang Zhiyang then tried to resolve the original [Runeflare Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap) by paying 3 mana to fulfil [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)'s payment, leaving him with only one [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). His opponent simply responded with a second [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). and Zhang simply flung at [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to the dome, bringing Meng Fan Xuan down to just two life. Although his Pyromancer's Ascension had come online, he was on the brink of impending death.


Convinced that Zhang Zhiyang was out of gas, Meng Fan Xuan picked up both artifacts and made sure he was announcing his spell during the correct step. During Zhang Zhiyang's upkeep, Meng Fan Xuan tapped out for a copied [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) on both Zhang Zhiyang's artifacts ([Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) and font of Mythos), trying to prevent him from drawing more cards. The copy targeting [Font of Mythos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Font+of+Mythos) was countered and Zhang Zhiyang proceeded to draw three cards, including his draw step. That net him a time Warp, which he immediately cast without a second thought. On his free turn, he drew the [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) required to win the game, ending the half-hour long epic battle.


**Zhang Zhiyang wins Game 1.**


**Round Two**


Meng Fan Xuang swiftly resolved [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) and [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) on turns two and three respectively, while Zhang Zhiyang once again had his faithful [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) on turn two. Both players were wary not to tap out and discarded cards on both of their next turns.


Drawing a second [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine), Zhang Zhiyang tried to resolve it, only to meet [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) from Meng Fan Xuan. [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), now at 9 counters threatened to take twenty cards from Zhang Zhiyang's and he tried to send it home using [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) from Meng Fan Xuan ensured that Jace would reach 11 counters next turn. In a matchup where player are typically drawing 5 cards a turn, decking your opponent with [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren)'s ultimate seemed like a very solid plan. All Meng Fan Xuan had to do was defend his Planeswalker (and himself) so he simply passed with no play and proceeded to discard, but Zhang Zhiyang stopped him.


He tried a [Runeflare Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap) at the end of Meng Fan Xuan's turn, which he revealed a [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) to nullify. Zhang Zhiyang then cast [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) on [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), which met Meng Fan Xuan's [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Zhang Zhiyang proceeded to tap out for a [Twincast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twincast), targeting [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and Meng Fan Xuan ensured nothing resolved by also tapping out for a [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate).


Zhang Zhiyang's secret agenda to tap Meng Fan Xuan out had successfully been executed, for he had two [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp)s in his hand waiting to resolve. [Time Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) number one allowed him mana to cast another [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) and bounce the Ascension.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/chnat10/FM12%20Meng%20Fan%20Xuan.jpg)*Meng Fan Xuan*
On his third consecutive turn, he asked him opponent how many cards he had, presumptably trying to go for the kill again. Using [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) to kill his opponent's copy, he had managed to temporary evade library death but could not finish off his tapped out opponent. He could only shake his head in despair and pass the turn.


Meng Fan Xuan untapped and recast the Ascension, having no other play. Two [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s were flung at Zhang Zhiyang during his end of turn, putting the first counter on the enchantment. [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) tried to recollect [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), but Zhang Zhiyang responded with [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), which was promptly paid for. Zhang Zhiyang tried [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) again, which was again paid for, tapping Meng Fan Xuan for another turn.


A third time Warp had appeared for Zhang Zhiyang, so he dropped his [Temple Bell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Bell), [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) and then [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp). On his next turn, he dropped another [Temple Bell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Bell) and passed the turn, still unable to win immediately despite all the cards he was drawing.


Meng Fan Xuan untapped in relief and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed twice in a row, putting the second counter on [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). Zhang Zhiyang was in real trouble now, since he would need to counter each of his opponent's spells twice, burn and countermagic included. Meng tried to [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) but Zhang [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce)d the copy. Meng Fan Xuan, having only two mana left, declined to pay. Zhang Zhiyang then responded with a [Runeflare Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap), hoping to bait his opponent to tap out, since he was holding onto [Ricochet Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap) in his hand to misdirection the [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) on the stack. Zhang was out of options and was forced to play his last trump card and Meng responded with a copied [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) on the [Ricochet Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap).


At this juncture, there was a hiccup as Meng Fan Xuan forgot to discard before moving on to his free turn. The judge's verdict was for him to discard RANDOMLY down to the intended amount. He tried to cast Pyromancer's Ascension, which Zhang [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze)d. Meng simply cast his second [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) and did a double [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) and proceeded to take both his extra turns.


On his 3rd consecutive turn, he cast another [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp), bringing himself up to three extra turns in-lieu. On his 4th turn, drew another three cards and copied a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), trying to find just one more burn spell. He eventually fulfilled the second Ascension to ensure his burn spells would be copied threefold. Time was called and Meng Fan Xuan had control of 4 of the remaining five turns, with Zhang Zhiyang was tapped out.


At this juncture, he asked a judge if it was ok to play with his hand revealed and the response was positive.


He revealed a grip full of multiple burn spells and countermagic, displaying that he had would win this match if he simply tapped two [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s to fling triple [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s and [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning)s at Zhang Zhiyang. However, there was no way that either of them could make the Top 8 cut if this game turned out to be a draw. Meng Fan Xuan thought it was a waste if that happened, and decided to graciously concede without a word, putting Zhang Zhiyang in the top 8 for the second year running, generating immense applause from the bystanding audience.


**Zhang Zhiyang wins 2-0 and advances to the Top 8!**
