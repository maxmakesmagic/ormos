 David works on the Magic community team as a content specialist. He spends his days writing about Magic Online and trying to play too many colors at once in Limited. 






The *Magic Online* *Eldritch Moon* Prerelease is this weekend, and maybe it's the biology-warping Eldrazi titan talking, but one Prerelease just isn't going to be enough! If you're torn between going all in on Zombies or are trying to find a way to meld more rat people in a given game, multiple Prereleases can ensure that no strategy is left unexplored. Prerelease from the comfort of your own home on *Magic Online* July 29–August 1 and get in more Prereleases than a Chittering Host has rats!

Never played in a Prerelease before? Gavin Verhey's [*Eldritch Moon* Prerelease Primer](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/eldritch-moon-prerelease-primer-2016-07-11) is a great place to learn about these awesome events. If you've already tried a Prerelease or two and want to experience them on *Magic Online* as well, read on!

LEARNING THE CLIENT
===================


Once you've coaxed *Magic Online* from the Blind Eternities, next up is familiarizing yourself with the client. In the below video, *Magic* streamer and commentator Gaby Spartz walks players through *Magic Online*, from signing up to finding games to play.

After your first few games on *Magic Online*, you might want to learn some of the hotkeys to speed up your matches and avoid mistakes. Check out the list below, and update any of them in-game by navigating from the *Magic Online* Home Scene -> Account -> Input Settings:

They all have their uses, but a few of my favorites are F2 to pass priority to your opponent, F4 to pass until you can respond, and F8, which toggles bluffing. When bluffing is deactivated with F8, *Magic Online* will pause for your response only in situations where you have something you can play, plus the mana to play it. For example, if you have three untapped islands and one Cancel in your hand, and your opponent has just cast a Fireball, you'll have a chance to respond. If you only have two Islands untapped, the Fireball will resolve without giving you a chance to respond since you don't have enough mana to cast your spell.


TYPES OF *MAGIC ONLINE* PRERELEASE EVENTS
=========================================


In-Store Prereleases come in the Sealed format, but there are a variety of additional ways to Prerelease on *Magic Online*.


If you enjoy the way Prereleases run at your local game store, you might want to try joining a Prerelease Sealed League. *Magic Online* Prerelease Leagues consist of five matches that you can play whenever you want, using a deck you build out of your six-booster Sealed pool. Play two matches and take a nap, then finish up the last three; it's on your schedule! Once you finish your five matches, you'll get your prizes—just make sure to finish your League games by August 3 at 7 a.m. PT, the last day of the League! Starting July 29 at 10 a.m. PT, you'll be able to join an *Eldritch Moon* Prerelease Sealed League by navigating from the Home Scene to the Play Lobby, then filtering to "Limited Tournaments" and "Leagues."

We'll also be running drafts all Prerelease Weekend long, running July 29 at 10 a.m. PT until August 1 at 10 a.m. Prerelease Drafts are Swiss structure, so no need to worry about being eliminated before getting a few matches in. Prerelease Drafts can be found by filtering to "Limited Tournaments" and "Queues" in the Play Lobby section of *Magic Online*.
