The month of November means something different for everyone. For some, it's a questionable excuse to not shave for an entire month. For others, it's a month with a lot more holiday time than your typical month in a year. And for many, it's a time to root for your country in this year's World *Magic* Cup.


The World *Magic* Cup is Coming!
================================


In about two weeks, representatives from 73 countries will get their game faces on in Rotterdam to compete in the 2016 World *Magic* Cup, one of *Magic*'s most electric premier play offerings. The tournament takes place November 18–20 and features multiple days of team play, starting with three rounds of *Kaladesh* Team Sealed before moving on to Team Unified Modern for the rest of the weekend, as teams of four from 73 countries compete to become World *Magic* Cup champions. $250,000 is also up for grabs for top finishing teams, with the winning team receiving $48,000 evenly split between the four teammates.


The World *Magic* Cup has a tradition of bringing out the most electric emotions from both competitors and fans. Here are a couple of highlights from the last few years:

The World *Magic* Cup meme that will live on forever. Fun fact, the cameraman for this shot is Shawn Kornhauser of *Walking the Planes* and *Enter the Battlefield* fame. This is one of the moments he is proudest to have captured on film, as the varied display of emotion across all the faces captured in this big moment—Team USA losing to a topdecked [Bonfire of the Damned](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonfire+of+the+Damned), and the advancement of eventual World *Magic* Cup winners Team Chinese Taipei—makes this a clip you can watch over and over and still find things you didn't notice from a prior viewing.


Funny enough, this particular clip took on a life of its own and has been turned into gifs and loops on a variety of channels (much to the chagrin of the Team USA competitors of that year, who get to live this moment again and again every time it's mentioned. I'm probably not helping with that either, so sorry!).

Another instant classic came from 2013, as the finals of that year came down to one match, one game, and one big draw step. Personally, this is one of my favorite clips to feature Rich Hagon in the commentator booth.


Timothée Simonot, the French competitor in that match, has also made the rounds in *Magic* news once again with his [Twisted Color Pie *Magic Online* Cube submission](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/you-make-cube-voting-2016-10-17).


Raphaël Lévy, the winning-team captain from 2013, will return this year as France's national champion.

The win, which put Denmark on the map and started two Danish players on their path deeper into the Pro Tour, came from a series of comeback plays—including the now famous "Daneblast"—in 2014's World *Magic* Cup.


We will see both Martin Müller and Simon Nielson, two of 2014's World *Magic* Cup–winning team members, representing Denmark again in 2016.

A fun moment from first-time Top 8 country Scotland last year was one of 2015's World *Magic* Cup highlights. Scotland knew they were playing for a chance at the Top 8, but only found out that they had made the cut once their match was completed. The reaction, as you see, involves team members Martin Clement and Stephen Murray tackling coverage floor reporter Tim Willoughby in excitement upon hearing that they were through.

And of course, it's hard to forget about Team Italy's win in 2015. This event was also the launch of Andrea Mengucci to the top of the standings, as only a few months later he earned his second Pro Tour Top 8 with a second-place finish at [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi).


Mengucci will return this year as Italy's team captain.
