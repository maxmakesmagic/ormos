**Ivan Floch:** I'll just have to destroy it and then kill the tokens. That's why the card is so annoying. There's no other way around it for my deck.

**Fabrizio Anteri:** With [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost), or just fight back with my own [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker).

**Thoralf Severin:** Well, I can counter it. And if it's small enough it doesn't harm you, and if it's big you can either destroy it and then sweep the board with a Wrath-effect. Or just chump it and ignore it.

*Andrea Mengucci*




**Andrea Mengucci:** I have [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) and [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost). The key is to resolve Anafenza and kill [Hangerback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangerback+Walker) on the same turn. You don't tap out for it on turn three but wait until you have extra mana for something like [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command).

*Michael Bonde*




**Michael Bonde:** It can be a problem if I attack into it. But once I can create a boardstall it can grow as big as it wants, because I am just going to attack in the air. If my opponent then can't kill it himself it's not going to do anything.
