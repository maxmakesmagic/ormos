Pro Players Club Guidelines and Procedures
==========================================


 








### Pro Players Club Guidelines and Procedures


*Effective October 14, 2013*


The following Pro Tour Players Club Guidelines and Procedures document identifies all applicable requirements and limitations for participation in the **Magic: The Gathering**® Pro Tour Players Club (the "Pro Players Club", or "Club"). By signing a Consent and Waiver Agreement, and receiving the Club benefits, you agree to adhere to all conditions and requirements for entry and participation in the Club. Any questions regarding Club membership or requirements may be submitted to Wizards at [archive.wizards.com/customerservice](http://wizards.custhelp.com/). Click on the "Email Us" tab, sign in, then select "WPN Players", then "PT Players Club".


The information contained below applies to the 2013-2014 Pro Tour Players Club only.


### Membership


**Joining the Pro Players Club**  



The 2013-2014 Professional Points season begins May 20, 2013 and ends August 3, 2014, and all tournaments included in that time period make up the season.


Professional Points are officially awarded on the final day of applicable tournaments after the final standings have been determined by Wizards. Only players who actually compete in the applicable tournaments will receive Professional Points for those tournaments. Tournaments, information about Professional Points Seasons, and the number of Professional Points awarded to players from those tournaments can be found in the [**Magic: The Gathering** Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://archive.wizards.com/wpn/document.aspx?x=magic_the_gathering_premier_event_invitation_policy).


**Eligibility**  



**Attaining Levels of Membership**  



The minimum number of Professional Points required in the 2013-2014 Professional Points Season for (1) immediate promotion to Pro Club levels and applicable benefits in the 2013-2014 Pro Club and (2) levels and benefits in the 2014-2015 Pro Tour Players Club are:



* Silver level: 20 Professional Points
* Gold Level: 35 Professional Points
* Platinum level: 45 Professional Points

The winner of each Pro Tour and World Championship is immediately advanced to Platinum level for the remainder of the current season and the entirety of the following season (as if that player had reached the minimum number of Professional Points at that Pro Tour or World Championship to be promoted to Platinum level).


**Losing Membership Status**
At the conclusion of the 2013-2014 Professional Points season, Pro Tour Players Club membership will expire for all members who did not earn at least 20 Professional Points during the season. Pro Tour Players Club membership will terminate for any member who becomes ineligible for DCI membership during a Professional Points season for any reason. Check the [**Magic: The Gathering** Tournament Rules](http://archive.wizards.com/wpn/document.aspx?x=magic_the_gathering_tournament_rules) for more information.


Pro Players Tour Club membership will be suspended for any member suspended by the DCI, until such time as his or her DCI Membership is reinstated. Members under DCI suspension are not eligible for Pro Tour Players Club benefits.


**Member responsibilities**  



All members will comply with all rules, regulations, and behavior standards applicable to the DCI and the Club, as may be modified from time to time in Wizards' discretion. Members understand and agree that all decisions of Wizards and/or its authorized designates (including tournament judges) are final.


Members are responsible for keeping their contact information current with the Wizards of the Coast (especially e-mail address). Contact information can be updated at [(http://membership.wizards.com)](https://membership.wizards.com/login.aspx?returnurl=http%3a%2f%2fjudge.wizards.com%2fhome.aspx) and log in using your DCI number and password.
