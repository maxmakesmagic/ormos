After hundreds of Day 2 matches, I always like to run the numbers.


Here is the average number of match points gained during the Swiss rounds of the Sunday competition by pilots of the top five most represented archetypes:


Mardu Midrange: 10.3  



Here, 9 points would represent an average 3-3 record, or even slightly better than that because people drawing and dropping might reduce the overall point total a little bit.



 What we learn from these numbers is that relative newcomer Mardu Midrange, which didn't do all that well at Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, had an impressive performance this weekend. Featuring heavy-hitters like [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde), and tweaked towards beating Jeskai Wins and Abzan Midrange, it has the right tools to compete in this Standard metagame. Be sure to check out Brad Nelson's decklist from the Top 8!



Next up, I have the matchup scores between these archetypes for you:




|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Abzan Midrange | Jeskai Wins | Abzan Aggro | Green Devotion | Mardu Midrange |
| **Abzan Midrange** | X | 35-19 (65%) | 16-9 (64%) | 10-6 (63%) | 4-9 (31%) |
| **Jeskai Wins** | 19-35 (35%) | X | 7-10 (41%) | 10-9 (53%) | 5-10 (33%) |
| **Abzan Aggro** | 9-16 (36%) | 10-7 (58%) | X | 2-4 (33%) | 3-3 (50%) |
| **Green Devotion** | 6-10 (38%) | 9-10 (47%) | 4-2 (67%) | X | 2-4 (33%) |
| **Mardu Midrange** | 9-4 (69%) | 10-5 (67%) | 3-3 (50%) | 4-2 (67%) | X |
