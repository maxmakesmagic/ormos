It's not everyday we have a Legacy event and we'd really love it if you could get a feel of the current Legacy metagame. Thanks to the hard work of the Japanese coverage team, we were able to put together the below information for your viewing pleasure!


Eldrazi was the most popular choice by far and most players seemed to think that [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer) and [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher) powered our by [Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin) and [Eldrazi Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple) were too good to pass up. In addition, the mana base also includes [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) and [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) which allows them to play [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void), which is probably the most disruptive card in their deck.


Miracles came in a close second and one in ten players opted to play with [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) and [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus). Heralded as one of the most powerful decks in the format, it was perceived as one of the decks to beat this weekend.


Shardless Sultai as well as Death and Taxes came in third and fourth most popular decks to nobody's surprise. Both pillars of the Legacy metagame, they have tools which can help them overcome even the Eldrazi and Miracles.

There are so many archetypes because Legacy is played with cards spanning over two decades. It can look daunting if you're new but I promise it is very interesting to learn about how some of these unique decks operate. If you're unsure about how certain archetypes work, ask your friends or go to a local game store where you're sure to find someone who will help you out!
