The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. Go to [Magic.Wizards.com/Rules](http://magic.wizards.com/rules) to find the most up-to-date rules.


The "General Notes" section includes information about card legality and explains some of the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" sections contain answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" sections include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

GENERAL NOTES
=============


Card Legality
-------------


*Innistrad: Crimson Vow* cards with the VOW set code are permitted in the Standard, Modern, and Pioneer formats, as well as in Commander and other formats. At release, the following card sets will be permitted in the Standard format: *Zendikar Rising*, *Kaldheim*, *Strixhaven: School of Mages*, *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms*, *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*, and *Innistrad: Crimson Vow*.


*Innistrad: Crimson Vow* Dracula cards with the VOW set code and numbered 329–345 and 403 feature a name other than their own on the title bar, with the normal name in a secondary title bar below it. For game play purposes, these cards have only the card name specified in the secondary title bar.


*Innistrad: Crimson Vow* Commander cards with the VOC set code and numbered 1–38 (and their alternate versions numbered 39–76) are permitted in the Commander, Vintage, and Legacy formats. Cards with the VOC set code numbered 77 and above are legal for play in any format where a card with the same name is permitted.


Go to [Magic.Wizards.com/Formats](https://magic.wizards.com/formats) for a complete list of formats and their permitted card sets and banned lists.


Go to [Magic.Wizards.com/Commander](https://magic.wizards.com/Commander) for more information on the Commander variant.

New Keyword Ability: Cleave
---------------------------


Cleave is a new keyword ability found on some instant and sorcery cards. You can pay a cleave cost to remove some of the words from a spell, making it more powerful.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Alchemist%27s+Retrieval)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alchemist%27s+Retrieval)
Alchemist's Retrieval  

{U}  

Instant  

Cleave {1}{U} *(You may cast this spell for its cleave cost. If you do, remove the words in square brackets.)*  

Return target nonland permanent [you control] to its owner's hand.


General cleave notes:


* If you cast a spell for its cleave cost, that spell doesn't have any of the text in square brackets while it's on the stack.
* A cleave cost is an alternative cost that's paid instead of the spell's mana cost. Casting a spell for its cleave cost doesn't change the spell's mana value.
* You can't cast a spell for both its cleave cost and another alternative cost. For example, if an effect gives an Alchemist's Retrieval in your graveyard a flashback cost of {U}, you can't cast it from your graveyard for its cleave cost.
* If an effect allows you to "cast a spell without paying its mana cost," you can't cast that spell for its cleave cost.



---

New Keyword Ability: Training
-----------------------------


People on Innistrad are constantly preparing to face the horrors of their world. For many, that means training themselves to be better in combat. Training is a new keyword ability that makes creatures stronger when they attack alongside creatures that have greater power than they do.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Apprentice+Sharpshooter)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Apprentice+Sharpshooter)
Apprentice Sharpshooter  

{2}{G}  

Creature — Human Archer  

1/4  

Reach  

Training *(Whenever this creature attacks with another creature with greater power, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.)*


General training notes:


* A creature's training ability triggers only when both that creature and a creature with greater power are declared as attackers. Increasing a creature's power after attackers are declared won't cause a training ability to trigger.
* Once a creature's training ability has triggered, destroying the other attacking creature or reducing its power won't stop the creature with training from getting a +1/+1 counter.



---

Set Theme: Blood tokens
-----------------------


What vampire wedding would be complete without blood? Several cards in this set create or make use of Blood artifact tokens.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gluttonous+Guest)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Guest)
Gluttonous Guest  

{2}{B}  

Creature — Vampire  

1/4  

When Gluttonous Guest enters the battlefield, create a Blood token. *(It's an artifact with "{o1}, {oT}, Discard a card, Sacrifice this artifact: Draw a card.")*  

Whenever you sacrifice a Blood token, you gain 1 life.


General Blood token notes:


* If an effect refers to a Blood token, it means any artifact token with the subtype Blood, even if it has gained other subtypes.
* You can't sacrifice a Blood token to pay multiple costs.
* Some triggered abilities trigger "whenever you sacrifice a Blood token." These abilities trigger regardless of why you sacrificed that Blood token.
* Some spells that instruct you to create a Blood token require targets. You can't cast these spells without choosing all required targets, and if all of those targets become illegal targets, the spell won't resolve and you won't create any Blood tokens. If some but not all of those targets become illegal, you'll do as much as possible, including creating Blood tokens.



---

Returning Mechanic: Disturb
---------------------------


Disturb has returned, but this time with a twist. Previously, all *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* cards with disturb were Spirit creatures on their back face. In this set, the back faces of cards with disturb are Auras that come back to enchant a permanent and imbue it with some ability.





![Distracting Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=540836&type=card)
![Clever Distraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=540837&type=card)

Turn Over


Distracting Geist  

{2}{W}  

Creature — Spirit  

2/1  

Whenever Distracting Geist attacks, tap target creature defending player controls.  

Disturb {4}{W} *(You may cast this card from your graveyard transformed for its disturb cost.)*  

////  

Clever Distraction  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

Enchanted creature has "Whenever this creature attacks, tap target creature defending player controls."  

If Clever Distraction would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.


* Disturb is found only on the front faces of some double-faced cards.
* "Disturb [cost]" means "You may cast this card transformed from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost."
* When you cast a spell using a card's disturb ability, the card is put onto the stack with its back face up. The resulting spell has all the characteristics of that face.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a disturb cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of a spell cast using disturb is determined by the mana cost on the front face of the card, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was. (This is a special rule that applies only to transforming double-faced cards, including ones with disturb.)
* A spell cast this way enters the battlefield with its back face up.
* If you copy a permanent spell cast this way (perhaps with a card like Lithoform Engine), the copy becomes a token that's a copy of the card's back face, even though it isn't itself a double-faced card. The mana value of the copy will be 0.
* The back face of each card with disturb has an ability that instructs its controller to exile if it would be put into a graveyard from anywhere. This includes going to the graveyard from the stack, so if the spell is countered after you cast it using the disturb ability (or in the case of an Aura, if its target is no longer legal), it will be put into exile.



---

Returning Mechanic: Transforming Double-Faced Cards
---------------------------------------------------


An encore of Innistrad couldn't be done without even more transforming monsters and creatures of the dark, and so transforming double-faced cards return again in this set. No rules changes to double-faced cards have occurred in this set.


A double-faced card has two faces: a front face and a back face. It doesn't have a *Magic* card back. A transforming double-faced card from this set has a sun symbol in the upper-left corner of its front face and a moon symbol in the upper-left corner of its back face. Other than distinguishing one face from another, these symbols have no effect on game play.


Unlike the modal double-faced cards found in some recent sets, the back faces of transforming double-faced cards don't have a mana cost and can't be cast (although the disturb ability in this set carves out an exception). They can, however, transform. To transform a card is to turn it from its front face to its back face, or vice versa.


Double-faced cards haven't changed since the last time we saw them in *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*. Here is some more info:


* Each face of a transforming double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, abilities, and so on. While a transforming double-faced permanent is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored.
* Transforming double-faced cards are cast face up unless they're being cast using the disturb ability. Consider only the characteristics of the face that's up; the other face's characteristics are ignored.
* While a transforming double-faced card isn't on the battlefield or on the stack, consider only the characteristics of its front face.
* The mana value of a transforming double-faced card is the mana value of its front face, no matter which face is up.
* The back face of a transforming double-faced card usually has a color indicator that defines its color.
* The back face of a transforming double-faced card can't be cast unless an effect allows you to cast it "transformed." (See the "Returning Mechanic: Disturb" section of this document.)
* A transforming double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed or you cast it transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.
* To transform a permanent, turn it over so that its other face is up. Only permanents represented by transforming double-faced cards can transform.
* If you are instructed to transform a permanent that isn't represented by a double-faced card, perhaps because it's a token or a single-faced card that has become a copy of a double-faced permanent, that instruction is ignored.
* Transforming a permanent doesn't affect any Auras or Equipment attached to that permanent. Similarly, any counters on the permanent will remain on that permanent after it transforms. Any continuous effects from a resolved spell or ability will continue to affect it. Any spells or abilities on the stack that target a permanent continue to do so after that permanent transforms.
* Damage marked on a double-faced permanent will stay marked on that permanent after it transforms.



---

Returning Mechanic: Daybound/Nightbound
---------------------------------------


It wouldn't be Innistrad if we didn't have Werewolves and magic that cares about the moon. While the Vampires take center stage in this set, there are still plenty of cards that care about whether it's day or night.


Nothing has changed about daybound/nightbound since the release of *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*. However, a full overview is provided below





![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=541048&type=card)
![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=541049&type=card)

Turn Over


Avabruck Caretaker  

{4}{G}{G}  

Creature — Human Werewolf  

4/4  

Hexproof  

At the beginning of combat on your turn, put two +1/+1 counters on another target creature you control.  

Daybound *(If a player casts no spells during their own turn, it becomes night next turn.)*  

////  

Hollowhenge Huntmaster  

Creature — Werewolf  

6/6  

Hexproof  

Other permanents you control have hexproof.  

At the beginning of combat on your turn, put two +1/+1 counters on each creature you control.  

Nightbound *(If a player casts at least two spells during their own turn, it becomes day next turn.)*


### **Day/Night Overview**


Day and night are designations that the game itself can have. The game starts as neither. Once the game becomes day (or less commonly, night), the game will be exactly one of them—day or night—going back and forth for the rest of the game. Double-faced cards with daybound and nightbound care a lot about this. As long as it's day, the face with daybound will be face up on the battlefield. As long as it's night, the face with nightbound will be face up on the battlefield.


### **Becoming Day or Night the First Time**


Double-faced cards with daybound and nightbound are *transforming double-face cards*. They can be cast only face up. In most cases, they'll first appear on the battlefield front face up. If it's neither day nor night, and a permanent with daybound appears on the battlefield, it becomes day. Other abilities can also cause it to become day or night, such as Brimstone Vandal's second ability.


**Going from Day to Night or Night to Day**


Once the game has a day or night designation, whether that designation changes each turn is generally determined by the number of spells the active player cast on the previous turn.


* Before a player untaps their permanents during the untap step, the game checks to see if the day/night designation should change.
* If it is day, and the active player of the previous turn cast no spells during their turn, it becomes night.
* If it is night, and the active player of the previous turn cast two or more spells during their turn, it becomes day.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, if it's day and no player on the previous turn's active team cast a spell during that turn, it becomes night.
* In a Two Headed Giant game, if it's night and any player on the previous turn's active team cast two or more spells during the previous turn, it becomes day.
* Double-faced permanents with daybound transform to their nightbound faces as it becomes night. Similarly, double-faced permanents with nightbound transform to their daybound faces as it becomes day. This happens immediately and is not a state-based action. It happens any time it becomes day or night, not just during the untap step.

### **Very Important Things to Remember at Night**


* If you cast a spell with daybound during night, that spell will be front face up (that is, daybound face up) on the stack. However, it will enter the battlefield with its back face up (that is, with its nightbound face up). It won't enter with its daybound face up and then transform.
* If it is night, permanents with daybound that enter the battlefield without being cast will enter with their nightbound faces up.

### **Putting the "Bound" in Daybound and Nightbound**


* Permanents with daybound and nightbound can't transform via any means other than their daybound and nightbound abilities. Notably, older cards such as Moonmist that instruct a player to transform permanents don't affect permanents with daybound or nightbound.
* Once it has become day or become night, the game will have exactly one of those designations until the game is over. It can never be both day and night at the same time. Once it is day or night, the game can't return to being neither.
* The whole game is day or the whole game is night. It won't ever be day for one player and night for another.

### **One of the Most Unusual Cases We Could Think Of, And Someone Would Ask**


* If it's neither day nor night, and a creature with daybound and a creature with nightbound somehow appear on the battlefield at the same time, it becomes day. The creature with nightbound will transform.



---

Dual Land Cycle, Part 2
-----------------------


*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* introduced a cycle of five nonbasic lands that enter the battlefield tapped unless you control two or more other lands, and *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* brings you the other five color combinations to complete this extended cycle.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Deathcap+Glade)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathcap+Glade)
Deathcap Glade  

Land  

Deathcap Glade enters the battlefield tapped unless you control two or more other lands.  

{T}: Add {B} or {G}.


* If one of these lands enters the battlefield at the same time as any number of other lands, those other lands are not counted when determining if this land enters the battlefield tapped or untapped.



---

Returning Keyword Ability: Exploit
----------------------------------


Exploit is a keyword ability that allows you to sacrifice another creature when the creature with exploit enters the battlefield. Creatures with exploit also have a second triggered ability that occurs when they "exploit a creature." This second ability is different on each creature with exploit.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Diver+Skaab)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diver+Skaab)
Diver Skaab  

{3}{U}{U}  

Creature — Zombie  

3/5  

Exploit *(When this creature enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice a creature.)*  

When Diver Skaab exploits a creature, target creature's owner puts it on the top or bottom of their library.


General exploit notes:


* A creature with exploit "exploits a creature" when the controller of the exploit ability sacrifices a creature as that ability resolves.
* You choose whether to sacrifice a creature and which creature to sacrifice as the exploit ability resolves.
* You can sacrifice the creature with exploit if it's still on the battlefield. This will cause its other ability to trigger.
* If the creature with exploit isn't on the battlefield as the exploit ability resolves, you won't get any bonus from the creature with exploit, even if you sacrifice a creature. Because the creature with exploit isn't on the battlefield, its other triggered ability won't trigger.
* You can't sacrifice more than one creature to any one exploit ability.



---

Returning Keyword Ability: Soulbond
-----------------------------------


*Innistrad: Crimson Vow* Commander decks bring back the soulbond mechanic, a mechanic that allows a creature to become "paired" with exactly one other creature, usually with benefits for both.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thundering+Mightmare)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundering+Mightmare)
Thundering Mightmare  

{4}{G}  

Creature — Horse Spirit  

3/3  

Soulbond *(You may pair this creature with another unpaired creature when either enters the battlefield. They remain paired for as long as you control both of them.)*  

As long as Thundering Mightmare is paired with another creature, each of those creatures has "Whenever an opponent casts a spell, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature."


General soulbond notes:


* Two paired creatures are still individual creatures in every way: they attack and block individually, they are targeted and affected by spells or abilities individually, and they change zones individually. If two paired creatures are attacking, blocking one of them has no effect on the other, for example.
* Neither soulbond ability targets any creature.
* You must control another unpaired creature at the moment a creature with soulbond enters the battlefield or the soulbond ability won't trigger at all. However, the creature that pairs with the creature with soulbond isn't chosen until the soulbond ability resolves.
* If the pair is broken, the bonuses and abilities granted to the creatures immediately disappear.
* A creature with soulbond may grant an ability to itself and the creature it's paired with that includes the text "this creature." In such abilities, "this creature" refers only to the creature that has that ability, not the creature it's paired with.
* If a creature with soulbond is paired with another creature with soulbond, each of them will receive both bonuses.
* If you control multiple unpaired creatures with soulbond and another creature enters the battlefield, each soulbond ability will trigger. Soulbond abilities that try to resolve after you pair the creature will have no effect.
* If a paired creature with soulbond loses soulbond, it and the creature it's paired with remain paired.

Take an extra turn after this one. During that turn, damage can't be prevented. [At the beginning of that turn's end step, you lose the game.]  

Exile Alchemist's Gambit.


* If multiple "extra turn" effects resolve in the same turn, the most recently created turn will be taken first.
* If you somehow skip the extra turn Alchemist's Gambit gives you or skip that turn's end step, the delayed triggered ability never triggers. (If you cast Alchemist's Gambit by paying its cleave cost, the delayed triggered ability is never created at all.)
* Exiling Alchemist's Gambit happens as part of its resolution. If the spell is countered, it will go to the graveyard as normal.

* Ancient Lumberknot's ability doesn't actually change any creature's power. It changes only the amount of combat damage the creature assigns. All other rules and effects that check power or toughness use the real values, even if they cause damage "equal to a creature's power" to be dealt.

* Ascendant Packleader's first ability considers only permanents already on the battlefield when determining if it should apply. If Ascendant Packleader is entering the battlefield at the same time as another permanent, the replacement effect won't see that permanent.

−7: Exile the top five cards of your library. You may cast red spells from among them this turn. You get an emblem with "Whenever you cast a red spell, this emblem deals X damage to any target, where X is the amount of mana spent to cast that spell."


* Chandra's first ability uses the stack and can be responded to, even if no targets were chosen. It doesn't count as a mana ability.
* Chandra's second ability checks the characteristics of the card you exiled to see if it's red. If the spell that card becomes somehow isn't red, you may still cast it. For example, Rowan, Scholar of Sparks, the front face of a modal double-faced card, is red. Will, Scholar of Frost, the back face of the same card, is blue. In exile, that card is red, so you may cast either face if you exile it with this ability.
* Chandra's last ability, by contrast, only allows you to cast spells that are red when you cast them, no matter what the card in exile is. If Rowan, Scholar of Sparks is exiled by this ability, you won't be able to cast Will, Scholar of Frost this way because it would be a blue spell.
* You must pay all costs for spells cast via Chandra's last two abilities. For the middle ability, you must also follow all timing restrictions.
* The emblem's triggered ability looks for the actual amount of mana spent to cast the spell. If an effect caused you to pay more or less mana for that spell as you cast it, that will be taken into account when determining the value of X. If an effect would counter that spell unless you pay some amount of mana, that mana doesn't count as mana spent to cast it.

Enchanted creature has "Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn."

Assuming that Nurturing Presence is still on the battlefield as that first triggered ability resolves, the Spirit will cause the ability the enchanted creature has to trigger and it will get +1/+1 until end of turn.

When Odric, Blood-Cursed enters the battlefield, create X Blood tokens, where X is the number of abilities from among flying, first strike, double strike, deathtouch, haste, hexproof, indestructible, lifelink, menace, reach, trample, and vigilance found among creatures you control. *(Count each ability only once.)*


* Odric, Blood-Cursed counts the number of the listed abilities found, not the number of creatures with those abilities. If you control a single creature with both reach and vigilance as Odric enters the battlefield, you create two Blood tokens. On the other hand, if you control two creatures that each have flying, you create a single Blood token.
* Variants of an ability are counted as that ability and are not counted multiple times. For example, if you control a creature with hexproof from blue and another creature with hexproof from black, you create a single Blood token.

Exploit *(When this creature enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice a creature.)*  

When Overcharged Amalgam exploits a creature, counter target spell, activated ability, or triggered ability.


* Activated abilities are written in the form "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as equip and crew, are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts.
* Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as prowess and fabricate, are triggered abilities and will have "when," "whenever," or "at" in their reminder text.
* If you counter a delayed triggered ability that triggers at the beginning of the "next" occurrence of a specified step or phase, that ability won't trigger again the following time that phase or step occurs.
* Overcharged Amalgam's exploit ability can't target mana abilities. An activated mana ability is one that could add mana to a player's mana pool as it resolves, doesn't have a target, and isn't a loyalty ability. A triggered mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool and triggers based on an activated mana ability.
* Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, can't be targeted. Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" are also replacement effects and can't be targeted.

* Parish-Blade Trainee's last ability puts all of its counters onto the target creature, not just its +1/+1 counters.
* Parish-Blade Trainee's last ability doesn't cause you to move counters from itself to the target creature. Rather, you put the same number of each kind of counter Parish-Blade Trainee had when it died onto that creature.
* In some unusual cases, you may end up putting the appropriate counters on more than one permanent. For example, if you control The Ozolith when Parish-Blade Trainee dies, you'll put the appropriate number of each kind of counter onto both The Ozolith and the target creature.
* If Parish-Blade Trainee has -1/-1 counters on it when it dies, the last ability will include those as well. This may result in the recipient also dying.

* If an activated ability of a card in exile references the card it's printed on by name, treat Patchwork Crawler's version of that ability as though it referenced Patchwork Crawler by name instead.
* If you control more than one Patchwork Crawler, each will have only the activated abilities of creature cards exiled with that specific Patchwork Crawler.
* Once Patchwork Crawler leaves the battlefield, it will no longer have the activated abilities of the creature cards exiled with it. If it returns to the battlefield, it will be a new Patchwork Crawler with no connection to those exiled cards.
* If Patchwork Crawler exiles a double-faced card, it will have the activated abilities of only the front face of that exiled card.

Whenever Krothuss, Lord of the Deep attacks, create a tapped and attacking token that's a copy of another target attacking creature. If that creature is a Kraken, Leviathan, Octopus, or Serpent, create two of those tokens instead.


* You choose which opponent or opposing planeswalker the token is attacking as you put it onto the battlefield. It doesn't have to be the same player or planeswalker Krothuss, Lord of the Deep is attacking.
* Although the token is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example, like training).
* The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on. Notably, it doesn't copy any effects that may have turned a noncreature permanent into a creature. If the token isn't a creature as it enters the battlefield, it won't be attacking.
* If the copied creature had {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
* If the copied creature was copying something else, the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature was copying.
* If the copied creature is a token, the token created by Krothuss copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.

Whenever you sacrifice a Blood token, you may have Sanguine Statuette become a 3/3 Vampire artifact creature with haste until end of turn.


* If after becoming a creature, Sanguine Statuette becomes subject to an effect that reduces or increases its toughness, sacrificing another Blood token won't allow you to counteract that effect. For example, if a resolving spell gives it -2/-2 until end of turn, it will be a 1/1 creature, even if you set its power to 3/3 again.
* If another effect sets Sanguine Statuette's power and/or toughness to another number, sacrificing a Blood token will set it back to 3/3. However, it would still be subject to any increases or reductions that are applying, as described above.

* Sigardian Paladin's last ability can target only a creature with a +1/+1 counter on it.

Similarly, a creature card on the battlefield that has been made a noncreature permanent (such as one enchanted with Minimus Containment) will cause this ability to trigger when that card is put into your graveyard.

As long as Voice of the Blessed has four or more +1/+1 counters on it, it has flying and vigilance.  

As long as Voice of the Blessed has ten or more +1/+1 counters on it, it has indestructible.


* The first ability of Voice of the Blessed triggers just once for each life-gaining event, no matter how much life was gained.
* If Voice of the Blessed is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from its ability in time to save it.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Voice of the Blessed's first ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of Voice of the Blessed triggers only once.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the first ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.
* Gaining flying after it has become blocked won't cause Voice of the Blessed to become unblocked.

This is true even if one or more of those permanents is no longer a creature or no longer on the battlefield.

Whenever one or more other creatures with power 2 or less enter the battlefield under your control, draw a card. This ability triggers only once each turn.

Similarly, reducing a creature's power to 2 or less after it enters the battlefield won't cause the ability to trigger.

Whenever you cast a nonlegendary creature spell with flying, you may copy it, except the copy is a 1/1 Spirit in addition to its other types. Do this only once each turn. *(The copy becomes a token.)*


* If a creature spell is copied, it's put onto the battlefield as a token as the spell resolves rather than putting the copy of the spell onto the battlefield. The rules that apply to a permanent spell becoming a permanent apply to a copy of a spell becoming a token.
* The token that a resolving copy of a spell becomes isn't said to have been "created."
* The copy remembers any decisions that were made for the original spell as it was cast, including values chosen for X in its mana cost and whether any alternative or additional costs were chosen. For example, if the original creature spell had kicker and its kicker cost was paid, the copy will also be kicked.

Madness—{2}{B}, Pay 8 life. *(If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)*


* If a player controls more than one creature tied for the greatest power among creatures they control while Shadowgrange Archfiend's first ability is resolving, that player chooses which one of those creatures to sacrifice.
* Cards are discarded in a *Magic* game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards into a player's graveyard from anywhere else do not cause those cards to be discarded.
* Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or because you have too many cards in your hand during your cleanup step. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
* A card with madness that's discarded counts as having been discarded even though it's put into exile rather than a graveyard. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
* A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
* Casting a spell with madness ignores the timing rules based on the card's card type. For example, you can cast a creature with madness if you discard it during an opponent's turn.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a madness cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined by only its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast that spell was.
* If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. Madness doesn't give you another chance to cast it later.
* If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness triggered ability (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
* If you discard a card with madness while a spell or ability is resolving, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability, noting that the card you discarded is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness triggered ability will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.

* If you cast a spell without paying its mana cost, you may choose to pay additional costs (such as kicker) but not alternative costs (such as flashback).
* If you cast a spell with X in its mana cost this way, you must choose 0 as the value for X.

Whenever another nontoken Vampire you control dies, you may pay {1} and exile it. If you do, create a 1/1 black Bat creature token with flying. It gains "When this creature deals combat damage to a player, sacrifice it and return the exiled card to the battlefield tapped."


* Timothar's last ability is linked to the ability it grants the Bat token. If a replacement effect causes you to create more than one Bat token with this effect, they will all have that linked ability, and the exiled card will be returned to the battlefield if any of them deals combat damage to a player.
* If the exiled card is somehow no longer in exile when the Bat token's triggered ability resolves, you will still sacrifice the Bat token.
* If another creature enters the battlefield as a copy of the Bat token or another effect creates a copy of the Bat token, it will have the triggered ability granted by Timothar, but will not be linked to Timothar's ability and will not return the card to the battlefield. The triggered ability it gains, however, will still cause you to sacrifice the copy of the Bat when it deals combat damage to a player.
* The ability of each Bat token you create refers only to the card you exile during the resolution of the ability that created that token. When it deals combat damage to a player, you return only that card to the battlefield, not any other card exiled by Timothar.
* If you can't exile the card, perhaps because another effect moved the card before the triggered ability started resolving, you can't pay {1} and won't create a token.
* Timothar's last ability triggers when any nontoken Vampire you control dies, not just nontoken Vampires you own. If you control Timothar and another player's nontoken Vampire and that Vampire dies, you may pay {1} to exile that card from their graveyard.
* The controller of the Bat token as it deals combat damage to a player will be the controller of its triggered ability, and the exiled card will be returned to the battlefield under that player's control.
