Liliana is quite an old Planeswalker—in all senses of the word. She is centuries old and still going strong thanks to her pact with four demons, *and* she was also one of the first Planeswalker cards in *Magic,* debuting in *Lorwyn*. If you think about it, Liliana is kind of like the *grandma* of the five Origins Planeswalkers.



. . . if grandmothers raised armies of zombies and cast spells of death and destruction, that is.

Long, long ago, on the plane of Dominaria, there once was a young healer who found herself curious about powerful and dangerous spells . . .

Centuries passed as Liliana grew in power . . . and in age. However, Liliana bargained with dark forces and she regained her beauty and youth when the demon Kothophed carved the demonic pact onto Liliana's skin.

Liliana's mastery of dark spells allows her to kill with ease. . .
