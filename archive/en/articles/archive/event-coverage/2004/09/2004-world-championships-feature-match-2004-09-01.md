There's no doubt Jeroen Remie is having a "tremendous month," as he puts it, winning Pro Tour-Seattle with his team, following that up by becoming the Dutch National Champion, and topping it off with a Top 8 appearance at Grand Prix-New Jersey. Facing off against Remie in a second-round feature match was Ben Rubin, winner of two Masters Series events and Grand Prix-Anaheim earlier this season. Both players were running a bunch of artifacts lands in their decks, but while Remie's are used to help power out [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager)s and Affinity, Rubin's are used to help power out [Krark-Clan Ironworks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks) and sundry combo parts.


Jeroen started off with two mulligans, searching for a more aggressive hand. Rubin kept his hand and they were off. Rubin showed right from the start that his affinity deck was something different by playing an [Ancient Den](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Den), [Tree of Tales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tree+of+Tales), and [Talisman of Progress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Progress). The answer as to what deck he was playing soon became apparent when he casually dropped a turn-three [Krark-Clan Ironworks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks) to contend with Remie's [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating)-equipped Disciple of Vault that was lowering Ben's life in six- and seven-point chunks.


Rubin tried to cast [Myr Incubator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Incubator) on turn four, but Remie showed that he too had some tech in his deck by [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ing Rubin's game-ender, forcing Rubin to sacrifice additional artifacts to pay for the counterspell and lowering Ben's life. Remie drew his card and smiled, showing Rubin the [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) he had just drawn, and it was on to game 2.


Remie kept his opening hand in game 2, which held [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), [Furnace Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon), and enough artifact lands to cast the artifact-hoser on turn three. Rubin started out with a turn-two [Thoughtcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast), followed by a Talisman, [Pentad Prism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentad+Prism), and [Fabricate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate) for [Krark-Clan Ironworks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks) on turn three. Unfortunately for him, Remie's third-turn [Furnace Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon) brought a large frown to his face and removed the entire board from the game minus the Dragon itself.


Ben rebuilt with lands and a [Pentad Prism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentad+Prism), taking beats from the Dragon and a new [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) and dropping to seven on a subsequent attack. Two more Prisms let Rubin play Ironworks, and then sacrifice all of his Prisms to play [Myr Incubator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Incubator). Remie's next attack dropped Rubin to one, but Ben simply activated the Incubator at the end of Jeroen's turn, putting a host of 1/1 artifact tokens into play, and earned the concession by pulling out a win from absolutely nothing.


"Wow, that was lucky," observed Rubin. "My draw was pretty insane as well."


"Drawing lands seemed pretty good for you, though," Remie replied.


"Yeah, I drew two of them back to back. It was the only way I had a chance to win that one," answered Rubin.


A turn-one Aether Vial and turn-two [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) formed a solid start for Remie in game 3. Rubin had a second-turn [Leonin Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Elder) to help protect some of his life total as he waited to put together the pieces of his combo puzzle.


![Ben Rubin](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds04/fm2_2.jpg)Rubin paused for a long time on his third turn, considering his options before Fabricating for [Myr Incubator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Incubator). Remie attacked again, this time with a [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus), Ravager, and an [Arcbound Worker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker) before playing a [Vault of Whispers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+of+Whispers) and a [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite), bringing Ben's life back up to a very healthy 16.


Rubin laid a land and cast an Ironworks on his own turn. Another attack dropped Rubin to 10 this time, but Remie couldn't push through enough damage before Ben cast [Myr Incubator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Incubator), activating it to put 32 Myr tokens into play and bumping his life to 44. Remie's only out at that point was to draw a [Furnace Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon) from the top of his deck, but instead his deck taunted him, giving him a second [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) to go along with the one already in his hand.


Final score: Ben Rubin 2, Jeroen Remie 1
