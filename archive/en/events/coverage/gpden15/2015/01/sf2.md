 "Oh you play counters? I don't like counters." Austrian Valentin Mackl was jovially talkative as he always is. He treats the Grand Prix Semifinals the same way he treats any other game of *Magic*. This is now his fifth Grand Prix Top 8, so perhaps it's getting to be old hat to him.



"Hard counters are my favorite." Andrew Brown said. He smiled. Brown had fought long and hard all weekend to get here. Even when Blue-Black Control wins, it's not particularly fast, so each of the fifteen rounds were fairly long. But if he was tired, he didn't show it.


He knew this match-up was in his favor—Abzan Aggro can have a tough time with all the permission of Blue-Black Control—so maybe he was just confident.


"This your first Top 8? Congratulations." Mackl said. 


Brown thanked him, but he wanted more. Brown is roommates with Eugene Hwang, Grand Prix Orlando champion. Brown didn't want him to be the only one with a Grand Prix title.


The two shuffled up and ready to battle.



**The Games**




 The first game started exactly as you think it would: Valentin Mackl asking questions with Andrew Brown providing answers. First, it was [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor), then [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), then [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). Asked & Answered; Asked & Answered; Asked & Answered.




 Soon, the endless dead threats included another [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc), an [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost), and a [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion). It was clear that Mackl was getting frustrated and a bit dejected. He rested his cheek on his fist, with his elbow on the table. This game was not looking good for him. Brown just seemed to have everything.
