Whew! After much research, we present to you the 2009 Pro Tour–Austin Archetype Breakdown! The most popular strategy on the weekend is, unsurprisingly, Zoo. Of the 418 competitors here this weekend, 53 chose to run a traditional Naya Zoo featuring the best red, green, and white cards the format has to offer. However, there were also a host of Zoo spinoffs: Domain Zoo, powered by [Tribal Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribal+Flames) and [Might of Alara](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Alara); Landfall Zoo, powered by [Steppe Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx) and [Plated Geopede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Geopede); Meddling Zoo, which splashes blue for [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage); and Dark Zoo, which utilizes [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) and [Tidehollow Sculler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler).

The runner-up in the popularity contest caught many off guard, however, with Dredge in full force at 51 decks. [Ravenous Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Trap), a new Dredge hate card from *Zendikar*, promises to give those 51 players one more headaches on the weekend, but the power of the Dredge deck's draw engine can't be denied. Next Level Blue was the most popular control deck, with [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) still a favorite win condition when backed by [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision), [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and [Engineered Explosives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives).

The combo of [Dark Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) and [Vampire Hexmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage) drew a lot of attention headed into the Pro Tour, and it has turned out to be wildly successful amongst some of the best play groups in the world. Twenty-five players opted to run the deck in its blue-black form, with a smattering of additional players running black-green versions to utilize [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) and/or [Into the North](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North). Whether the hype can stand up to some ten rounds of Extended play will be determined this weekend.

Rounding out the top five was Extended mainstay Affinity. The robots have been a powerful Extended choice as sideboard hate like [Kataki, War's Wage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kataki%2C+War%27s+Wage) and [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) wane in popularity.


Of course, there are a host of unique choices outside the top five. A crew of pros including Dave Williams, Mark Herberholz, and Patrick Chapin (amongst others) are playing an innovative Next Level Blue style deck featuring [Grove of the Burnwillows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows) and [Punishing Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire).

A number of other competitors, drawn by the power of [Emeria, the Sky Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria%2C+the+Sky+Ruin), have opted to attempt [Martyr of Sands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martyr+of+Sands) strategies; the powerful 1/1 life-gain engine could prove a solid choice in a format where many archetypes are attempting to deal exactly or almost exactly 20 damage.
