Some of **Magic**'s crazier cards in the last few years originated in the *Unglued 2* design file. Since that *Un* set never made it to print, individual card designs crept their way into tournament-legal sets, disguised as legitimate mechanics but maintaining a -- let's say "slightly *off*" -- demeanor.


Let's look at some examples of cards that were originally slated for *Unglued 2*, but eventually made it (in slightly modified form) into other sets:
