Grand Prix Madrid 2010
----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmad10/muller_champ.jpg)Grand Prix–Madrid, the largest **Magic**  tournament of all time, is at an end. 2,227 players were there at the start, but at the very end, it came down to just two. David Do Anh of the Czech Republic had bested Tomoharu Saito, and Andreas Müller had made it through an incredible battle with Richard Bland, to set up for a final between Reanimator and Ad Nauseam Tendrils. These finals came down to the turn of a card, as an agonising Ad Nauseam turned on its master ending the deciding game in decisive fashion. With this, Andreas Müller of Germany found himself on top of the world here in Madrid.


All weekend we have seen innovation and invention, triumphs and bitter defeats as the great and the good from around the world have converged on Madrid for a colossal 20 rounds of Legacy competition. We have seen new takes on old decks, and old cards in new ones, only adding to the diverse metagame for which Legacy is so justly popular. With a whole world of magical cards available to build with, Legacy has shown itself to be full of cool interactions, making for an amazingly entertaining format.


As the lights fade here in Madrid, and we look to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for the next Grand Prix in the calendar in a few short weeks, there are over 2000 people leaving the site with a story to tell. For one player in particular, this story had a very happy ending. Congratulations to Andreas Müller, the Grand Prix–Madrid 2010 Champion!
