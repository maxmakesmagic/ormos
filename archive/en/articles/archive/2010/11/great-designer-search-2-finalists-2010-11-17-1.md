Before receiving the judges feedback, I imagined the Blight would serve only as the inciting incident for the story of Wodotha. Encouraged by the judges to make the Blight into the centerpiece of the story, I knew I had to find it a distinct mechanical role. After three days of false starts, someone suggested the game could accumulate blight counters as a clock to an event where marked permanents would die. I liked the flavor, but was wary of the complexity. Playtesting never clicked until I brought the number of counters needed for destruction all the way down to one. Suddenly, being blighted was a rush, feeling like your marked creature could vanish suddenly. The Blight itself had character in the game.


Making each blight action both destruction and marking makes it so that, under normal circumstances, there's only one blighted permanent at a time. Thus it feels like the Blight chases cards across the table. And, though I only used it once on the final design, it opens possibilities for self-blighting cards to be used as both an advantage and a drawback.


Once blight was locked in place, I decided to design for black, since it had the most space to utilize the mechanic. Because blight was so linear, I wanted the other set mechanics to be more modular. With a sadistic demon as the villain and secret initiator of the Blight, I figured black's flavor could focus on reveling in destruction while the world falls apart.
