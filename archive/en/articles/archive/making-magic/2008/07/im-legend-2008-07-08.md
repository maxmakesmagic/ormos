| **White:** Maro?**Maro:** Hey, White. What are you up to?**White:** I was just cleaning up my desktop.**White:** I'm toying with recategorizing my folders.**Maro:** Sounds like a wild night.**White:** What are you up to?**Maro:** Working on my column. It's Allied Color Week.**White:** Do you know what you're going to write?**Maro:** I don't know. Something that gets me less mail than last week. ;)**White:** Do you have a moment to talk?**Maro:** For my favorite color, White, always.**White:** How well do you know Green?**Maro:** Pretty well.**White:** What I'm about to ask is just between you and me, okay?**White:** You can't tell anyone.**Maro:** Sure.**White:** Could you ever see me and Green together?**Maro:** As a couple?**White:** Yeah.**Maro:** I think so.**Maro:** You guys have a lot in common.**Maro:** I mean you're both real big on community. You both value the importance of the group as a whole.**Maro:** You both love life.**Maro:** You both have a real affinity for small creatures.**Maro:** Mechanically speaking, no two colors overlap as much as the two of you. |

| **Red:** I'm about to do something stupid and I felt like telling someone before I did it.**Maro:** Crazier than the time you lit yourself on fire?**Red:** My mana symbol is a freakin' flame. How do I not play with fire? |

| **IM Conversation With: Red** |  |  |
| 

|  |

| **Maro:** I'd start by talking about something you two have in common.**Red:** Talking really isn't my thing.**Maro:** Sorry, my bad. I forgot who I was talking to. |

| **White:** Okay, how about this?**White:** I can't tell you how cool it is that you've started to have vigilance. We're the only two to know the rush of not tapping to attack.**Maro:** It's a little dry. |

| 

|  |

| **Red:** Maybe a kiss is too subtle.**Red:** We could just jump in the sack.**Maro:** Whoa. Slow down. Do you even have any evidence that Black's attracted to you?**Red:** We're both narcissitic, self-destructive colors that aren't afraid to take bold actions. Isn't that enough?**Maro:** For a one-night stand, maybe.**Red:** Yeah, so?**Red:** You didn't think I was looking for a relationship, did you?**Red:** I'm not so good with commitment. |

| **Green:** Maro.**Maro:** Green! What a surprise.**Green:** Are you busy?**Maro:** You could say that.**Green:** It's no big deal. I'll just catch you later.**Maro:** No, no. I'm just working on next week's article. It can wait.**Maro:** What's on your mind? |

| **Red:** Maybe I should just get Black drunk.**Maro:** No, no, no. If you want to get together with Black you have to find common ground. |

| 

|  |

| **Green:** It wasn't the kind of dream that would make any sense if I explain it.**Green:** Plus it's not the type of thing you write about online.**Green:** Well, unless you're into that kind of thing.**Green:** I'm the last one to keep people from doing what feels right. |

| **Maro:** White, you're forcing it too much. It's got to feel natural.**Maro:** Trust me. You aren't going to attract Green if it doesn't feel natural. |

| 

|  |
| --- |
| **Maro:** Red, I think you need to notch it down a bit.**Maro:** I don't think throwing yourself at Black is what Black would want. It's not exactly Black's style.**Maro:** Black likes to take what it wants. |

| **Red:** Maybe I have to do something to impress Black.**Red:** Maybe I could blow up the house where the party is.**Red:** Black appreciates some good land destruction. |

| 

|  |

| **Green:** My gut's saying I should be with Red, so I'm just going to go for it.**Maro:** Do you want to think this through?**Green:** Thinking it through? Who am I, Blue?**Green:** A color has to follow its instincts. |

 |

| **IM Conversation With: White** |  |  |
| 

|  |

| **White:** I think you're right. I'm overdoing it.**White:** Maybe I should just start by chatting.**White:** I could demonstrate to Green we're compatible by showing how much we have to talk about.**Maro:** That seems like a better plan. |

 |

| **White:** We could talk about flash. We were the first two colors to ever have the ability.**Maro:** Seems a bit touchy. Blue's been hogging the flash spotlight recently, and you know that Green and Blue don't get along.**White:** You're right. |

| **Green:** Don't get me wrong.**Green:** I like White. White's very cool.**Green:** I love hanging out with White.**Green:** White has this spiritual side that I really connect with.**Maro:** But...**Green:** There's just not passion like there is with Red. |

| **Red:** I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought about hooking up with Green.**Red:** Green would be an animal in bed.**Red:** Seriously.**Red:** I love how green acts without thinking.**Red:** A color after my own heart.**Red:** I know we could mindlessly attack together, among other things**Maro:** But...**Red:** I'm just more attracted to the bad color.**Red:** High risk, high reward. |

 Mark: Why Blue?**Black:** Because Blue is smart and smart is sexy. |

| **Maro:** Might intelligence be a drawback?**Maro:** You're a selfish jerk. Isn't Blue going to figure that out?**Maro:** I mean "selfish jerk" in the friendliest way possible.**Black:** I could knock Blue out and we could go back to my apartment.**Maro:** I hear kidnapping isn't the aphrodisiac it once was.**Black:** That's why I'm talking to you.**Black:** What do I do to make Blue want to go out with me? |

| **Maro:** Green, I'm not sure "do nothing" is the most effective plan for starting up a relationship.**Green:** I'm not doing nothing. I'll be me. I'll be there.**Green:** You have to trust me when I say I really grow on others. |

| **Black:** What are Blue's vulnerabilities?**Black:** That's probably the best place to look for an opening.**Maro:** Have you ever considered hooking up with Red?**Black:** Red's crazy.**Black:** I love that about Red.**Black:** Red makes me laugh.**Black:** Red and I always have such a great time when we're together.**Black:** No one makes arson as much fun as Red.**Maro:** So why don't you hook up with Red?**Black:** Red's fun for the moment, but not exactly the most reliable color.**Black:** Plus if my lover's going to die, I really want to be the one to do it.**Black:** Red's just so hard to trust.**Maro:** Red's hard to trust?**Maro:** That's like the pot calling the kettle black.**Black:** I am Black. |

There's a party tonight.**Blue:** Yeah.**Maro:** And you want to hook up with someone?**Blue:** Exactly.**Maro:** I'm guessing it would be White.**Blue:** You figured this all out how?**Maro:** It came to me while I was online. |

| **Red:** You have me all confused.**Red:** What crazy thing am I going to do to get Black interested?**Maro:** Find common ground.**Red:** You're a wild man.**Red:** Maybe we could sit around and plan retirement portfolios.**Red:** What if I start by punching Black in the face?**Red:** That would get Black's attention.**Maro:** What are we, on the playground?**Red:** Black respects power.**Red:** If I could go toe to toe with Black, I think Black might find that sexy. |

| **Black:** I'm interested in Blue, not Red.**Maro:** Why Blue?**Black:** I like subtlety. The rest of the colors couldn't be subtle if their life depended on it.**Black:** But Blue. Blue fakes right before it jabs left.**Black:** Blue will mill someone right out while they're checking their life total.**Black:** Plus, Blue knows the value of denial.**Black:** Sure, Blue uses it on the stack while I prefer to be even more preemptive, but still we're the only two colors that stop you from ever playing the spell.**Maro:** I'll be honest. For two allied colors you two barely overlap.**Black:** Maybe not in mechanics, but we definitely share certain sensibilities.**Black:** There's no other color that can kill you before you figure out what they're up to.**Black:** Plus blue knows stuff.**Black:** Knowledge is power and you know how much I love power. |

| **Blue:** So I've been thinking about whether or not White and I have any chance.**Blue:** And I believe we do.**Maro:** Why White? I always thought you and Black might hook up.**Blue:** I've thought about it.**Blue:** Black's definitely the next smartest color. We're the two most tutor-friendly colors.**Blue:** It makes very efficient use of its resources. After me, Black is the best raw card-drawer.**Blue:** Black knows what it wants.**Maro:** But...**Blue:** Danger Will Robinson!**Blue:** Black is charismatic but very scary.**Blue:** Black can easily turn on you.**Blue:** White, on the other hand, is much more predictable.**Blue:** You know what you get with White.**Blue:** White has stability.**Blue:** Most importantly, you know White's going to do the right thing. |

| **White:** What if I start out by giving Green a small power / toughness boost?**White:** We could bond over something we both love to do.**White:** My only fear is that Green's a little more into buffing creatures than I am. |

| **Blue:** I thought about this all night and I think I know how to approach White.**Maro:** How?**Blue:** Text message.**Blue:** I connect with White through our love of language and words.**Blue:** I remind White how I too love flying and flash and protection.

It's kind of cute. White can show how much overlap we have.**Blue:** White will clearly see, as I have, the clarity of such a union.**Blue:** I have no need to rush.**Blue:** Tonight is just about making the first contact.**Blue:** Just letting White know what I'm thinking.**Blue:** We're going to take it slow.**Maro:** What do you need from me?**Blue:** Just some information.**Blue:** Is White coming to tonight's party? |

| **Black:** Blue's coming to the party?**Maro:** I have it on pretty good authority.**Black:** I could slip a mickey in Blue's drink.**Maro:** Enough with the plans of incapacitation.**Maro:** If you want to be with Blue, you're going to have to find a way to make Blue want to be with you.**Maro:** Scheme a little less and think a little more. |

| **Maro:** White, have you ever thought about maybe hooking up with Blue?**White:** I have. We definitely have a similar temperament.**White:** Blue's the only other color that really ever thinks ahead.**White:** And Blue's the only other color that understands the value of a proper defense.**Maro:** Sounds like you two would hit it off.**White:** We definitely click.**Maro:** But...**White:** Blue's just a little cold.**White:** Green really has a warm sense of being that I find very attractive.**White:** I feel like Green and I just share a closer set of values.**White:** Green makes me feel better about myself. |
