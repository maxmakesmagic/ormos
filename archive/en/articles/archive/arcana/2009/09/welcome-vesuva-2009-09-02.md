This is [Vesuva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva), illustrated for *Time Spiral* by Zoltan Boros & Gabor Szikszai.

Now, that's Vesuva as seen after a temporal catastrophe has reduced much of Dominaria to wreckage. When *Planechase* came around, Vesuva was one of the Dominarian locations chosen, which meant that Vesuva could be portrayed in all its glory. We went back to Zoltan and Gabor and asked them to extrapolate from their previous image (and the reflection in the water, which, you'll notice, shows an undamaged Vesuva) to show a Vesuva in its prime. This is what they gave us.

Very nice! As a bonus, check out this incredibly detailed sketch they made.
