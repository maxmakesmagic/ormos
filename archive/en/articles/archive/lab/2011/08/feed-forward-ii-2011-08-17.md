Hello and welcome back to the Lab. As advertised, this week marks the return of Feedback Week. Today's column will feature emails and reader decks from Internet-goers just like you. And if you scroll all the way down (restrain yourselves, though) you'll see the results of the contest poll I held a fortnight ago.

I was pondering the notion of feedback for this column, and it came to me that you all might want some from my own person. Although technically, since I'm doing the original feeding, I can't feed back. Call it feeding forward. Either way, I'd just like to take some quick (or not so quick) paragraphs to bare my soul for a bit.
