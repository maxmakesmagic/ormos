* [**Friday, 9:41 a.m.: Modern Metagame Madness**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/11philadelphia/ptphi_1.mp3) (20.2 MB)
 Day One of Pro Tour Philadelphia, day one of Modern as a tournament format, Day One of what should be an amazing three days of **Magic**. In the hour before the tournament starts, we delve into the fray, talking to some of the greats of the game, and some of the players waiting to take their shot at joining the pantheon. Everything you need to kickstart your understanding of Modern, right here, from the people who are making it happen. 


* [**Friday, 5:40 p.m.: Sitdown with Jon Finkel**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/11philadelphia/ptphi_2.mp3) (7.9 MB)
 No need to hype this one, is there? One of the greatest players ever to play the game sits down with us on the eve of Pro Tour Philadephia to talk about winning in Kuala Lumpur, his 94-year-old grandfather, Modern, his hopes for the weekend, and his new charity venture. Stop reading. Start listening. 


* [**Saturday, 11:37 a.m.: Inside Magic with Aaron Forsythe**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/11philadelphia/ptphi_3.mp3) (8.3 MB)
 It's not often you get to hear about what's going on in R&D direct from the man at the head of the chain, but Aaron Forsythe is in town this weekend, and now he's on air, talking about day to day life inside Wizards HQ, his favorite cards, decks, his take on Standard, Modern, and the state of the game as a whole. Always great company, Aaron's your man for all the inside news and views. 


* [**Saturday, 6:21 p.m.: On The Edge of the Top 8**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/11philadelphia/ptphi_4.mp3) (16.7 MB)
 On 36 points, Josh Utter-Leyton knows that he's perhaps as little as one solitary point away from the Top 8. His American opponent Andrej Prost won't make it easy for him, however. For Vincent Lemoine and Chikara Nakajima, both know that a win here will take them to 36 points with one round to play. The loser, probably out of contention. The winner, right in the thick of it. Finally, a blockbuster match sees Australia's Jeremy Neeman take on Luis Scott-Vargas. Both players are on 30 points at 10-4, so for them it's as simple as win twice, then wait and see. Join us for all the key moments as they happen, including some murderously blistering action as we head towards the first Modern Pro Tour Top 8. 


* [**Winner Interview**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/11philadelphia/ptphi_5.mp3) (4.1 MB)
 Rich Hagon interviews Pro Tour Philadelphia champion Samuele Estratti in the moments after defeating Josh Utter-Leyton in the Finals of the Pro Tour.
