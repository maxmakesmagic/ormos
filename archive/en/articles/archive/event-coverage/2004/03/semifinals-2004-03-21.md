![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpsen04/sasaki.jpg)Yusuke Sasaki has served his one year suspension, and now he's back with a vengeance. He made Top 8 at Grand Prix Shizuoka back in the fall, and now has another Grand Prix Top 8 for the season. With two more match wins, he'll be able to do one better and win the whole thing. ### Game 1


Sasaki played Sunstrike Trident, and Shimura played [Oxidda Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Golem) on turn three, getting through for damage. A [Nim Lasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Lasher) was 3/1 thanks to Sasaki's [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel), but it quickly died to [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt), clearing the way for another Golem attack. Sasaki's [Nim Abomination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Abomination) stopped the Golem from attacking, at least for a turn. The Abomination attacked for three, and Sasaki played [Wizard Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica). It blocked the Golem and forced a trade, thanks to a [Tooth of Chiss-Goria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+of+Chiss-Goria). Shimura was stuck with only four mountains, lacking a plains with a hand full of white cards. Sasaki took advantage, playing an [Arcbound Hybrid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Hybrid+) to attack for six. Shimura was too far behind to catch up, and conceded.

### Game 2


Shimura played a first turn [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), and cracked it to play a second turn [Leonin Skyhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter). Sasaki had a second turn Myr, and smashed with an [Arcbound Hybrid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Hybrid+) on turn three. The Skyhunter attacked back, and Shimura played [Hematite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hematite+Golem). Sasaki summoned [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite), and kept his creatures back on defense. The Skyhunter continued attacking, and Shimura put more threats in the air with [Slith Ascendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Ascendant). [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate) killed the Golem, and Sasaki's team came through for five damage. Shimura's fliers attacked for three, and the Slith grew to 2/2. [Arcbound Bruiser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Bruiser) came out on the ground, and was bigger than anything Sasaki had. Unable to go on offense without losing a creature, Sasaki played [Slagwurm Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagwurm+Armor), put it on [Silver Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr), and said go. This gave Shimura free reign to attack with his fliers, and [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar) along with [Emissary of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emissary+of+Hope) finished it up.

### Game 3


Sasaki played a first turn [Slagwurm Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagwurm+Armor), and Shimura played [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar). Sasaki played [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) on turn three, and Shimura summoned [Oxidda Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Golem), keeping it back. [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica) built up Sasaki's side a little more, and Shimura's Golem grabbed the Scimitar to get through for four damage. Shimura put the Armor on the Replica, and Shimura went to the air with [Pteron Ghost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost), giving it the Scimitar. Shimura targeted the Golem with [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica), perhaps looking to get a trade with the Ghost, but Shimura had [Razor Barrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Barrier). Sasaki's [Nim Lasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Lasher) died to [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt), and he was quickly falling behind. A second [Nim Lasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Lasher) took the [Slagwurm Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagwurm+Armor) to provide a much needed blocker, but the Ghost was still swinging for two damage a turn. After a few attacks, Sasaki found an answer in [Echoing Decay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay). Shimura played an [Arcbound Bruiser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Bruiser), and gave the Golem the Scimitar. It attacked, and pumped to trade with the Armored Lasher. Shimura still had white mana available, and used it to play [Leonin Skyhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter). 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpsen04/shimura.jpg)Sasaki used [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate) to kill the [Oxidda Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Golem), and played a [Nim Shrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker). It donned the Armor, and was now a 4/7 flier. He was at five, but seemed to have the board stabilized. Shimura played [Rustmouth Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rustmouth+Ogre), and put the Scimitar on the Bruiser. Sasaki played [Wall of Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Blood) and Sunstrike Trident, which provided him with a win condition while neither played could successfully attack. Shimura played Rustpore Ram to destroy the [Slagwurm Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagwurm+Armor), making combat a far more attractive proposition. He put the Scimitar on the Ogre, and attacked with all his creatures, which was enough to convince Sasaki to concede.
