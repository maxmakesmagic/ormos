### August 5, 1993: **Magic** Is Released

Although **Magic** was first shown at Origins '93, it wasn't until August 5, 1993 that the public was first able to purchase **Magic: The Gathering** at Gen Gon.

The first printing contained nearly ten million cards, sold in sixty-card decks (containing two cards from the rare sheet, thirteen cards from the uncommon sheet, and forty-five cards from the common sheet) and fifteen-card booster packs (containing one rare, three uncommon, and eleven common cards).

Alpha's total print run was 2.6 million cards, and that ran out quickly. Beta came out in October and fixed a few errors. To see one of the errors in action, check out yesterday's Arcana, which features an [Orcish Oriflamme](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Oriflamme) being cast for only two mana at a tournament at that same Gen Con. That means yesterday's Arcana is also an entry into "This Week In Magic History", since it commemorates something that happened August 6 or 7, 1993.
