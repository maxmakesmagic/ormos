*What's your favorite **Magic** Vampire, and why?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_miketurian.jpg)**Mike Turian:** [Skeletal Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Vampire) is my favorite **Magic** Vampire. I was a developer on *Guildpact*. It was the first **Magic** expansion I worked on, and I was excited to see a Vampire in the set. Not only a Vampire, but a Vampire Skeleton! And it has amazing art by Wayne Reynolds.

I really enjoy that Skeletal Vampire is an expensive creatures that is tough to kill. On top of that I love the idea of a Vampire that brings along his own bats.

The *Guildpact* development team was searching the perfect flavor of the Bat eating Vampire when we came upon the idea that the [Skeletal Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Vampire) could not only eat Bats to save himself, but would also eat Bats to make ... more Bats!
