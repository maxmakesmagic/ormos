Yes, you read the little window decal on the front page image correctly: it's Core Set Week. Is it shocking that an exclamation point was missing at the end of the previous sentence? Since I get a little *excited* about most things **Magic** related, am I unexcited about Core Set Week?

Quite the contrary, actually.

Talking about the "most basic" sets in **Magic** is a different kind of excitement for me. It's quiet, soft, and caring. It has a loud voice from time to time, but it's more about kind words shared around a small table. The Core Set is where **Magic** comes home, and it's where I go to introduce friends to the game.
