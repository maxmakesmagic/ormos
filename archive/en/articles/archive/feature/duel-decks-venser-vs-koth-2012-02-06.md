### Collector's Highlights


Each of the cards in the two 60-card decks will be black-bordered and tournament legal. This means that these cards are legal for use in any tournaments where the original printings are still legal.

***Two Planeswalkers, one compassionate, one calculating, gave their all to save a world.***


*The Planeswalker Koth, from the metal plane of Mirrodin, sought help when his world darkened. He traveled to Dominaria to enlist allies and met fellow Planeswalker Venser.*


*When Venser recognized the threat to Koth’s world was none other than Phyrexia, he knew that the only hope for Mirrodin was to find its maker. But that would mean forsaking its people in the meantime.*


*Koth would rather die than turn his back on his fellow Mirrans. But Venser knew they would all die anyway if they failed to reach Karn, his former mentor and creator of Mirrodin.*


*Two Planeswalkers, one goal, very different methods. Recreate the struggle to lead the way to Mirrodin’s salvation.*
