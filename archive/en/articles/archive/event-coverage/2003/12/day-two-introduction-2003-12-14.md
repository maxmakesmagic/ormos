 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






DayTwo of Grand Prix: Anaheim is under way! It is a little early for most players' tastes but they *are* playing on Day Two and sleeping in is cold comfort for players who are not among those rubbing their eyes this morning. The small starting field of 273 has been pared down to almost a fourth of its starting size. It will be interesting to see if the degenerate decks rise to the top now that most of the field has been cleared away or will the Tog players, Red Deck Winners, and meta-game analysts emerge on top.

Kibler may have denied rumors of the formation of a new team but all of the players "not" on that team made Day Two including four players wielding a Scepter Tog deck designed by Jeff Cunningham. Hmmmm… 

A number of players are chasing after qualifications today. Both Mike Pustilnik and Rob Dougherty are in danger of falling off the Pro Tour Circuit come Kobe and need strong performances on Day Two to have that not come to pass. A pair of Magic dinosaurs-Eric "EDT" Taylor and Frank Gilson-are also lumbering through the second day of competition.

Speaking of dinosaurs… The youngest dinosaur, Ben Rubin was undefeated at 7-0-1 coming into today's action. He professes to not care about qualifying. It will be interesting to see how he can do with his Dump Truck-a heavily meta-gamed version of Fiends. 

Stay tuned for all the action. Top 64 decklists will be posted at the conclusion of round fourteen.
