I feel like I might be noticing a pattern here this weekend. Alex Sittner has a couple of Grand Prix Top 8s to his name, which is pretty solid, but he would no doubt like to add a Pro Tour Top 8 to that. No, that's not the pattern, I'm pretty sure everyone here wants one of those. What I mean is people like Sittner are having to battle through people like 21st-ranked Ben Stark. People who not only have Pro Tour Top 8s, but have Pro Tour wins, and are in the Hall of Fame. 


Apparently we have an unprecedented number of Hall of Fame members playing here this weekend, which I guess might have something to do with the fact that the number of Hall of Fame members increases each year, but probably has more to do with the fact that we're in Hawaii. I mean, have you seen pictures of Hawaii? It's pretty sweet.


Anyway, down to business now, and down to the beach later. Sittner's sitting on Naya Planeswalkers, while Stark has Jeskai Aggro. While Jeskai Aggro can certainly opt to play a more controlling game if it needs to, this is one of the match-ups where Stark will have to play the aggressor, because failure to do so will result in him getting mobbed by Planeswalkers asking for autographs and to pose with him for selfies and stuff.




*Alex Sittner's Round 7 was one of many matches featuring players with solid finishes at the Pro Tour level and Grand Prix circuit going toe-to-toe with Hall of Famers in attendance.*
