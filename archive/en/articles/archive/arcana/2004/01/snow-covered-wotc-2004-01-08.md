The Seattle area gets an average of less than 9 inches (23 cm) of snowfall per year, so when a snowstorm socked the Pacific Northwest on Monday night and Tuesday, it caused some havoc. Wizards of the Coast itself was lightly dusted, but employees in the surrounding areas were hit harder, unable defrost their cars or take to the roads. Most took Tuesday off -- except for one intrepid photographer (Kevin Endo of the web team). Check out these pics he took of the WotC Winter Wonderland corporate office!


*Note: Paul Barclay reports that [snow covered wotc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=snow%2Bcovered%2Bwotc)'s Oracle text will include the keyword "Snow-covered", so you can tap it to pump [Karplusan Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karplusan+Giant), destroy it with [Avalanche](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche), etc. Just so you know.*




*Yeah, I know, a lot of places got hit a lot harder. But remember, Seattle has very little snow removal, and the ice caused a power outage.*



*Everybody likes a snow day!*



*As of today (Thursday), the [Melting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melting) is complete. That might be it for Seattle snow this year.*
