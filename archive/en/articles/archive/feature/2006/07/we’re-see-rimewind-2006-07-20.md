Michael Flores is the author of Deckade and The Official Miser's Guide; the designer of numerous State, Regional, Grand Prix, National, and Pro Tour–winning decks; and the onetime editor-in-chief of The Magic Dojo. He'd claim allegiance to Dimir (if such a Guild existed)… but instead will just shrug "Simic." 






A young girl, displaced by natural disaster, travels by song and golden path towards the legendary metropolis of a faraway magician (just don't look behind the curtain). Her traveling companions: an unfortunate pooch, from home, doesn‘t count; local retinue: a tin man, armed with an axe; a coward; someone quite flammable, yearning for a brain. This, altogether, is *Darksteel*.

*Darksteel* was a set of peerless vigor. It gave us [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager), the potent tin man with [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) strapped to its side. *Darksteel* gave white its most annoying card to hide behind, *ever*, in [Pulse of the Fields](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Fields), a cowardly tool never played in the same deck as [Savannah Lions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions). In [Pulse of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Forge), the set provided a card that, on its face, was less powerful than Pulse of the Fields, but rewarded expertise in mathematical offense, a thinking man's burn spell stapled to a sort of expressly Red look at card advantage, perfect for someone interested in pushing the limits of his **Magic** brain.

To great degree, *Coldsnap* reminds me of *Darksteel* (one of *Coldsnap*'s strongest cards even melds the names of the two sets). Both have unusual and unique methods to re-buy cards in hand (Recover versus conditional hammers), but, more importantly, they aggressively forward pervasive and synergistic mechanics that touch and utilize many cards to create a whole that far exceeds the individual strength of any individual creature, artifact, or land. For *Darksteel*, we saw a mighty interplay between Artifact Lands, Modular, and Affinity for Artifacts that produced the fearsome tag team of [Disciple of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) and [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager). While we can only pray that *Coldsnap* ends up less overwhelmingly powerful in its theme, the long lost third set is stamped all over with Snow.

This is going to be a review of some key Snow mechanic cards from *Coldsnap*. Because this is Swimming With Sharks, rather than cover *all* the Snow cards, I am just going to discuss some of the cards that I think might have some legitimate impact in Constructed tournament **Magic**. Let's begin!

### [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets) and the Snow Lands

![Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scrying+Sheets)Without a doubt, the most important and powerful Snow card is [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets). [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets) is a five star, All-Star, flagship, deck centerpiece if ever there was one. This card can serve as a one-sided Mikokoro, a [Jayemdae Tome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jayemdae+Tome) that doesn't require an, um, *actual Jayemdae Tome*, perhaps a discounted [Whispers of the Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispers+of+the+Muse) or slow [Land Tax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land+Tax). With half Snow cards in your deck, [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets) ends up being a bit better than [Whispers of the Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispers+of+the+Muse) as a card advantage engine, in fact. You spend six mana and get about one card (only you don't have to burn a slot on a [Whispers of the Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispers+of+the+Muse)). With [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), playing just a bit more than one-third Snow cards will net you a card for just *four*.Getting one-third to one-half Snow cards into your deck is quite easy *because you don‘t have to spend a lot of spell slots on them*. Along with [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets), you have your pick of more than ten other Snow Lands. Between allied dual lands and Snow-Covered Basic Lands, filling out your mana base will not be difficult (just remember to re-align your thinking to pre-*Ravnica* Block mana base rules). Of the Basic Lands, Snow-Covered Island is the best, not because Blue is the best color (even if it may be), but because Blue finally has the opportunity to run [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) for Island, Snow-Covered Island, Oboro, and Minamo!

Next to [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets), the most important and powerful Snow card is [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North); as we've said, [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets) is very good, and playing [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North) allows you to essentially play twice as many copies of [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets), and benefit from additional value. Look at how nicely it curves…

You can play [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North) on the second turn and you will immediately have three lands, including [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets), on the third. If you have nothing else to do, you can just flip the Sheets and cross your fingers. If you haven't played another land - and let's face it, you are most likely to make this play when you don't have one - you probably have better than a one-in-three of hitting your land drop as a free card, which you can then play.

Now imagine you have [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top)… You play the Top on the first turn. You play [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North) on the second. On the third turn, because you are very greedy, you use the Top on upkeep to ensure your next land drop *and* your next free Snow draw. The beauty of it is that you can keep doing this *the rest of the game* if you want.

![Into_the_North](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/CSP/Into_the_North.jpg)Beyond setting up what may well become the Standard format's defining card drawing engine, [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North) is just a powerful accelerator and color fixing device. [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North) compares reasonably with [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek), a card that has repeatedly shown up in the elimination rounds, in the decks of Constructed Pro Tour standouts from Frank Karsten to Tomohiro Kaji. While [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) was great in its era, [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) earned additional value in its ability to find cards like [Temple Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Garden); [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North) does the same with [Arctic Flats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arctic+Flats) and its allied cycle. [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North) is a little behind in that it has no Snow-Covered [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) to get, but that's not really the Sorcery's fault (and no one is holding it against [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) that it can't go get basic Forest). [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North) will be spectacular in Snow.

On top of the lands that just tap for mana, [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North) can draw additional Snow Lands [Mouth of Ronom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mouth+of+Ronom) and [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths). [Mouth of Ronom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mouth+of+Ronom) obviously has some utility, seeing as it can tap for colorless or shoot down [Loxodon Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch), but it is a little pricey. I see it as a card that may or may not see heavy play. [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) is just bad. Really. It's bad. And by “bad” I mean “terrible.” Like you would not want to play it. It's a bad card that costs you a land drop. It's terrible and will never be good. *And you'll lose to it*. You will definitely lose to this bad, terrible, land-leeching, thirty-mana play, likely more than once. That said, knowing that [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) is bad will allow you to complain about how you just lost to such a terrible card with greater ire and sophistication.

### One Mana Plays

Sometimes it is okay to play sub-optimal cards because they fit mechanically into a deck's theme. For example, you play [Eye of Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Nowhere) in Vore *because* it is a sorcery. Does it make sense? [Boomerang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boomerang) is just a better card, doing essentially the same job as [Eye of Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Nowhere), but at instant speed. Remember, though, that the Vore deck loves sorceries in particular, so that limitation is actually the reason we play [Eye of Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Nowhere). [Boreal Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid) is a strictly weaker card in terms of functionality versus mana cost than [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) or Block brother [Fyndhorn Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fyndhorn+Elves), but it will see play in Snow decks. [Boreal Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid) is a Snow permanent! You can find it with [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets) or tap it to pick up [Stalking Yeti](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Yeti). While “worse” than [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) in the generic [mana] sense, in a deck that relies heavily on the Snow theme, [Boreal Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid) can sometimes do more.

On the other end of the spectrum you have [Skred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred). This Red removal spell has a lot in common with [Boreal Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid). It costs one mana. It is Snow-stamped. Unlike [Boreal Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid), which is slightly less efficient than other options, [Skred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred) is maybe the *most* efficient spot elimination spell since [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares)! The catch is, [Skred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred) is *only* spectacular in a dedicated Snow deck. If you play it on the first turn using your Snow-Covered Mountain, [Skred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred) is a [Lava Dart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Dart). On the next turn, it is a [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) or [Firebolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt). At three it's a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) (and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) costs half the mana as perfectly good alternative [Volcanic Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer)). Past that point, [Skred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred) is off any recognizable power curve, costing you a paltry *two* mana only when you are aiming it at [Grand Arbiter Augustin IV](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Arbiter+Augustin+IV). In any other color, [Skred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred) would be an automatic four-of in the main deck. If it is not there in Red Snow decks, that is only because Red already has efficient *general* burn spells, and [Skred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred) is being held in reserve for sideboarded games when the Red player *knows for certain* he is up against creatures (it's not useful against [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), for example).

### Artifacts

Beyond the Big Two ([Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets) and [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North)), I predict the most played Snow card will be [Coldsteel Heart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coldsteel+Heart). We are already living and playing in an era where even some aggressive Standard and *Ravnica*-themed decks are playing four or more Signets. [Coldsteel Heart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coldsteel+Heart) is worse than a Signet in Guild colors (it comes into play tapped after turn 2), but it is strictly better than at least five cards that saw tournament play ([Sky Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sky+Diamond) & co). Though somewhat weaker in a G/W deck than, say, [Selesnya Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Signet), [Coldsteel Heart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coldsteel+Heart) can go into a Snow deck to up the count for [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets)… Think of it as the Snow theme's answer to Vore's [Eye of Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Nowhere). 

[Phyrexian Ironfoot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Ironfoot) holds the title for Matt Cavotta's favorite card [name] in the new set. A 3/4 for three mana with a significant mana drawback is not going to break any efficiency records in Standard, not with [Burning-Tree Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Shaman) potentially on the other side of the table, but we've certainly seen control decks work with worse. Andrew Cuneo's original Draw-Go deck played [Steel Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Golem) as its kill card, and while [Phyrexian Ironfoot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Ironfoot) is both a slightly better early game defender and flat-out worse end game beater than [Steel Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Golem) was, you can't really take away the fact that it might be a free card (or that in the very late game, it can play a kind of dim-witted cousin to [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel)). I wouldn't expect this card to be played in the heavy Green Snow decks, but there is already talk of post-Kamigawa Block Blue Snow decks… This Phyrexian might just get his foot in the door in one of those.

### Key Creatures

I [already talked about Ohran Viper](/en/articles/archive/damned-if-you-do-2006-06-29), so I am just going to skip ahead to the big guys.


Half a [Debtors' Knell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debtors%27+Knell), more significant than a [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel), [Adarkar Valkyrie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Valkyrie) is arguably the best of the Snow finishers. For one thing, she is only six mana rather than seven. For another, there is a greater incentive to G/W/x Snow than any other color combination at present (I think), just because of what dual lands you can play. [Adarkar Valkyrie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Valkyrie) is just the best available lady for the job. 

Probably the most dominating Snow finisher once it is actually in play, [Rimescale Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rimescale+Dragon) is a powerhouse in need of a deck. There is no question this card would fill in as a slightly less efficient *Kamigawa* Dragon in dedicated G/R Snow… The question is why you would *want* to play G/R Snow. Again speaking from the Swimming With Sharks Constructed Tournament perspective, the incentives to G/R are elsewhere, namely [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) and [Giant Solifuge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Solifuge). Standard G/R decks beat control on brutal offense and by quickly reaching the fundamental turn, and beat creatures via the relative efficiency of their drops, often combined with the relentless offense of [Moldervine Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak)… G/R Snow would have completely different incentives and necessarily eschew what makes Green and Red [together] good in Standard, while in all likelihood simultaneously forgetting any dream world of besting the Top Tier Blue decks. I can see such a deck having competitive incentives, especially with [Stalking Yeti](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Yeti) as yet another option for [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets), and even if that Yeti is nothing more than a slow [Cackling Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cackling+Flames)… I just don't see it happening today, or as long as there is a [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) to exploit in Standard.

All that said, [Rimescale Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rimescale+Dragon) is quite impressive should it resolve. The mana counts imply that this Dragon will be able to contain most any boards, two permanents at a time, short of [Simic Sky Swallower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Sky+Swallower)… but therein lies the rub. In a seven-on-seven fight, [Rimescale Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rimescale+Dragon) is no [Simic Sky Swallower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Sky+Swallower). I am certainly not saying it will see *no* play as long as [Simic Sky Swallower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Sky+Swallower) is in Standard, just pointing out that there are existing incentives to other creatures at its huge mana cost.

[Rimefeather Owl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rimefeather+Owl) is yet another victim of [Simic Sky Swallower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Sky+Swallower). Despite the fact that the Owl will generally be *bigger* than the ubiquitous *Ravnica* Block chase finisher, this thematic Bird nevertheless has a couple of things going against it: 1) Because Snow decks will necessarily have to play *Coldsnap* lands, players will have no [Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool) and [Simic Growth Chamber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber) to set up ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) in a base-Green Snow deck consistently; you've got to assume that it will be frustrating to hit seven but lack the necessary ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) to make your key play (that said, with [Coldsteel Heart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coldsteel+Heart) and [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North), maybe ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) will be a mortal lock by turn 7 - we don't have enough data yet). 2) [Rimefeather Owl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rimefeather+Owl) might be big, but it dies “to everything” and doesn't trample. Of course if it is left unchecked it will win the game quickly, but *all* tournament sevens can make the same claim. Even more closely because of its color, this is another case of a Snow seven possibly being passed over due to competition with [Simic Sky Swallower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Sky+Swallower), Leviathan of a thousand incentives.

Don't get me wrong. I really like [Rimefeather Owl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rimefeather+Owl) and am currently investigating ways to break it along with [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets) (perhaps the aforementioned post-rotations Blue Snow deck will give it a home?), but I would be surprised if it took any of the immediate summer Championship events. That said, I would be quite *pleasantly* surprised.

### The Maybes

![Gelid Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gelid+Shackles)[Gelid Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gelid+Shackles) is an interesting card. It might be better than [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) in an aggressive Snow deck in the same way that [Blessed Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Breath) might be better than [Bathe in Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bathe+in+Light) for a less dramatic effect just because it is one mana and it is sometimes useful to be Arcane. The 800 pound gorilla attached to this one mana enchantment is that it lacks the characteristic “unless they're mana abilities” that you will see on [Faith's Fetters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters) and similarly templated cards *these* days. You can drop [Gelid Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gelid+Shackles) on [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and all that target is going to be doing (unless it's playing advance man for a [Ninja of the Deep Hours](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours)) will be wishing it could chump block your [Rimefeather Owl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rimefeather+Owl) six turns later. [Blizzard Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blizzard+Specter) is just better than [Abyssal Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abyssal+Specter) in B/U. Therefore this is a card that is really hurt by the lack of a Block format. I won my first Pro Tour invitation at an *Ice Age* / *Alliances* PTQ in 1996 playing [Abyssal Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abyssal+Specter), but no one has really played that card in Standard since even though it has been legal almost continuously since Fifth Edition. If *Coldsnap* were a part of a small set format like an organized Block, my guess is that it would be played either in some sort of [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets) splash where *everyone* is slow, or as a relatively solid creature on its own merits.

Huh?

In case you missed it, I really like Snow and have thought a lot about Snow decks. The only thing I don't get is Green's glaring paucity in the Snow-Covered Fatty Boom Boom department. This is a color and a theme that have been married since the inception of expansions: *Green should have some in-theme giant*. That giant might not be very good ([Jugan, the Rising Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jugan%2C+the+Rising+Star), [Myojin of Life's Web](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myojin+of+Life%27s+Web)), but Green should have it.

My guess is that R&D wanted to limit how good the already great [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets) could be in the most obvious deck, because Green *also* has no serviceable medium creature. To wit, [Ohran Yeti](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ohran+Yeti) (which is not good enough for Constructed, but that is neither here nor there) and [Stalking Yeti](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Yeti) (which might be good enough) are both Snow creatures… but [Karplusan Strider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karplusan+Strider), also a Yeti, is not. This seems to me deliberate.

That's it for my first impressions of the Snow mechanic, something I think we'll see in top decks for the next two years. Just remember that even if the weather outside is frightful… well, that's no reason that the decks should be.
