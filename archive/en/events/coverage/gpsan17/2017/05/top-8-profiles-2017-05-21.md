[Liliana's Mastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Mastery) and [Lord of the Accursed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Accursed), because they make my Zombies immense.

2 GP Top 8s, a few PT Top 16s


**What Standard deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Temur Marvel. I was practicing my roulette skills for a long time, so I knew I could handle Marvel. To do well in the current Standard, you need to play Marvel and get lucky, so that's what I did.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) into [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger).


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Manglehorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manglehorn). It helps against players that are more lucky than you.


**What's your favorite memory from the weekend so far?**


I met Katherine in a café.

Temur Marvel. The Pro Tour showed the deck had the best win percentages, and with Team Artaza, we merged version from the Pro Tour.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger), because even without Marvel it gave me a lot of games.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Confiscation Coup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscation+Coup); it gave me a couple of games. And [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker), for card advantage.


**What's your favorite memory from the weekend so far?**


Playing [Confiscation Coup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscation+Coup), stealing an [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) after my opponent played [Dispossess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispossess), and connecting an Ulamog.

[Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), great against the mirror.

Island, best card in the game.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Thing in the Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice). It allows the deck to be more proactive after sideboard when needed.

Finals of a PPTQ, won a PPTQ online, five 5-0s on Magic Online


**What Standard deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Unlicensed Disintegration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration). It won me a lot of games.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Transgress the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind), because I hate [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel).


**What's your favorite memory from the weekend so far?**


Traveling with my friends and winning my win-and-in with an unorthodox play: I used my last loyalty counter of [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance) to crew [Heart of Kiran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Kiran) and trade for an attacking [Wandering Fumarole](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wandering+Fumarole). My opponent didn't expect it because it was my only attacking creature, but it won me the game because I had another [Heart of Kiran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Kiran) in hand.

**Previous Magic accomplishments**:


-


**What Standard deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


R/G Monsters, because it is a great deck. My friends told me that it is the deck that I play better. Also, I like the energy and monster theme.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Bristling Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bristling+Hydra), because it is hard to kill in the current meta. And with [Rhonas the Indomitable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhonas+the+Indomitable), it is a deadly combination.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Lathnu Hellion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lathnu+Hellion), because it allows me to win the race against Mardu.
