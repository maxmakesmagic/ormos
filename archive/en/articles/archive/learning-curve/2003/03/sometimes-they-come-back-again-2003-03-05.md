![Whiteout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Whiteout)Like the undead, some of my favorite **Magic** cards come back from the graveyard. One of my all time faves is a card most people have never even heard of: [Whiteout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whiteout) from *Ice Age*. While I have actually used its primary ability to ground a creature with flying in combat, I was originally attracted to this card's ability to return to your hand from your graveyard if you sacrificed a snow-covered land. I tried it in every possible deck that had an ability that required discard. I tried it with [Mesmeric Trance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Trance), which would essentially allow you to sacrifice a land to draw a card, but I never found a deck in which that engine felt right. Shortly after the emergence of a deck known as Bugbind, I finally found a home for the unassuming green instant.

I remember one game where I had no cards in my hand, a [Stormbind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbind) in play, and eight lands on the board. My opponent had not seen the synergy of [Whiteout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whiteout) and [Stormbind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbind) before and assumed I could not deal 12 damage to him before his next turn, when he would assuredly defeat me. I tapped all of my mana and then proceeded to sac a land, returned [Whiteout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whiteout) from my graveyard, used two mana to activate [Stormbind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbind) discarding [Whiteout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whiteout), sac'd another land to return [Whiteout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whiteout). . . I sacrificed four lands and did 8 damage at the end of my turn. I finished him off during my upkeep with my remaining four mana. 

[Shard Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix) is another card that I loved to bring back from my graveyard. I had a monored [Pyromancy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancy) deck that used artifact mana and the underused red enchantment to deal five damage a turn to my opponents. [Squee, Goblin Nabob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squee%2C+Goblin+Nabob) would later return from your graveyard to your hand for free. [Survival of the Fittest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest), [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation), [Meteor Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meteor+Storm). There was no end to the ways in which Squee was -- and continues to be -- abused. 

### Today's Lesson:Abusing cards that come back from the graveyard.

While there have always been cards that come back -- as we have seen above -- and there have always been Zombies -- as we have seen all week -- it seems like it is only with the advent of the "tribal" theme that recursive cards have been members of the undead tribe. While everyone has been all a titter about [Graveborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graveborn+Muse), I wanted to talk about two other Zombies and how you can take advantage of their ability to come back from the dead. 

[Undead Gladiator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Gladiator) turns every card in your deck into a cycling card -- albeit for a total of four mana. While it does not draw you extra cards -- also known as card advantage -- it does allow you to speed through your deck to find the best cards to suit your game situation -- also known as card selection. In the early game, [Undead Gladiator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Gladiator) helps you dig for the cards you need, and in the late game, it turns extra lands into cards. Every once in a while, it even gets in the game to swing for 3 damage. [Undead Gladiator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Gladiator) interacts best with cards that exploit the cycling mechanic. [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift), [Astral Slide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide), and [Invigorating Boon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invigorating+Boon) all combo nicely with the Zombie Barbarian. 

A card that nobody seems to be talking about at all is [Ghastly Remains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Remains). While I have a hard time imagining anyone using its amplify mechanic to make it very big (although I have seen some interesting interactions with [Infernal Caretaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Caretaker) in Limited formats!), I can see it being used and abused in Standard with many of the cards that have been exploited with Squee in the Extended format. 

With [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion), you can draw an extra card a turn for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif). In terms of the generic mana cost it is actually one mana cheaper than [Whispers of the Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispers+of+the+Muse) with buyback. Sure the colored mana cost is pretty intensive. But if you play it in a mostly black deck, it should not be that difficult. You could play with swamps, [Tainted Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Isle)s, and [Underground River](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+River)s. Every land in your deck would produce black, which would allow you to always be able to return [Ghastly Remains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Remains) to your hand while still giving you the blue mana needed to cast [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) and other blue spells. 

[Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation) would be a handy outlet for those extra cards and would also combo nicely with [Ghastly Remains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Remains) without a [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) on the board. Once you have ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) and a [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation) in play you could turn each draw step into a 2/2 Zombie token. I attempted to build a deck with these concepts in mind and came up with the following (as you can see I could not resist the call of the [Graveborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graveborn+Muse) in a Zombie deck):

60 Cards

The deck has not been field-tested much yet, and a number of the cards should probably not max out at four copies. Three may be the right number for [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion), [Ghastly Remains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Remains), and possibly [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). This would allow you to play with three copies of [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and all sorts of good stuff in your sideboard. 

I received more mail last week than for any two previous columns combined. Next week's column will pit man against machine and address a topic that came up more than a few times in my correspondence with readers.
