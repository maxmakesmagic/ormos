In this round, Israeli team Ori Horev, Boaz Havron, Yaniv Perry met the international all-stars Martin Jůza, Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, and Shuhei Nakamura. After starting 0-1-1 into 
the tournament, the latter had won a straight seven matches yesterday to clinch their berth in Day 2. However, now at 7-2-1, they were again facing possible elimination from Top 4 
contention. "Shuhei's 10-0," Jůza admitted. "We're just dragging him down."


In the first pairing to finish, Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa playing blue-white met Boaz Havron playing red-white.

First, Damo da Rosa's [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite) and [Elite Skirmisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Skirmisher) were no match for Havron's Vanguard of 
Brimaz and [Archetype of Courage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype+of+Courage). On top the Vanguard was given [Nyxborn Rollicker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Rollicker), Dragon 
Mantle, and [Ordeal of Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod) in exchange for three 1/1 tokens, and it was soon over.


For the second game Damo da Rosa kept five lands, [Ornitharch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornitharch) and his own [Ordeal of Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod), just to encounter an even more 
aggressive opening from Havron: [Firedrinker Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firedrinker+Satyr), [Akroan Skyguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Skyguard),[Nyxborn Shieldmate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Shieldmate). Damo da Rosa's Voyage's 
End bought some time, but when his first creature, the [Ornitharch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornitharch), was met by [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) and Lightning 
Strike he had fallen way to far behind and never got back into the game.


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa 0-2 Boaz Havron**


Next, Shuhei Nakamura and his black-green deck met Yaniv Perry and his blue-black.


Perry started surprisingly aggressive with [Fleshmad Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshmad+Steed)s, [Blood-Toll Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Toll+Harpy), and [Erebos's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%27s+Emissary), but 
with the help of [Sedge Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedge+Scorpion), [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte), [Bow of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bow+of+Nylea), and [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp), 
Nakamura quickly took over the game and there was no comeback for Perry.

In game two then, it was Nakamura who took the role of aggressor or, more accurately, his [Setessan Oathsworn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Oathsworn) did. It was targeted by Ordeal
 of Erebos (which was [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul)led but still provided two counters), then by [Mortal's Resolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortal%27s+Resolve), then got into a fight 
via [Time to Feed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+to+Feed). The 7/7 Oathsworn went all the way and was joined for the last few steps by [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp).


Thus, Nakamura had just won his eleventh consecutive match.


**(9) Shuhei Nakamura 2-0 Yaniv Perry**


Now it all came down to the pairing of Martin Jůza with red-white versus Ori Horev with green-black.


Jůza started off with [Anax and Cymede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anax+and+Cymede) and [Borderland Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Minotaur) but, facing [Swordwise Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swordwise+Centaur),
[Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), and [Graverobber Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graverobber+Spider), wasn't yet able to get in any damage. He cast [Oreskos Sun Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oreskos+Sun+Guide) 
and [Flamespeaker Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamespeaker+Adept) instead, and attacked with all five of creatures next turn. There were some blocks, Jůza cast Thunderous 
Might on [Anax and Cymede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anax+and+Cymede), Horev responded with [Lash of the Whip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+of+the+Whip), and Jůza in turn responded with 
Battlewise Valor. The end result were two dead creatures and 13 damage for Horev, no losses whatsoever for Jůza. Almost needless to say that Horev did not recover.

The second game was a much longer and drawn-out affair, thanks in no small part to Horev's [Akroan Horse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Horse). Initially, Jůza took a lot of damage from Horev's 
growing army of soldier tokens, partly because his creatures kept dying to things like [Lash of the Whip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+of+the+Whip) and [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock). 
Finally, however, he managed to stabilize with [Stoneshock Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneshock+Giant), [Flamespeaker Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamespeaker+Adept), and Borderland Minotaur, and was able to create 
his own, somewhat larger, tokens via [Hammer of Purphoros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammer+of+Purphoros).


**(18) Martin Jůza 2-0 Ori Horev**
