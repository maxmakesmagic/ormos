Last weekend was the worldwide *Rise of the Eldrazi* Prerelease, which makes *this* weekend the worldwide [*Rise of the Eldrazi* Launch Party](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/release-facts)! All of which makes right now the perfect time to get the scoop on *Rise of the Eldrazi* Sealed Deck from the folks who got first-hand experience at the Prerelease.

>  But what is it that makes Rise Limited so fun? Well, allow me to share a story with you all. My friend Dan was playing a match in which he and his opponent had full and cluttered boards, and the game was more or less at a halt. His opponent had a 15/19 creature among his horde, thanks to an [Eldrazi Conscription](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Conscription). Dan had a [Spawnsire of Ulamog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnsire+of+Ulamog) in play and a ton of "reasonable" men. Eventually, Dan cracked a smile and tapped all of his mana... and dumped five Eldrazi from his sideboard into play.

Matteo Orsini-Jones at Blackborder.com [nicely captured](http://www.blackborder.com/q/node/6759) the excitement of the Prerelease:



>  Everybody loves cracking open packs, and even more so cracking open packs full of cards they've never seen. After so many years of playing I still get a little bit excited inside when prerelease weekend rolls by; my inner child desperate to hear the rustle of some never before seen packs being opened in the hope of getting his hands on a cool new mythic rare.

Rich Hagon, also at StarCityGames.com, [had this to say](http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/eldrazilimited/19197_Removed_From_Game_At_The_Games_Club.html):



>  And now, suddenly, I'm no longer playing Magic. Magic is a game of creatures, and a game of spells. Suddenly, I'm playing this weird game where there's only one relevant thing on the other side of the table, and the entire game is about that one thing. It's [Transcendent Master](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transcendent+Master), which Levels to infinity and beyond, and has a [Warmonger's Chariot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warmonger%27s+Chariot) along for (or providing) the ride. I cast [Nest Invader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), [Nest Invader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), [Emrakul's Hatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%27s+Hatcher), [Stomper Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomper+Cub), [Stomper Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomper+Cub), [Pelakka Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pelakka+Wurm), and more. He gains 11 life a turn from his 11/11 indestructible dude. At one point, I deal him 27, hitting him from 30 to 3, but he always has just enough to carry on attacking. I can see that being utterly dominated from the very beginning could get tiresome quickly, but this experience of one monster ridden all the way to victory is a neat idea, and was an utterly different Sealed experience than I've had before.

Jonathon Loucks of Channelfireball.com went so far as to title his Prerelease report [Opposite Day](http://strategy.channelfireball.com/featured-articles/rogue-report-opposite-day/):



>  I knew something was wrong the moment my first match began. On the draw I led out with [Null Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Null+Champion) into a [Venerated Teacher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerated+Teacher). My opponent responded with ....[Staggershock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Staggershock)! Kablammo! Kazowie! Kill your guy untap kill your other guy WRECK YOU!
