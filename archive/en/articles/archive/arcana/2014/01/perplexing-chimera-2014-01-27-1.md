I have a soft spot for deadly mythological creatures. Dragons, Gorgons, Gargoyles, Manticores, and... Chimeras! Whenever I play a game where I can have a Chimera as a companion I ironically name it "Bellerophon," because, well, [Bellerophon killed the Chimera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellerophon) in Greek mythology. 

 The question is: *What is* a chimera? According to Homer's *Iliad*, the chimera was an immortal creature that could breathe fire, with a lion on the front, a snake in the back, and a goat in the middle. *Theros*'s Chimeras are a bit more... diverse:

| --- | --- |
| Coastline Chimera | Horizon Chimera |



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Prescient Chimera | Spellheart Chimera |

 What do these critters have in common? They all have four legs? Wings? A conglomeration of mismatched parts? This whole thing is just so perplexing! Maybe that's why the *Born of the Gods* contribution to the Chimera subtype is....

> 
> Color: Blue creature  
>  Location: An island temple  
>  Action: Show us a wingless chimera guarding the temple. The unique thing about this chimera is that it is symmetrical and has heads and forelimbs at both ends of its body connected by a shared midsection.  
>  Focus: The chimera.  
>  Mood: Fierce, dangerous, magical, and just as apt to attack one direction as the other.
> 
> 
> 

Hold on thereâ€”it has a head at both ends? That is indeed perplexing! It's hard to see on the card, though, so let's take a closer look:
