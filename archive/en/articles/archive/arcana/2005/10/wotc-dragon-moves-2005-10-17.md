As you've probably read, Wizards of the Coast is moving to a new building this week, so most of **magicthegathering.com** is bringing you classic *Mirage* content while we pack up our computers and move to the new place.

But for today's Arcana, we thought we'd share some photos from July of one particularly sensitive part of the move process: The Dragon.

If you've ever been to the Wizards of the Coast offices, you'd notice the Dragon. It's an enormous crimson-and-copper-scaled beast in a threatening attack posture, suspended in the air above the front reception desk. It's there to say, "Hi, you've come to Wizards of the Coast. We like games here. And if you don't play nice, I'll eat you." It's beloved by each and every employee (well, with the possible exception of some talented folks in our Facilities department who you'll see below), so obviously it had to move along with the company.

Here are some shots we'd like to call, "The Flight of the WotC Dragon Across Lind Avenue."
