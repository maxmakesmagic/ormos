The guild symbols are all over Ravnica. And that means that they're all over *Return to Ravnica*, too! You might see the Azorius symbol being used as handcuffs on an unruly Ogre....

You might see the Rakdos symbol as a hole in a human's chest....

Guildgates, of course, are likely to have the symbol of their guilds....

If you look carefully at a priest's breastplate, you might even see a symbol for a guild that isn't even in *Return to Ravnica*!
