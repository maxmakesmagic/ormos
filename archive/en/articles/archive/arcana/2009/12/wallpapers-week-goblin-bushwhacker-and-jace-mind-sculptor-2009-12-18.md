We're going to end 2009 with a double helping of wallpapers. First, we've got a little something for Goblin Week: Mark Tedin's [Goblin Bushwhacker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bushwhacker) from *Zendikar*.

And now we're going to go in a completely different direction. If you've been following the [*Worldwake* Planeswalker Chase](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/worldwake/planeswalkerchase), you'll recognize this. If you haven't, say hello to Jace, the Mind Sculptor! Enjoy.
