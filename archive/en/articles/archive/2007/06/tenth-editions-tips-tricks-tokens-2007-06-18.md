At [**Magic** Game Day](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday) you'll see that there are sixteen thin, rectangular objects inside every *Tenth Edition* booster pack: fifteen **Magic** cards, and a bonus card.

Some of the bonus cards are informational "tips & tricks" cards that explain more about **Magic.** Some of them spill the beans on some of the combos available in the *Tenth Edition* set.

And still others are all-new token cards with original art by **Magic**'s top artists. Each of these tokens is usable with one or more token-generating cards in the *Tenth* set.

Rip open a booster of *Tenth*, get some black-bordered goodness. Maybe open a tips & tricks card for your buddy who's just learning. And maybe crack a token card for yourself. Will you and your friend have a great time at [**Magic** Game Day](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday)? The odds are excellent.
