Hot off a Top 16 finish at Pro Tour – Chicago last weekend, Hisaya Tanaka is looking to add to his resumé at this Grand Prix. To that end he's brought that Ben Rubin and Brian Kibler special, "Oath of Beasts". His opponent, the less lettered Kiyoshi Sasanuma, is playing the Japanese classic that debuted at Houston: [Draco](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco) Explosion. 

### Game 1

The two matched manlands. Tanaka brought out [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and Sasanuma answered with [Faerie Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave). Tanaka followed up with [Living Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish), and settled on [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) after considering [Dust Bowl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Bowl) and [Gigapede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigapede). He Wasted the Conclave on the following turn, while Sasanuma dug for land. He found [Shivan Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef) only to see Tanaka pull [Dust Bowl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Bowl).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gphir03/a992.jpg)Two turns passed while Sasanuma went through [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) and [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), trying to draw out of his predicament. Tanaka cycled [Krosan Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker) to keep himself in land. He continued to hit with his [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village). Finally Sasanuma started to hit basic lands. Tanaka Tutored up a [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), hoping to shut down a quick win. He aimed for [Erratic Explosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion) and hit, but saw a hand of counters, [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), [Draco](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco) and [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition). He hit for three more and flashed back his Therapy, earning a [Memory Lapse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse).

However, Sasanuma seemed to have enough gas to outrace three damage a turn. At the end of Tanaka's next turn he played [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), taking [Scroll Rack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Rack) over [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) and three lands. He dropped the Rack and passed it back. He fell to four. [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) for [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge)s gave him four more cards. He Racked for the full eight on his turn, drawing exactly what he needed: Two [Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)/[Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice) and two [Erratic Explosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion). He Exploded [Draco](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco) to put Tanaka at two. Tanaka made a Baloth and handed it back, but two [Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)s, appropriately stacked, gave Game 1 to Sasanuma.

Sasanuma 1 – Tanaka 0

### Game 2

Tanaka started things with a second-turn [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). He saw an unexciting hand of [Mystical Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor), [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), and five lands, one of them a [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta). He took the Tutor. However, on his next turn he chose to play [Call of the Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd) rather than [Choke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choke). Sasanuma recycled his hand with [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta). Now he had the tools he needed to get things going.

![Erratic Explosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Erratic+Explosion)He counterspelled Tanaka's attempt to flash the [Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call) back. [Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice) spared him some damage, but Tanaka resolved [Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder). While fronting [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) with his islands, he set up [Dust Bowl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Bowl) to get rid of Tanaka's [Llanowar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Wastes). Another hit brought him lower, but now he was free to [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) for [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) and cast it at end of turn. That meant he could [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) for three and leave a pair of islands up. He stood at three. Tanaka was at seventeen.Tanaka tried [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth), but it fell to [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Sasanuma punished him with [Scroll Rack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Rack), threatening a quick win. He racked for four before handing it back. Tanaka was in a bind. He decided to risk it, ignoring the [Krosan Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation) in his hand in favor of [Living Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death), hoping that Sasanuma didn't have [Draco](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco) sitting near the top of his library. Sasanuma [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)ed, then Exploded for sixteen before turning on his Conclave for the final point.

**Final Result:** Kiyoshi Sasanuma defeats Hisaya Tanaka 2-0
