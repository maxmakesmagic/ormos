Return with us now to the [Wall of Mythic Rares](/en/articles/archive/wall-mythic-rares-2011-03-10), where we watch what happens when the mythic rares of *Zendikar* got thrown up on the wall for all of R&D to see. To see, and to improve!


Today's entrant is [Lorthos, the Tidemaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lorthos%2C+the+Tidemaker), or, as it was known at the time, "Loruthos, the Deeplord."

Loruthos had two things that needed to stay unchanged: it needed to be a Legendary Octopus, and it needed as many eights on it as possible.


### The Notes


As always, the authors of these comments are anonymous. This is partly to protect them and partly because nobody signed their notes anyway.



> NAME = LORTHOS, THE TIDEMAKER




---


> Mana Cost: 4UUUU




---


> Up to 8?




---


> Also, if you choose Loruthos as one of the 8, he can never untap?




---


> Change "8T:" to "5UUU T:" and make it Tap "up to" eight permanents.




---


> Take the "8" off the activation.  
> agree!




---


> ATTACK TRIGGER  
> Now that's appealing!


And here's how the card ended up!
