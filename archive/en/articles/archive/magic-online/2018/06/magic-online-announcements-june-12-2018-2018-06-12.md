Vintage Cube Returns!
---------------------


[Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall), [Demonic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Tutor) . . . no, that's not just a list of absurdly powerful old *Magic* cards (though it's also that). It's a tiny sample of what you can find in the Vintage Cube on *Magic Online*. It's nothing like any other cube out there, and it's overflowing with iconic cards from *Magic*'s entire 25-year history. Draft the super-deck of your dreams.


Vintage Cube runs June 13 through July 5. To see the full card list and the most recent changes, go [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist).


PTQs June 16 and 17
-------------------


It's a double PTQ weekend on *Magic Online*. **Saturday, June 16**, beginning at 7 a.m. PT, the format will be *Dominaria* Sealed Deck. A red or blue PTQ Finals Entry Token is required to join this event. **Sunday, June 17**, beginning at 9 a.m. PT, the format will be Modern. Players may enter with 30 Event Tickets or 300 Play Points. The winner of each event will qualify for Pro Tour *Guilds of Ravnica* this fall.


Learn more about *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifiers [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-pro-tour-qualifiers).


Team Standard Super League Tonight
----------------------------------


The latest offering in our roster of Team Super League shenanigans is Team Standard Super League. The format is a bit different from the "Conqueror" rules used for TMSL and TVSL, but the basics are the same: team-wide deck-building restrictions, rotating players, and weekly elimination tournaments. See what kinds of crazy brews these teams bring to the table in the world of *Dominaria* Standard!


TSSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/).


Team Vintage Super League Thursday
----------------------------------


Get your weekly dose of ridiculously complex, powerful *Magic* every Thursday evening. The team-based deck-building rules and tournament structure make it even more interesting and unpredictable. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy TVSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about *Magic*'s most complicated format!



TVSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/format-details/).
