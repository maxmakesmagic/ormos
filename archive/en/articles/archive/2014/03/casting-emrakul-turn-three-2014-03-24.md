 When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he dreamt of a job making Magic cards—and now as a Magic designer, he's living his dream! Gavin has been writing about Magic since 2005. 






A deck that can cast [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul) by turn three? Not just put on the battlefield, but *cast*, getting the extra turn and everything? As always, Modern is full of exciting surprises—I never thought I'd build a deck that could do *this*!

[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) | Art by Mark Tedin


But let me back up for a moment...


There are so many cards tucked away in the format that every time you dig deep into it you can find an interaction that's just waiting to be taken advantage of. I've said it before and I'll certainly say it again: Modern-focused weeks are some of my favorite ReConstructed articles to write. The number of cool decks you send in is constantly wonderful.


I received a lot of awesome decks this week—and be sure to check out the honorable mentions list at the end to see several fresh bases to build your own decks from. But one deck (quite appropriately) grabbed me and pulled me into its clutches. Check out Kyle Casey's Fist of the Suns deck!

### The Battle Plan


[Fist of Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fist+of+Suns). A little artifact nestled back in *Fifth Dawn* that most people had probably forgotten about. Until recently, I hadn't heard this card mentioned in a very long time.


Normally, paying one mana of any color for a spell is a bit tricky to do and doesn't help you save that much mana. But when the format is Modern and you can use [fetch lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=fetch+lands)-dual land mana bases, and when the card you're trying to cast costs fifteen mana, [Fist of Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fist+of+Suns) becomes a pretty potent option.


What's more is that, unlike many cards that sneak [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul) onto the battlefield, Fist actually lets you cast it! This mean that you do, indeed, get the extra turn and everything. This deck can do it as quickly as turn four—and, as I hinted at earlier, with one tweak I'm going to make, we can get it to turn three. But more on that later.


This deck's primary goal is accelerating out a Fist and then an [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul). So, where to take this deck from here?


Well, the first thing to do is to tighten up all of the pieces. There are some things that have a good start, but could be improved upon. Secondly, as I've said again and again, most good decks are about multiple things—and a secondary plan of attack, as well as some redundancy, could be in order here. Finally, prominent **Magic** streamer Jan van der Vegt (known online as DzyL) [started playing with Fist recently, as well](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=started+playing+with+Fist+recently%2C+as+well), and I want to take a bit of a different route than he did—I don't mind ending up somewhere close to him, but it's not very useful if I just recreate his deck.


Ready? Let's see what [Fist of Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fist+of+Suns) has in store for us!


### Deck Breakdown


Which cards fit this deck well, and which just don't quite fit like a glove? Let's run through the deck card by card to find out.





![Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Birds%20of%20Paradise&options=)


 
This deck's primary game plan is to accelerate into a Fist and slam an [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul)—and Birds does a lot toward that goal. It comes down on the first turn and starts setting everything up for you. This sort of acceleration is the direction Kyle took for his deck—and that's what we'll stick with.






![Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sylvan%20Caryatid&options=)


 
I definitely want another five-color accelerant, and at two mana this is one of the best options. Not only does it provide whatever color I'm in need of, but, unlike a spell, it also blocks well and helps stop some early damage—which is crucial in a deck like this. I'm happy with all four.



![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/rc/2014/rc_wk12_292_eldrazi.jpg)
 


Kyle's decklist features six Eldrazi of all shapes and sizes. Three copies of [It That Betrays](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=It+That+Betrays), followed by one of each of the Eldrazi "titans"—[Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek), [Ulamog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog), and [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul).


When you're cheating cards onto the battlefield, you always want to choose the strongest card. After all, if you're going to circumvent its mana cost and just put it out there, why not have it be as strong as possible? To this end, I want to refine this list. It should definitely start with four copies of [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul): it's the most powerful, and also gives you an extra turn when you cast it so it sort of has an even-better haste.



![Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Emrakul,%20the%20Aeons%20Torn&options=)

 


After that, I think you could look at a lot of options. Kozilek and [Ulamog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog) are certainly reasonable. Something like [Time Stretch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Stretch) or [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum) also isn't crazy: they both create pretty huge swings. Ultimately, though, I'm happy going down the [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) route. While it's not particularly innovative, nor as sweet as [Time Stretch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Stretch), it's just efficient. Casting [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) basically ensures you have a follow-up play. I want three cards to add to my [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul) four-pack, and [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) it is.



![Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Griselbrand&options=)

 





![Fist of Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fist%20of%20Suns&options=)


 
One of the key cards this deck is based around, you definitely don't want to play less than four copies. You want to draw one every game.



However, even with some digging, you won't always necessarily find one easily. I'm always a big fan of having backup combo plans—and this deck has a great one: [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach).


For five mana, you get to get in there and attack straight with [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul) or [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand). Either one of those in the early game should be enough to lock down a victory, excluding perhaps your opponent comboing you out on their turn. Four [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) is where I want to go.





![Chromatic Lantern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Chromatic%20Lantern&options=)


 
The Lantern is a cute way to ensure you always have all the colors you need for your Fist. It makes all of your mana work effortlessly.



However, the downside of Lantern is that it takes time and several card slots in a deck where card slots are very precious. Fortunately, a mana base that works pretty well for all five colors can be constructed pretty easily out of fetchlands and dual lands. Lantern will go—and the mana base will certainly change to support the need for all five colors.





![Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Farseek&options=)


 
I can definitely see wanting another accelerant in this deck to help propel into [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) and Fist. While [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) is a fine candidate with all of the Ravnica dual lands that are going to be added to this deck, I don't think that's really what I want. If I'm going to play another accelerator, I need it to do something else besides just accelerate one mana—Caryatid, for example, blocks as well.



[Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) is one other option—but you may not always have a ton of excess lands. Five mana is kind of this huge push point for this deck. If you can get to five, then you can slam a [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) or pay for a spell through your [Fist of Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fist+of+Suns). It's too bad there's no accelerator that brings us straight from two mana to five mana...


Or is there?


There actually is, and it's one that shines in a fetchland focused mana base. It's time for [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra)!



![Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lotus%20Cobra&options=)

 


While fragile, Cobra is also basically a must-kill. And not only can this help you cast cards like [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) on turn three, but later on it's actually not that unreasonable to use it to help hard-cast [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand). It also helps fix your colors for [Fist of Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fist+of+Suns).


Playing Birds and Cobra opens you up to getting hurt by removal—often in decks like these, you'll see them avoid any removal targets entirely –but if your opponent spends too much time [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)ing your creatures (Pathing them isn't all that effective) then you can just reach five mana the hard way and set up for a game-ending play.


It's possible something like [Pentad Prism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentad+Prism) is better, but I like how Cobra also helps you cast your spells if you haven't assembled your combo yet, whereas Prism makes you lose mana boosts in the future if you spend its counters. It also does the all-important job of actually killing your opponent after a [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach), since there are definitely draws where [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul) sets them back but then they can recover from five life while you do nothing. Four Cobra it is!





![Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Serum%20Visions&options=)


 
I can definitely see wanting another accelerant in this deck to help propel into [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) and Fist. While [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) is a fine candidate with all of the Ravnica dual lands that are going to be added to this deck, I don't think that's really what I want. If I'm going to play another accelerator, I need it to do something else besides just accelerate one mana—Caryatid, for example, blocks as well.



Decks like this are all about assembling combinations of certain cards—and any card that aids that is worth checking out. [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) does that well, helping you to find the specific cards you need. Even with a bunch of fetchlands shuffling the cards you scry away back in, just setting up your next draw step by shoving two cards underneath your deck can be a big deal.


In addition to [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), I'd like another one mana dig spell. The two top contenders for me are [Faithless Looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting) and [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand). They both look at the same number of cards, but Looting also flashes back. Sleight stays at card parity whole Looting immediately puts you down a card (not counting the "card" of flashback"—but with the potential to draw redundant combo pieces, [Faithless Looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting) lets you get rid of cards in your hand that aren't doing a lot which helps nullify that problem. I would give the edge to Looting here.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/rc/2014/rc_wk12_292_spells.jpg)
 


A big question this deck has to ask is if it plans to leave mana untapped, and if it wants reactive spells or any sort of disruption.


Cards like [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), or even potentially something like [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) are nice—but they do require you to leave mana open, which is something I don't predict this deck will be doing a lot of. [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation) is an exception, but it's a pretty frightening card to play with so many Birds in your deck and doesn't work with [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra)'s mana bursts at all.


Looking more at proactive options for disruption/protection, there a few good ones. [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) is actually a pretty reasonable choice—if your opponent fires off all their removal on your Birds and Cobras, then [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) holds off the fort from any quick beatdown while also posing a large threat himself. However, I really want something to help shut off what the opponent is doing.


The cards I ended up with were [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile). This deck is already going to be dealing a ton of damage to yourself, so you don't want to play a full boat of [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)s—but fortunately, with all of the dig spells this deck has, you can find one pretty easily if you think you'll need it. Two Paths help keep the opponent honest and gives decks like [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) a second thought.





![Urban Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Urban%20Evolution&options=)


 
I can definitely see wanting another accelerant in this deck to help propel into [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) and Fist. While [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) is a fine candidate with all of the Ravnica dual lands that are going to be added to this deck, I don't think that's really what I want. If I'm going to play another accelerator, I need it to do something else besides just accelerate one mana—Caryatid, for example, blocks as well.



If you're spending five mana on something in Modern, it has better be really good. [Urban Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urban+Evolution) doesn't really fit that enough. While drawing three cards and playing a land is nice, at five mana it's just way too expensive to consider. These can go.


With all of those changes in mind, that brings the deck to:

As I hinted at the very beginning, this deck is capable of casting [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul) as early as turn three thanks to [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra). (Birds, Cobra, play and crack a fetchland, cast Fist, next turn [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul)) That's hard to do, but even if you "merely" [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) an [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul) on turn five, that should still put most games away.


It can be fragile, and it's possible you want more disruption. As I mentioned earlier, a version that also has an aggressive plan with [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra), and maybe something is something you could consider for a two-pronged attack. If there's a lot of removal around I would consider going the other direction and cutting the Cobras. (Perhaps for [Pentad Prism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentad+Prism).)


In any case, this deck is a blast to play—not many decks can create the kind of draws that this one can. Have fun with it!

### Beginning the Journey


It's hard to believe, but in two short weeks we'll be kicking off *Journey into Nyx* previews! It seems like *Born of the Gods* only just got here, and it's already time to show off the exciting third set in *Theros* block. I can't wait to show you my preview cards!


But until then, since I'll be building with a brand new card you guys haven't seen yet and have no context for, there isn't a deck challenge for this week. But if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to send them my way. You can either post in the forums or send me a tweet and I'll be sure to take a look.


I hope you enjoyed this unique look at Modern! I'll be back next week with something a little special. Until then, have fun casting a turn-three [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul)!
