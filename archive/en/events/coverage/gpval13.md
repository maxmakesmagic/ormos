Grand Prix Valencia 2013
------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpval13/trophy.jpg)I t was an amazing weekend here in sunny Valencia, Spain. Monsters clashed with heroes, Gods bestowed their favors on their devoted followers, and 1,076 players battled for the title of Grand Prix champion. In the end, it was 20-year-old Samuel Marti from Switzerland who defeated all comers and took the title and trophy.


Grand Prix Valencia marked the third time *Theros* Limited was played at the GP level. Since its debut at the beginning of October hundreds of thousands of games of Sealed Deck and Booster Draft had been played all over the world, and this tournament added quite a few more. The format was well-explored even before the event, but players still found ways to improve on established archetypes, to streamline certain strategies, and to combine the various pieces in new and exciting ways.


And *Theros* Limited truly came a long way. A little over two months ago, a deck with several five- and six-mana spells had taken the titleâ€”now it was time for more tempo-oriented decks to shine. Blue-White Heroes was one of them, as piloted by finalist Andrii Gusiev, while Samuel Marti perfected his green-blue strategy. [Vaporkin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) and [Nimbus Naiad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad) were key cards in his decks throughout the weekend and also high picks for many other drafters.


Marti had read the signs and was deservedly crowned champion of Grand Prix Valencia 2013. Congratulations!
