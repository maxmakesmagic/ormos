Before we get into today's Arcana, here's some news: **all of *Scars of Mirrodin*** is now visible on [the Visual Spoiler](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/scarsofmirrodin/spoiler). Every card! Go look at it! Prepare for the Prerelease this weekend!

Okay, assuming that you've come back and you're still interested in a little *Scars of Mirrodin* trivia, here we go. Back in the days of *Mirrodin*, the ur-golems had four mighty towers.
