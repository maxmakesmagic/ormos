November 5, 2014
 











 In four weeks, while you will be reading this column, I'll be deep in the latter half of Day Two for the [2014 World Championship](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-2014-magic-world-championship) in Nice, France. There, [24 of the world's best players](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2014-magic-world-championship-competitors) will be wrapping up their final few rounds of Standard Constructed, after having battled in three rounds of *Vintage Masters* â€”using packs constructed by real cards. And that is after four rounds of Modern the previous day, as well as three rounds of *Khans of Tarkir* Booster Draft earlier in Day Two.




 In four weeks, I also suspect that many of you will be following along at home, as we stream the World Championship as well as the 2014 World *Magic* Cup in their entirety on [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/magic).



You'll be joining us, won't you? After all, both of these events tend to have some of the biggest matches and the most exciting moments. It'll be an incredible five days of coverage.


The World Championship
======================



 The World Championship will take place on December 2, 3, and 7. Coverage will start at 9 a.m. local time (CET), 12 a.m. PT, 3 a.m. ET, 8 a.m. GMT, and will showcase 24 of the world's best *Magic* players as they compete across four different formats and multiple days in hopes of earning a spot on December 7's Top 4 playoff.
