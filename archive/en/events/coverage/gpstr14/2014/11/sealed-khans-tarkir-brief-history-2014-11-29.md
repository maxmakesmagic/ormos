For some people, a format is most interesting when it's first released. Others enjoy it at the very end of the cycle, when the ranks of the cards have been agreed on and the final touches in deck building are what matters. While this is the first European Grand Prix for Khans limited, the format has already been explored at events all over the world.


*Khans of Tarkir* made it's debut at dueling Grand Prix in Shanghai and Orlando on the same weekend in October. People were excited with the new format, morphs were catching people off guard and in the end the Mardu clan took down Orlando, while Abzan claimed Shanghai .After that we delved further into the format in Nashville in November, and last weekend saw Seth Manfield [Trumpet Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trumpet+Blast)ing his way to a third Grand Prix title in in Ottawa, Canada.


Strasbourg marks the first European Grand Prix for Khans limited and it will be interesting to see how the top European pros, along with international superstars on their way tot he World Championship next week will tackle the format.


Will Mardu still be king? Or will Abzan, Temur, Sultai or Jeskai be able to challenge the throne?


Will one of the World Championship competitors bring the trophy along to Nice? Or will one of the World *Magic* Cup team captains have a winner on his team?


Which ever clan and what ever player you are rooting for this weekend. We will keep you updated and bring both interviews and match coverage. On Sunday night we will know, as roughly 2,000 players will be down to one winner. One clan. One King. One Khan.
