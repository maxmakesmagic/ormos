### "About Face" - by Mark L. Gottlieb


You're playing British Prime Minister Tony Blair in a game following an *Onslaught* two-person draft. This turn, Tony drew and played a [Mistform Skyreaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Skyreaver). It is now Tony's combat phase, and he's attacking you with a [Slipstream Eel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slipstream+Eel). You have nothing but a face-down creature in play and a [Biorhythm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm) in your hand. You have only 2 life left, while Tony is at a robust 17. Thanks to an earlier [Information Dealer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Information+Dealer), you know that the top card of your library is a swamp. But don't be discouraged by the situation--you're going to win the game on your next turn! **Figure out what your face-down card must be.**
