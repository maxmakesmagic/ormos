Pro Tours aren't just about the best players in the world battling for a chunk of money, although they are certainly about that as well. These tournaments are also about throwing open the doors on the latest set to celebrate it and giving you, the players, insight into exactly what R&D was aiming for when they created the Pro Tour's namesake set.



Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* was no exception, and the Inside R&D segments offer insight into not only the cards of *Fate Reforged*, but the story, the art, and the journey to making the set a reality.



So for more on the set, the legendary creatures, the mechanics, and the crossroads theme, check out the videos below.
