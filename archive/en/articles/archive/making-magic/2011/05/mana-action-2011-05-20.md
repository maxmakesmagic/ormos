Welcome to Mana Week! This week we're going to be talking about the grease that makes the whole game run. For my column today, I thought I would expand upon a comment I made in an article many moons ago (June 5, 2006, to be exact). The article was called [As Good As It Gets](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr231), and in it I answered the question "Why is **Magic** such a good game?"
