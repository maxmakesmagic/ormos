WTP goes to Madrid for Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*! We explore the two faces of cards that transform, the many faces of a player who transforms. We talk about *Magic*'s flavorful side with competitive players and celebrate the many famous faces in the Top 8! It all adds up to another fun episode of Walking the Planes! Random warning: this video is not safe for people with a fear of mustaches.
