Welcome to another edition of [Sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches:)! It's Gruul Week on magicthegathering.com, so we take this chance to look at a dynamic piece of art on an aggressive bloodthirst creature, [Scab-Clan Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scab-Clan+Mauler). But first, some background on the artist, Liam Sharp.

[Skarrgan Pit-Skulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Skarrgan%2BPit-Skulk)### Artist Portfolio

 Artist [Liam Sharp](http://gathererdev/?first=1&last=100&term=liam+sharp&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&Field_Artist=on&setfilter=Allsets&colorfilter=All&typefilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&printingfilter=on&x=40&y=24) is new to **Magic** illustration, having painted three (all-Gruul) pieces in *Guildpact* -- the Mauler, [Skarrgan Pit-Skulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skarrgan+Pit-Skulk) and [Gruul Scrapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Scrapper). But Liam has a long history of awesome comic-book [illustration](http://www.liam-sharp.ch.vu/), and if he shows up in **Magic**'s future, we know he'll contribute some more great pieces. 

### Art Description

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions given to Liam for [Scab-Clan Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scab-Clan+Mauler):


> 
> *Color: Red/green (R/G guild)  
>  Location: A once-decent neighborhood, soon to be a smoldering wreck  
>  Action: Show a charging "Morlock" rider team (one large guy blind and a smaller guy on top with no legs). Focus: the "Morlock" berserkers  
>  Mood: What's yours is mine. As of now.  
>  This card represents what the Gruul do best: raid and pillage areas of the city for food and resources. And this team is one of the frontline raiders. They should look frenzied and brutal.*
> 
> 
> 
> 

The term "Morlock" here refers to the mutilated members of the Scab Clan -- those who've suffered injuries and even lost limbs to the machinations of other clans. These guys definitely have something to prove.

The next step is for the artist to submit sketches of his or her vision of the art description.

### Sketches

Here's Liam's initial sketch submitted for [Scab-Clan Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scab-Clan+Mauler):

 The art team definitely favored the head-on view of sketch "A" on the left, so Liam submitted this second sketch:

WOW -- that's a piece full of ragin' action and on-rushing power. That's exactly what the art team wanted to see, so they had him submit the full-color final art.

### Final Art

Liam submitted this final art.

 The art team felt that this full-color art actually *lost* some of the power of the sketch -- so incredibly, they made the decision to revert to the sketch for the final version of the card! The second sketch was cleaned up and used on the card as you know it today.

### Finished Card

Here's the card in its final state, as you'll see in booster packs of *Guildpact*. Get ready to bash with a 2-mana 3/3 trampler (with a little help from Liam Sharp) at the [release tournaments](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/release)!
