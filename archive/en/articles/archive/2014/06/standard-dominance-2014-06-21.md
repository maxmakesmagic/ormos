Standard has been the most popular Constructed **Magic** format for a very long time. The format remains accessible for new players and well-supported by tournament organizers. The sheer volume of players that show up to large events, like a Grand Prix, make it difficult for any one player to dominate the format. Nevertheless, sometimes we'll see a player that rises above expectations, repeatedly making a run deep into these massive Standard tournaments. 


Brad Nelson is a superstar of the **Magic** community. Two Pro Tour Top 8s, nine Grand Prix Top 8s, and a Player of the Year title make an impressive resume. Five of Nelson's Grand Prix Top 8s have been accrued in the last six North American Standard Grand Prix events. 


It all started in Grand Prix Minneapolis, where Nelson made it all the way to the finals with a rogue Blue [Grand Architect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect) deck. 


Then came Grand Prix Charleston, where Nelson Top 16ed (after losing his last two matches, when a win in either would have secured him a Top 8 berth) with another rogue strategy, a [Craterhoof Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craterhoof+Behemoth) [Unburial Rites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) combo deck. 


In Grand Prix Atlantic City, Nelson made Top 4 with a deck that combined [Izzet Staticaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Staticaster) with [Nightshade Peddler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightshade+Peddler) to dominate the creature-heavy Standard format of the day. Nelson was unstoppable until he ran into Hexproof, easily his worst matchup. 


His next Standard Grand Prix was Miami, where Nelson made it to the Top 4 with Junk Artistocrats, a strategy that he had been playing with and promoting for well over a month leading up to the event. 


At Grand Prix Louisville, just one week after Top 32ing Pro Tour *Theros*, Brad again made the elmination rounds before losing in the Top 8 to Brian Braun-Duin, both players where piloting identical versions of Black Devotion.
