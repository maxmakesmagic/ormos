Steve Rubin has plenty of company.


The Pro Tour champion took on all comers with Green-White tokens at Pro Tour *Shadows Over Innistrad* in Madrid last week, and unsurprisingly his Green-White deck has been all over the room at Grand Prix Toronto.


Of the top 100 finishers on Day 1, a full 39 of them were playing the Green-White Tokens deck Team Face to Face Games popularized. The resilience provided by [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) and [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar) against control strategies combined with their ability to allow an army to outscale an opponent’s means the deck has game against any opponent it might face, and given that it’s no shock that it was the most popular Day 1 deck.


Behind that came Bant Company with 14 percent of the field. Initially seen as the boogeyman of the format, the best use of the card [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) has been cut back some this week but continues to be a popular choice given its flexibility and the raw power of [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) and [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn).

Another [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) deck came in next, with Black-Green Aristocrats (colloquially, “Cryptocrats”) coming in next with 11 percent of the field. The surviving shell of last season’s [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors) builds, Aristocrats combines armies of small value creatures like [Elvish Visionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) and [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat) with accelerator [Cryptolith Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptolith+Rite) and sacrifice outlets [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) and [Westvale Abbey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Westvale+Abbey) to generate value from the death triggers as well as *very* large creatures.


Mono-White Humans — the premier beatdown deck of the format filled to the brink with 1-drops — was the fourth most populous deck with eight copies. Thalia’s Lieutenant and friends aren’t the dominant force they were a few weeks ago, but there are still plenty of players who opted to go fast this weekend.


After that things open up. Control decks of all flavors are present, and there is a small scattering of Pyromancer’s Goggles or ramps decks as well. All told, there were 16 decks with fewer than three copies making up 28 percent of the Top 100 metagame.
