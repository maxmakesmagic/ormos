Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






 There's an idea, a series of whispers, a line of thought out there that believes Wizards of The Coast has something akin to a vault, filled with any card you can imagine, piled to the sky. Some might even picture us swimming in it, Scrooge McDuck-style, as we happily bathe in [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)es and wantonly use Alpha [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s as play-test cards.




 Sadly for my plans to surround myself with Beta [Mons's Goblin Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mons%27s+Goblin+Raiders), that simply isn't the case. This made recreating a *Vintage Masters* draft—typically an online-only format—something of a challenge. It's one thing to recreate a [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) digitally, but it's another thing entirely to track down enough cards to make even just three pods happen, as we have for the World Championship here in Nice.



To do so, we went to outside sources and asked—pretty please—if we could borrow some of the rarest, most sought after cards on the planet.


And they said yes.



 It wasn't necessarily that simple. *Vintage Masters* is a peculiar and difficult to assemble product in real life for a few reason. The first, obviously, is that the set includes power—[Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), [Mox Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Jet), [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall), and so on—that are certainly difficult to find.




 The second is that there are certain cards that were rarity shifted from old sets that simply don't have many copies in existence, particularly from old Starter and *Portal* sets—sets printed in limited quantities years ago that were aimed at newer players. So [Goblin General](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+General), for example, was shifted down to a common after only seeing print as a rare and uncommon in two older, less widely distributed sets.

 Finally, for ease of play and coverage, every card needed to have the same art across all copies. That meant every [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), every [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach), every [High Tide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide), needed to look exactly the same. Across *Magic*'s long history, that can be a challenge.




 But with these issues tackled and a card source secured, the *Magic Online* team—remember, *Vintage Masters* is a *Magic Online*-only format—randomly created 100 packs of VMA and sent them, spreadsheet style, to Scott Larabee, Organized Play maestro (not his official title) for assembly.





*Behold, *Vintage Masters* in real life!*
