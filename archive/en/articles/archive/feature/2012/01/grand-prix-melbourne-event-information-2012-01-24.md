The 2010 Grand Prix in Sydney stole the crown for biggest Australian Grand Prix and you just know the Melbournians will have something to say about that! After last year’s visit to the Constructed Realm, Limited roars back Down Under with *Innistrad*  Sealed and Booster Draft. With a $30,000 purse and four Pro Tour invites up for grabs you can be sure that competition will be fierce and with the best judges around keeping it fair, it’s going to be a fun time to be playing **Magic**. Running right alongside the Grand Prix is a huge public events schedule—there really is something for everyone at Grand Prix Melbourne! Be part of history—we’ll see you there. 



*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).

* Deck lists are required.
* If product is not stamped or preregistered, deck registration and deck swap will be performed for the Swiss Sealed Deck.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

**Tournament Officials**
  
 The head judge for Grand Prix Melbourne is Nathan Brewer, the scorekeeper is Mark Brown, and the tournament manager is Robert Teirney.

### Artist Information


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmel12/daarken_02.jpg)We are delighted to announce that Daarken will be attending Grand Prix Melbourne. Daarken came into being in a dark, dank basement under the stairs of an abandoned barber college located in the heart of the tenderloin of San Francisco. Occasionally he emerged from his cave to attend classes at the Academy of Art University. His bright, white skin glistened in the sun as he moved from building to building with sketchbook in hand. After graduating in 2004 he spent three long years honing his skill (a.k.a. playing video games) as a freelance artist before moving to Virginia to work for EA Mythic as a concept artist for the video game Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning. To this day Daarken still plays video games, and stuff.
