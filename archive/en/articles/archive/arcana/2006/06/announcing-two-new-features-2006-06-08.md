When is a Thursday not just a Thursday? When it's new feature Thursday! Get ready to count to two—that's right, all the way to the big deuce—because we here at **magicthegathering.com** have two new regular features to announce to expand our site and our focus on the world of **Magic**. 


### New Feature #1: Ask the Pro


[![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_OlivierRuel.jpg)](/en/articles/archive/ask-pro-june-2006-06-01)First, there's the new ["Ask the Pro"](/en/articles/archive/ask-pro-june-2006-06-01) mailbox featuring Olivier Ruel, a five-time Pro Tour Top 8 competitor. Olivier will be sharing his insights regarding life on the Pro Tour, high-level competitive play, world travel, and just about anything else that interests this Level 6 Mage. In case you're wondering if he's qualified to expound on such topics, here's a quick rundown of what Olivier has accomplished in his career—think of it as the Olivier Dossier:


* Level 6 in the Pro Players club
* Runner-up in the 2005 Player of the Year race; currently in second place for 2006
* Five Pro Tour Top 8s, including three in the past two seasons
* Seventeen Grand Prix Top 8s (No. 2 all time), including seven in the past two seasons
* Grand Prix titles from Bilbao (2005), Bologna (2005), Helsinki (2005), and Cannes (1999-2000)
* Elected as the Road Warrior at the 2005 and 2006 **Magic** Invitationals
* $211,895 lifetime **Magic** winnings, behind only Kai Budde and Jon Finkel
* No. 4 on the Lifetime Pro Points list, behind Kai, Jon, and Darwin Kastle

You can find a link to "Ask the Pro" on the right column of the Tournament Center. New questions and answers will be posted every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. So don't delay, [send in your question now](javascript:makeWinXY('/company/emailtoauthor.asp?author=Ask%20the%20Pro',500,455);)!


### New Feature #2: New & Improved Podcast


But that's not all! This weekend, we will also be debuting our *new and improved* **Magic: The Gathering** podcast. Previously the bastion of all things Pro Tour-related, now our monthly podcast will expand to include information about all aspects of the game. 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/tournamentcenter/2006/randy_podcast.jpg)This month, Randy Buehler will be joined by Paul Sottosanti to talk about the [Legends You Decide!](http://www.wizards.com/magic/youdecide_legendsbracket.asp) bracket results, which may start having an impact sooner than you think. 


In addition, he'll be presiding over a *Ravnica* Limited discussion between Potato Nation's Mike Turian and Scott Johns. With Pro Tour-Prague and three Grand Prix in the books – and all of them showing different winning draft strategies – there's plenty of room for debate and strategy tips for all skill levels. If you're thinking about playing in a PTQ this season or the upcoming Limited Champs, you should give it a listen.


Finally, Randy will run down the upcoming events calendar, including a sneak peek at one of the promotional cards for [Limited Champs](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/champs) (June 24).


The file will be available for download Saturday from the front page of **magicthegathering.com**, but you can get it early by subscribing to the podcast via iTunes. To subscribe to the **Magic: The Gathering** podcast, follow these easy steps.
