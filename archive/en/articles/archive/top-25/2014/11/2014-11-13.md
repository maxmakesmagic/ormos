It's a quiet week here at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. With no Grand Prix last weekend, our Top 25 remains in order, but there's every chance of a major shakeup just a few days away, with Grand Prix scheduled both in Europe and North America.


The Spanish capital of Madrid plays host to the Modern format, and the 24 players who will be playing in the World Championship next month will be keeping a very close eye on the impact of *Khans of Tarkir*. As soon as Khans was revealed, the Modern community jumped on the possibilities of [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy), and an utterly filthy combo deck that threatened—threatens?—to dominate the format. However, a very different card has emerged, an "eight mana" spell that "only" draws three cards. In reality, of course, [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) costs rather less than eight mana, and we can expect to see many players choosing a Cruise strategy in Madrid. Likely players from our Top 25 include No. 2 Jérémy Dezani, No. 5 Ivan Floch, and No. 11 Stanislav Cifka. Raphaël Lévy, the current No. 22, will be in Madrid, but not to play—he'll be our resident expert on the video Coverage.


Across the Atlantic, New Jersey will feature Legacy, and it's likely to be a major event. Size estimates vary wildly, but one of the largest-ever Legacy events is assured. Traditionally, Legacy has been a specialist format that plenty of pros profess to be relatively weak in. Will that be enough to put off the Top 25 from taking their chance, or will the likes of No. 1 Owen Turtenwald, No. 3 Shaun McLaren, and No. 4 Reid Duke put their reputations on the line in this fabulous Eternal format?


Join us next week for all the news from both events, as we bring you the latest *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
