The Gräfensteiner brothers have been a mainstay in the German tournament scene, always hovering close to breakout success. Tobias has a second place in GP Lyon 2010 to his name, but Daniel has a Top 8 appearance at Pro Tour San Diego – and had the upper hand in this Nationals so far.


Both players came into the match on 12 points with a 4-1 record.



### Game One



Riffert was on the play and put early pressure on Gräfensteiner, as he deployed an army of blue creatures: [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), [Aven Fleetwing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fleetwing) and [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) were quickly joined by [Jace's Archivist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Archivist). Gräfensteiners red-white deck held his own with [Griffin Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Rider), [Siege Mastodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Mastodon) and [Griffin Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel), but Riffert just kept pouring out blue fliers. [Belltower Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx) was next. Riffert put his [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) to good use.


Both players traded creatures in combat until Riffert tapped out for [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon). Gräfensteiner attacked into the beast, and Riffert, on 14 life, did indeed block with the dragon: He put [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon) in front of a [Siege Mastodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Mastodon), and [Belltower Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx) in front of a bloodthirsted [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre). Maybe he shouldn't have done that, as [Mighty Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap) elevated the Mastodon high enough to kill [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon).


However, Riffert was far ahead in cards. His [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) was working overtime, and he also had [Jace's Archivist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Archivist) that he was using for a net gain of cards. Out of that came a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) for Gräfensteiner's new [Siege Mastodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Mastodon), and [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) gave him even more cards. Though Riffert had run low on life – 7 to Gräfensteiner's 14 – the stream of cards he was getting gave him defensive cards like [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) and [Frost Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath). Gräfensteiner saw himself overwhelmed by card advantage and the opposing blue army and scooped up his cards.

### Game Two



Gräfensteiner chose to play first and kicked off with two [Gideon's Lawkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Lawkeeper) and a [Goblin Arsonist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Arsonist). The Arsonist quickly died attacking, taking Rifferts blocker with it and enabling [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre) to come in with a counter, but the two tappers stayed on board.


While Riffert busied himself with [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) and [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept), Gräfensteiner preferred [Griffin Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Rider) and replaying his [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre). With Riffert already down to 12, the two [Gideon's Lawkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Lawkeeper)had proved quite capable of pushing through damage.


Riffert tried to build a defense with [Jace's Archivist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Archivist) and [Belltower Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx), clogging up the battlefield, and clearing away [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre) with [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) at the end of Gräfensteiner's turn. But even the Archivist could not find Riffert a way to deal with the two tappers which kept Gräfensteiner on a comfortable 20 life. He used the comfortable lead to go on the offensive with [Bonebreaker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonebreaker+Giant) and pumped up [Griffin Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Rider)s. Riffert went to 5 life, but he kept defending bravely, blocking where he could and using [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) to buy him time.


Gräfensteiner had apparently run out of patience, and dropped down a [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon) of his own. Riffert considered his options, but he had no choice but to give up game 2.

### Game Three



Riffert chose to play first and began things with a mulligan, egalizing the ill effects with a first-turn [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and a third-turn [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination). Gräfensteiner was more into permanents, but his early creature was first sent back by a [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) and then by a second one immediately after that. Gräfensteiner had five lands in play and nothing else, and his attempts at [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) and [Peregrine Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Griffin) were both met by [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s. And Riffert attacked constantly.


After stopping Gräfensteiner cold, Riffert now had seven power worth of ceratures to Gräfensteiner's nothing – and [Frost Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath), too, to push aside Gräfensteiners puny defensive line. Riffert dealt another seven damage, taking Gräfensteiner to a precarious 2 life. Then Riffert dropped the bomb, in the form of [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon), and Gräfensteiner could only look on helplessly.


Well, not quite that helpless, as Gräfensteiner fiddled with [Mighty Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap) and [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) shenanigans to deal five damage to Riffert and dispatching the Dragon via [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling). He even managed to stop another attack via blocking and [Chandra's Outrage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage). But with a mere one life left, Gräfensteiner had not enough wiggle room to claw his way out of the hole, and extended the hand.
