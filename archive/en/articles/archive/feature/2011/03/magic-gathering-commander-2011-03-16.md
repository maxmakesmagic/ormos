### Collector's Highlights


***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* will consist of five different 100-card singleton decks, each with a suggested retail price of $29.99. To continue the tradition of oversized cards associated with our multiplayer releases, each deck will also include three premium oversized legendary commander cards that can be used in lieu of the normal versions of the cards (which are also in the deck).


The 51 new cards will be legal in Eternal formats (that's Vintage and Legacy), but they will not be legal in Standard, Extended, or Block Constructed.


The ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* decks will each be three "wedge" colors with corresponding new commanders. "Wedge" is a term we use for three-color combinations consisting of an allied pair and their shared enemy. Examples of famous "wedge" cards are [Lightning Angel](javascript:void()) (

These combinations have been woefully short-supplied on legendary creatures, so each deck contains the corresponding *Planar Chaos* Dragon (such as [Intet, the Dreamer](javascript:void())) as well as two new legendary commanders in those colors, plus oversized foil versions of all three.


***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* decks will be available on **Magic Online**.
