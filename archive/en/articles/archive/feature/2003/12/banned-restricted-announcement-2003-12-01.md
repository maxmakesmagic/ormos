### Explanations in Brief

Here are explanations of the changes from **Magic** R&D:

### Extended Bannings

**[Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb)**  
 Years of watching constructed metagames evolve has taught us that efficient ways to generate fast mana are always a problem. [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) simply adds too much speed to the environment.

**[Goblin Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Recruiter)**  
[Goblin Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Recruiter)'s ability to stack an arbitrarily large portion of your deck allows goblin-based combo decks to kill as early as turn 2. That's too fast for a healthy environment and the Recruiter is one of several casualties of our effort to eliminate realistic turn 2 kills from the environment.

**[Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith)**  
[Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) has to go for essentially the same reasons as [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb). Things happen too quickly when the available mana acceleration cards are this good.

**[Hermit Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermit+Druid)**  
 The current crop of reanimator decks are winning the game by turn 2 and they all depend on dumping their entire library into the graveyard with [Hermit Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermit+Druid). The Druid simply does too much, too fast.

**[Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids)**  
 In our effort to make sure games last more than two or three turns, we felt we needed to get rid of [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) in addition to fast mana and combo enabling cards. [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) effectively ends the game on turn 2 against almost all creature decks, making it essentially impossible to have a healthy environment as long as this card is legal. 

**[Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)**  
[Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) is both a tutor and a mana accelerator, so we've been worried about it for years. The recent release of *Mirrodin* added many powerful artifacts to the environment and put [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) decks over the top (as evidenced by [Pro Tour New Orleans](/en/events/coverage/ptno03)). 

### Type 1 Restrictions

**[Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish)**  
 Most “tutors” are restricted in Type 1 because it defeats the purpose of restricting a card if you can play four copies of an efficient way to go get it. Since the most powerful cards in Type 1 are sorceries ([Yawgmoth's Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Will), [Timetwister](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timetwister), [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance), [Mind Twist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Twist), etc.) it was possible to play the equivalent of four copies of any one of these simple by moving it into your sideboard. Interestingly, [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) was left off the restricted list because the one extra mana combined with the fact that Type 1 has less powerful instants than sorceries means it does not appear to be a problem.

**[Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox)**  
 Time has shown that fast mana is even more powerful in Type 1 than in other formats.

**[Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond)**  
 Some fast mana cards are easier to abuse than others, but recent advances in deck design have shown that even the drawback on [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond) isn't severe enough to balance a zero-mana artifact that gives you three mana.
