The April 6, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 6, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [animal friends](#top25).


Today's Must
============


1. [Twenty Years, Twenty Lessons](http://gdcvault.com/play/1023186/Twenty-Years-Twenty) | Game Developers Conference | Mark Rosewater

The GDC Vault has made Mark Rosewater's recent talk at their latest conference available online to the public. The talk—which covers lessons he's learned over 20 years working on *Magic*, many of which fans of his column will be familiar with—was, by all accounts, wildly popular. And I don't mean all accounts from Mark Rosewater. They had to turn people away. And now you can see what everyone was so excited to hear. It's especially useful if you're into game design. The whole talk runs about an hour, or roughly one lunch break.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [*Magic* Math—*Shadows over Innistrad*](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/magic-math-shadows-over-innistrad/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Last Friday for the April Fools version of this very article, I made a joke about Frank Karsten writing an article on how math solves everything, and then I made a crack that there was something even math couldn't solve. Naturally, Frank [tweeted me a link](https://twitter.com/karsten_frank/status/715984101061353473) to show that math actually could solve that problem.


The point is that Frank Karsten knows math better than most of us will know anything ever, and you would do well to read pretty much anything he writes on the subject. Here he covers such problems as the expected life losses from [Sin Prodder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sin+Prodder) and [Sorin, Grim Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Grim+Nemesis), the number of instants needed for [Thing in the Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice), and how likely you are to hit delirium. These are things most people try and figure out through trial and error. Math is much faster. Math that someone else does? Even faster!


1. [Inside the Deck: *Shadows over Innistrad* Prerelease](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/insidethedeck-040616-inside-the-deck-shadows-over-innistrad-prerelease/) | Gathering Magic | Inside the Deck

Go inside a Prerelease held at Cool Stuff Games in this neat video. Inside the Deck always produces high-quality videos, so if you missed your Prerelease or just want to relive the experience this video will—well, nothing beats the high of a Prerelease, but this is pretty good.


1. [MtA Episode 167: Drafting at Midnight](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-episode-167-drafting-at-midnight/) | Magic the Amateuring | Maria Bartholdi and Meghan Wolff

Midnight drafting brings people together. It's good for the soul. It's less good for sleep, but sleep is for people who don't get to draft a new set. Listen to Meghan and Maria recount their *Shadows over Innistrad* experiences thus far, with a bit of bonus banned and restricted talk thrown in.


1. [Modern Bans and Unbans! Top 10 *Shadows of Innistrad* cards and more—Live!](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/modern-bans-unbans-top-10-shadows-innistrad-cards-live) | Masters of Modern | Alex Kessler and Ben Bateman

There's a lot to talk about when you're a master of Modern. Alex and Ben recount, in a live show (recorded now), the Top 10 cards for Modern in the latest set. Also, banned and restricted something or other.


1. [*Shadows* Set Review, Part 2 and Modern Bannings](http://freshlybrewed.libsyn.com/freshly-brewed-episode-36-shadows-set-review-part-2-and-modern-bannings) | Freshly Brewed | Ali Aintrazi and Frank Lepore

If you missed [Part 1](http://freshlybrewed.libsyn.com/freshly-brewed-episode-35-shadows-set-review-part-1) of the Freshly Brewed review of *Shadows over Innistrad*, well, that's what that link is for. Come for the sweet theme song, stay for two brewers getting creative with the new set. Also, something something bannings.


1. [*Shadows over Innistrad* Flavor Review](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32713_Shadows-Over-Innistrad-Flavor-Review.html) | StarCityGames.com | John Dale Beety

I'm fairly certain John Dale Beety is attempting to poke the bear with the name he keeps calling the Gatewatch, but I'll overlook it this time because the rare flavor review is a gem we must protect. Plus, he goes into a rather lengthy grammar discussion on [Pore Over the Pages](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pore+Over+the+Pages) that warms my editor's heart.


1. New Standard Facebook Stream

Today at 11:30 a.m. we will be hosting a stream [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering). There will be cake. For us. Not for you. Not sure how we'd stream cake. You probably won't even see it. But what you will see is a discussion of the new Standard, the rotation, and answers to a few rules questions.

1. Prereleases Don't Award Pro Points

So nothing changed. Not even a little. Instead, here's a video of [unlikely animal friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrudR-kIB1k).

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Can we stop quoting Efro's article and assuming everyone thinks you're a jerk if you don't concede? This is NOT the prevalent mindset.
> 
> 
>  — Paulo Vitor (@PVDDR) [April 6, 2016](https://twitter.com/PVDDR/status/717524248538058752)

So, the concession/intentional draw conversation came up again after a Reddit thread titled "[In defense of 'No Sir-ing,' or why it is okay to not concede a game of *Magic*](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4dhv60/in_defense_of_no_siring_or_why_it_is_ok_to_not/)" popped up and gained quite a bit of traction. You can see more of Paulo's thoughts on the topic in that very thread. Look for the little ChannelFireball symbol if you want to read more from PVDDR on the topic.


1. > 
> The Legendary Cube is changing to Legacy Cube for the remainder of the run. Details here: <https://t.co/aK36sxeGa0> [#MTGO](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGO?src=hash)
> 
> 
>  — Lee Sharpe (@mtg\_lee) [April 5, 2016](https://twitter.com/mtg_lee/status/717445687672111104)

We made the [announcement yesterday](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-announcements-april-5-2016#item2) that the *Legendary Cube* just wasn't working out this time around and that we would be switching to the popular *Legacy Cube* for the remainder of Cube's time before the *Shadows over Innistrad* set release. The response was mostly along the lines of "[this cube isn't for me](https://twitter.com/meddlingmage/status/717455878207709184)" but "[you should keep experimenting](https://twitter.com/gamingian/status/717446189956726784)." [Some celebrated](https://twitter.com/Grapplingfarang/status/717465949226414080).


So if the *Legendary Cube* wasn't for you, but you enjoy the *Legacy Cube*, the changeover happens today—and might have already happened by the time you read this.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Neo Atarka Red](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/atarka-red-reloaded/)

Not Neo as in The One, Neo as in the new version of that old pain in my life total. Brian DeMars posted this list just the other day, and it looks brutal. Like the type of deck that will be crushing me for months to come.


The formula hasn't changed much, except there are no [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst)s to make [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command) truly terrifying. There are, however, a metric ton of one-drops, plus a few planeswalkers. I plan to die to this very deck early and often as the format opens up.
