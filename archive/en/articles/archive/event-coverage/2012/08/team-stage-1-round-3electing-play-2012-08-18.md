Greece vs. United States (Team Sealed Deck)
-------------------------------------------


[Scotland vs. Poland (Team Constructed)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/wmc12/s2fm1)


This match was more pivotal for the USA than Greece. With a 1–1 finish, USA was definitely through to the Constructed stages with a win, while Greece, having started at 0–2, could not get through under any circumstances. While USA asked for a concession, Greece elected to play the match out, respecting that other teams in the group would suffer in this case.


"We had to ask," smiled Luis Scott-Vargas, who seemed happy with the Greek response and was eager to get the match started.

### Game 1


In Seat A, both players took a mulligan (the Greek A seat having had to do so eight times thus far).


In the center, Brian Kibler, playing a blue-black mill deck, was up against another blue-black deck. Kibler was short on any land but [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), although ultimately this played to his advantage, with a [Mutilate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate) to stop the early Greek rush. Kibler was playing mono-rare control, using Nefarox as his next threat. A [Chronomaton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton) came down as a second threat, but seemed likely not to be necessary, as Nefarox very swiftly took the first game for America.

Joe Pennachio also took his Game 1, with his white-blue deck powering through the Greek white deck. He looked to LSV as he sideboarded.


In Seat A, Alex Binek was a little slower to win his Game 1, but did so in the most decisive fashion. His mono-green deck was up against red-green, but with [Garruk's Packleader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Packleader) and multiple copies of [Duskdale Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskdale+Wurm), Binek had a formidable board.


"What life are you on?"


"20. You have [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) don't you?"


Binek just burst out laughing along with his team, as he cast [Predatory Rampage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predatory+Rampage).


Vangelis Pelekanos looked to the team's fourth man, who was just making the "scoop them up" motion. US National Champion Kibler applauded his input.

### Game 2


Game 2 wasn't quite as rosy for Kibler. He pulled the trigger on [Mutilate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate) to get a two-for-one, only to see back-to-back copies of [Talrand's Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%27s+Invocation) fill the board for Fondas Papadatos. An ever-growing [Chronomaton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton) could not race the Greek air force, meaning that the B seat match would go to a decider.


Kibler 1, Papadatos 1


In Seat A, for the second time in the match, both players took a mulligan. This time, though, it was the Greek player who came powering out of the gates, eventually setting up a situation where, while busily jamming in to the red zone with [Bladetusk Boar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladetusk+Boar), he was able to use [Mwonvoli Beast Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mwonvoli+Beast+Tracker) to find [Elderscale Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elderscale+Wurm). Traditionally a difficult card for mono-green to deal with, this was enough to prompt the scoop from Alex Binek of the USA. Another match would go to a deciding game.

*LSV disapproves!* 
### Game 3


Kibler was not under too much pressure in his final game, getting up to six mana to cast Nefarox, but finding the legend to be stymied by [Essence Scatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter). Meanwhile a [Wind Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wind+Drake) and [Talrand's Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%27s+Invocation) had been waiting to come down. The pressure was now in full effect. A [Wit's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wit%27s+End) from Kibler was hit by [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate).


One plan from Kibler wasn't working, so he went a different way. Two copies of [Mind Sculpt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sculpt) got Fondas low on cards, but he wasn't able to finish the deal before beatdown from the Greek player finished things with a [Tricks of the Trade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tricks+of+the+Trade) to shorten the clock.

*Greek player Vangelis Pelekanos in his match against USA's Alex Binek.* 
Now there was just one match to finish—Alex Binek against Vangelis Pelekanos. By this point Pelekanos was looking light on lands while Binek had a [Duskdale Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskdale+Wurm) among others beating down. While the Greek player had a [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) to buy a turn (presumably sided in as an answer to [Predatory Rampage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predatory+Rampage)), the Americans didn't even need the powerful sorcery to, over a number of turns, seal the deal.


USA defeats Greece two matches to one, locking up their slot in the next phase of the competition.
