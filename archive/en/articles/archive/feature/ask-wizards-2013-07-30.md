Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks!


Wecome to Worlds Week. So as to elicit some questions for Ask Wizards, I turned to Twitter:



We ended up with several fun questions, so I then pestered **Premier Play Manager Rob Teirney** to answer one. Rob (who is from New Zealand by way of Australia, which is important later) provided a bit of levity in his response, so please enjoy! :)

**Q: Being Americans, how hard was it deciding to invite the rest of the world to your World Championship? #seebaseball —Terry P.** 


**A: Rob Teirney, premier play manager:**


Considering Chinese Taipei are the [current World **Magic** Cup champions](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/welcome-world-magic-cup-2012-08-17-0) it is "their" event to lose. :) While the USA is certainly the single biggest **Magic**-playing country, this year's WMC will feature players from seventy-one countries all hoping to be the last team standing at the end of the day. Personally I think Australia and New Zealand are looking pretty good for this one. Or Macedonia.


If you'd like to watch Chinese Taipei's defense of their championship, there will plenty of exciting live coverage later this week. Here are the webcast start times for each day. A complete replay of each day will be streamed starting approximately thirty minutes after the end of the day's live webcast. For those viewers wanting to avoid spoilers, you can access the stream directly at [twitch.tv/magic](/en/events/coverage/pro-tour%E2%80%93amsterdam-standard-qualifier-season-top-8-decklists) or [www.wizards.com/webcast](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/webcast/home) with no risk of seeing the day's results.
