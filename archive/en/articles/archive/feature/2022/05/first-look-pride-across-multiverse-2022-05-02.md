At Wizards, we prioritize inclusion and diversity in our games and our teams and believe that creates a better place for all. This year we are introducing *Pride Across the Multiverse*, a celebration of the LGBTQIA2S+ community's relentless creativity. The cards in this *Secret Lair* drop draw from many experiences, and it is our hope that people find some part of their own unique selves reflected in these cards. 50% of each *Pride Across the Multiverse* purchase will be donated directly to The Trevor Project.


THE TREVOR PROJECT
------------------


[The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) is the world's largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ young people. We believe LGBTQ young people deserve a welcoming, loving world. And we wake up every day dedicated to making that a reality.

A Word from Art Director Stephanie Cheung
=========================================


*"*Pride Across the Multiverse *is a celebration and reflection of how far we've come, what it took to get here, and what still lies ahead. From the start, we wanted this* Secret Lair *to celebrate the LGBTQIA2S+ community's relentless creativity. There was no way this collection of eight cards would represent EVERY aspect of the community, but we wanted to honor the hope and joy found in our multifaceted identities. It is our hope that people find some part of their own unique selves reflected in these cards.* 


*"The team worked incredibly hard to depict characters from across the Multiverse on cards that represent everything from quiet mundane moments to big celebrations while recognizing the ongoing fight for our future. As art director, I wanted to celebrate the wide spectrum of identities and experiences by working with artists to express themselves with their style and unique experiences in these cards. This project was a terrific opportunity to bring in new styles and artists while also giving visibility to the folks who have been painting* Magic: The Gathering *for years! I looked for artists across the spectrum of LGBTQIA2S+ and BIPOC identities; having a breadth of artists is an important part of celebrating the diversity of our community and experiences.* 


*"As a queer Asian American woman, working on this drop was deeply meaningful and a tremendous challenge. This was my first-ever art direction experience, and I am incredibly thankful for the mentorship of Jess Lanzillo and the support from Jontelle Leyson-Smith. I had the immense pleasure of working with an incredibly talented and playful group of people on this project.* 


*"Each card in* Pride Across the Multiverse *tells its own story of love, struggle, resilience, joy, and community. Stories are how we practice hope, and I think it's so important to hope, to really be in the practice of holding fast and remaining true. It is our triumph, and we will shape the future with our ferocious resilience. I am so proud of what we were all able to accomplish in this set and thrilled to accompany you on this journey."*
