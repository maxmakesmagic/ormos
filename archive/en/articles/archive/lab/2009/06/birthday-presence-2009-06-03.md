![](https://web.archive.org/web/20130614114153im_/http://wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl41_wolverCard.jpg)Hello, Johnnies one and all, and welcome back to the Lab. I'm sure that many of you readers out there are anxiously awaiting today's article (just as I hope you do every week, of course) so I'm pleased to end all the dramatic built-up tension about this Magical contest of sorts. That is, after I talk about this week's theme, which, if you haven't been paying attention, is all about Origin Stories. So you've got a couple of paragraphs to go before I blow the lid off of this hopefully fun deck-building exercise.

Until then, I think I will plunge headfirst into this interesting theme, just as I try to do every other week. Hmm ... Origin Stories. I suppose it's vague enough that I could talk about anything to do with either "origins" or "stories." (Preferably both.) How about the riveting story of myself seeing *X-Men Origins: Wolverine* in theaters? First, I paid for my ticket, and then I bought a large popcorn. Then I walked down the aisle and (this is the exciting part) sat in a seat. Finally, I watched two hours of badass mutant action scenes, and then I left to go home.

Wasn't that a good origin story? Oh wait, they have to be about **Magic**, my bad. I can do that. In my very first article on a permanent basis, I gave a quick synopsis of my **Magic** origins, documenting my early love of red, [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare), and combos. There's really not much I could add to that quick summary, but this is Origin Stories Week, so I'll give a little more detail in the form of that beloved literary device, rhetorical questions.
