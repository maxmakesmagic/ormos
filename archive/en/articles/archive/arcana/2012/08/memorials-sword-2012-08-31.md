Hello! We're kind of busy around here, what with all the [Players Championship](/en/events/coverage/watanabe-wins-magic-players-championship) and [guild-choosing in Planeswalker Points](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/210b). And *Return to Ravnica* previews are going to start this weekend at PAX Prime! So today's Arcana is going to be pretty quick. Check out [Akroma's Memorial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Memorial) from ***Magic** 2013* and *Future Sight*.
