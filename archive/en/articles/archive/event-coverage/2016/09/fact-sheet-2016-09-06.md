	+ Team 2, Player C
	+ Team 1, Player B
	+ Team 2, Player A
	+ Team 1, Player C

* Due to the presence of double-faced cards in *Eldritch Moon* and *Shadows over Innistrad* boosters, cards used for the Booster Draft portion of this event will be pre-sleeved. Players are not allowed to remove cards from their sleeves during the draft.
* No communication (verbal or non-verbal) is permitted between team members during the draft.
* After the draft, team members will be located to separate tables to record their draft pools (15 minutes for draft pool registration and verification). After draft pool registration, team members will sit together for deck building (30 minutes for deck building).

* After the semifinals, the Top 2 teams will draft again using the procedure described above.
* Decklists are required


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 5 Swiss rounds and the Top 4 single-elimination playoff.
* All teams with an X-3-0 record (or better) or the top 40 teams – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 4 teams after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff.
* Top 4 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3 per individual match, with no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Only 1 round will be played in the semi-finals and finals.
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the playoff, the players on the team that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 4 playoff match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
