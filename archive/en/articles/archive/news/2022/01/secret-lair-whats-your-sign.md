Introducing *The Astrology Lands*
=================================


*Secret Lair* is showcasing our star signs in 2022 with *The Astrology Lands*!


We'll make a new astrological drop available to preorder every month at [secretlair.wizards.com](https://secretlair.wizards.com/?utm_source=daily_mtg&utm_medium=article_announcement&utm_campaign=astrology-lands-2022). Each drop celebrates a specific astrological sign, and we'll release them according to the corresponding calendar month. Once each drop shows up on the site, it'll stick around for the rest of the year. They'll first be available for preorder, then they'll be available to purchase at a later date while supplies last. If we sell out of any *The Astrology Lands* drops before December 23, 2022, we'll print more to restock, and you'll be able to sign up to be notified when more are available.


Check your star chart and get ready for a year full of astounding basic lands in *Secret Lair*'s *The Astrology Lands*!
