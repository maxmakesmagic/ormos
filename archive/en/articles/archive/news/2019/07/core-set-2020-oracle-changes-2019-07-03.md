We All Scream for Ice Cauldron (Functional)
-------------------------------------------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ice+Cauldron)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cauldron)
Long ago, every card that instructed you to do something with a card in your hand that had certain characteristics was fixed to say that you "may" do that thing. After all, maybe you have no cards that fit the bill—do you have to reveal your hand to your opponent to verify that you really can't do it? Somehow [Ice Cauldron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cauldron) missed out, possibly because no one could stay awake long enough to finish reading the text. For all your sakes, I drank an extra-large coffee and waded in with my red pen. You're welcome.


#### [Ice Cauldron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cauldron) was:


X, T: Put a charge counter on [Ice Cauldron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cauldron) and exile a nonland card from your hand. You may cast that card for as long as it remains exiled. Note the type and amount of mana spent to pay this activation cost. Activate this ability only if there are no charge counters on [Ice Cauldron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cauldron).


T, Remove a charge counter from [Ice Cauldron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cauldron): Add [Ice Cauldron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cauldron)'s last noted type and amount of mana. Spend this mana only to cast the last card exiled with [Ice Cauldron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cauldron).

Spend this mana only to cast the last card exiled with [Ice Cauldron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cauldron).


Many a Treasured Thing (Non-Functional)
---------------------------------------


As you may have noticed on some *Core Set 2020* cards, we're using a new template for a small number of noncreature tokens. So far, that's just Treasure—we'll look at other existing tokens as we print cards that make them. An example of Treasure in action:


#### [Sailor of Means](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sailor+of+Means) was:


When [Sailor of Means](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sailor+of+Means) enters the battlefield, create a colorless Treasure artifact token with "T, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color."


#### New text:


When [Sailor of Means](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sailor+of+Means) enters the battlefield, create a Treasure token. *(It's an artifact with "T, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color.")*


What's in a Name? (Non-Functional)
----------------------------------


Speaking of übertemplating updates and tokens, we've adopted the new template for legendary tokens that first showed up in *Dominaria*. It took a little time to percolate down, and then some more time for a core set to make this update (we didn't want to make it any other time, which unfortunately meant sitting on it longer than we'd have preferred).


#### [Tolsimir Wolfblood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolsimir+Wolfblood) was:


Other green creatures you control get +1/+1.


Other white creatures you control get +1/+1.


T: Create a legendary 2/2 green and white Wolf creature token named Voja.


#### New text:


Other green creatures you control get +1/+1.


Other white creatures you control get +1/+1.


T: Create Voja, a legendary 2/2 green and white Wolf creature token.


Cryptoplasm Conformity (Non-Functional)
---------------------------------------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cryptoplasm)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptoplasm)
When we standardized copy exceptions, [Cryptoplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptoplasm) escaped us by hiding as a porcelain vase. There are no porcelain vases on New Phyrexia (Elesh Norn would feel uneasy about that), so it stuck out like a sore thumb, and now we can fix it.


#### [Cryptoplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptoplasm) was:


At the beginning of your upkeep, you may have [Cryptoplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptoplasm) become a copy of another target creature. If you do, [Cryptoplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptoplasm) gains this ability.


#### New text:


At the beginning of your upkeep, you may have [Cryptoplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptoplasm) become a copy of another target creature, except it has this ability.


Die, Brutal Expulsion, Die (Non-Functional)
-------------------------------------------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Brutal+Expulsion)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Expulsion)
If *War of the Spark* taught us anything, it's that Planeswalkers die. Under the right circumstances, they're like popcorn, especially if they're not named characters. What this means for us is that [Brutal Expulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Expulsion) doesn't need to dance around saying "put into a graveyard" when it can just throw up heavy-metal horns and yell "DIE!"


#### [Brutal Expulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Expulsion) was:


Devoid *(This card has no color.)*


Choose one or both —


• Return target spell or creature to its owner's hand.


• [Brutal Expulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Expulsion) deals 2 damage to target creature or planeswalker. If that permanent would be put into a graveyard this turn, exile it instead.


#### New text:

Dichotomancing the Stone (Non-Functional)
-----------------------------------------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dichotomancy)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dichotomancy)
Similar to my rules change on 701.18g, [Dichotomancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dichotomancy) falls into the camp of "these words sound nice but if you really stop and think about it, it gets kind of weird." In this case, it sounded a lot like the permanents would enter one at a time, sequentially, rather than happily simultaneously, but it was still squiffy and ambiguous. So, while clearing up the search rules, we made this one unambiguously work like its buddies!


#### [Dichotomancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dichotomancy) was:


For each tapped nonland permanent target opponent controls, search that player's library for a card with the same name as that permanent and put it onto the battlefield under your control. Then that player shuffles their library.


Suspend 3—1UU *(Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay 1UU and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)*


#### New text:

Suspend 3—1UU *(Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay 1UU and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)*


Modular Reminder (Non-Functional)
---------------------------------


Here's another candidate for "least meaningful update": Modular's reminder text used a pronominal "this," but we usually don't let "this" stand alone without modifying another noun, like "this creature." I know there are still some counterexamples floating around in Oracle like sunburst's reminder text, but we didn't just print a set with a brand-new sunburst card! Thanks, [Scrapyard Recombiner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapyard+Recombiner).


#### [Arcbound Worker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker) was:


Modular 1 *(This enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it. When it dies, you may put its +1/+1 counters on target artifact creature.)*


#### New text:


Modular 1 *(This creature enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it. When it dies, you may put its +1/+1 counters on target artifact creature.)*
