Big, Bigger, Biggest!

Hello, and welcome back to Uncommon Knowledge! This week's article was inspired by a whirl through the “timeshifted” cards of *Time Spiral*. You see, I was looking through the subset, and noticed that there were a *lot* of large creatures. You know the ones – Krosan Cloudscraper, Akroma, Leviathan – the big ol' fatties from **Magic's** past. And it got me to thinking – which color has had the biggest, largest creatures in **Magic's** history?




![Colossus of Sardia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Colossus%20of%20Sardia&options=)

Well, in order to figure out the answer to this question, I had to set some ground rules. Without defining the question, how could I get to any answers? Here were the parameters I set out with:



1. I was looking for the largest creature from each color, in each set. I defined largest as “the highest combined power and toughness” – this means that a 2/5 creature would be considered larger than a 5/1 creature.
2. Only mono-colored creatures would be considered. I didn't want to create logjams where Sliver Queencounted as the largest creature for black, blue, green, red *and* white in *Stronghold*. Sorry,Autochthon Wurm!
3. I was only looking at sets that were intended for mainstream release and that consisted of a majority non-reprint cards. This excluded all base sets past Alpha/Beta/Unlimited, *Chronicles*, the *Portal* sets, the timeshifted subset of *Time Spiral*, and the Un sets. I've included a glossary of these at the end, but they weren't part of the calculations.
4. In the case of a tie, full points/placement is awarded to both victors. So, if both green and red have a 6/6 creature, and a 6/6 creature would be the largest creature in the set, I gave both red and green credit for having the largest creature in that set.
5. I only counted creatures that were actually creatures. Enchantments or artifacts that could turn into creatures were ignored, as were instants or sorceries that created creatures.
6. Only the base stats of a creature was counted. Technically, Ivy Elemental could be the largest creature in **Magic** – but out of fairness, it's a 0/0 creature for this competition. However, any creatures that come into play with a fixed number of +1/+0, +0/+1 or +1/+1 counters were given full credit.

What did I find? Let's look at the results!


**1st Place: Green**


In a not-quite-shocking finish that comes as a surprise only to the very oblivious, green is the fatty color in **Magic**. In a full 19 out of 41 sets released (nearly one out of every two!), green had the largest creature in the set.


**2nd Place: Red**


Red, the color of dragons and massive elementals, had the largest creature in a **Magic** set eight times. This tied with another color, but red won the tiebreaker by averaging the 2.73rd largest “biggest-creature” in any given set.


**3rd Place: Blue**




![Island Fish Jasconius](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Island%20Fish%20Jasconius&options=)

Known as the color of inefficient creatures and weak kill conditions, blue ended up tying red by having the largest creature in a **Magic** set eight times! Blue ended up with a sub-theme of “large aquatic monsters” back around the time of*Arabian Nights* (see Island Fish Jasconius and Leviathan) and ended up carrying this torch even to modern **Magic** (seeJokulmorder and Grozoth). Blue did finish with a worse average percentage, however, than:



**4th Place: Black**


Black is often though of as a color that has awesomely large creatures, but at a drawback. In fact, black finished ahead of red for average largest-creature finish, but only had the outright largest creature seven times in **Magic's** history.


**5th Place: Artifact**


Artifacts are constructs built by powerful mages and wizards. It's only fitting that the largest creature in a set has been an artifact creature five times. The artifact sets are considered *Antiquities*, *Mirrodin*,*Darksteel* and *Fifth Dawn*. Artifact creatures took the crown in three of those four sets (more on this later.)


**6th Place: White**


Fun fact, and one I didn't expect to see: Did you know that white has never had the largest mono-colored creature in any set in **Magic's** history? In fact, white's had the *second-largest* “biggest creature” in a set only a paltry six times, making its second best just about worst than most other color's best biggest guys! Maybe R&D will be showing white some large-sized lovin' in an upcoming expansion, hmmmmmmm?

### Fun Facts and Trivia:




![force of nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=force%20of%20nature&options=)

**Alpha/Beta/Unlimited**: It's only fitting that Force of Naturewas the largest creature out of the gate for **Magic**. When I started this article, I half-expected blue to overtake green, given the prevalence of large blue fatties like Leviathan andPolar Kraken. Boy, was I wrong.



***Arabian Nights***: However, Island Fish Jasconius quickly established that sometimes blue would be given some large aquatic thing with which to rule the lands, seas, and board. Many think of Juzam Djinn as the flagship “fatty” out of*Arabian Nights*, but it's a full creature smaller than the Island Fish. This would also be one of only two times that the largest creature in a set had a higher toughness than power (the other is Aku Djinn from *Visions*).


***Antiquities***: The first set in which an artifact was the largest creature, and frankly I'm surprised there haven't been more “biggest-creature” artifact creatures. They *are*, after all, the constructs of wizards. Shouldn't they be building bigger and better?


In addition, each color only received seven cards in *Antiquities* (not counting, of course, Artifacts and Lands). This made for some truly pathetic “largest creatures,” including Atog (1/2) and Sage of Lat-Nam (1/2).


***Legends***: After finishing in second for the first three releases in **Magic**, black's “creature with a drawback” fatty finally makes good (Cosmic Horror), although it is equaled by the five Elder Dragon Legends (Palladia-Mors, Chromium, Arcades Sabboth, Nicol Bolas, and Vaevictis Asmadi).


***The Dark***: Most think of Leviathan as the first true blue über-fatty, even though it probably wasIsland Fish Jasconius. There's just something more impressive about a 10/10 trampler than about a 6/8 Islandhome dude. White begins a long descent into weenie-fatty hell, with its largest creature topping out at a paltry 2/2.


***Fallen Empires***: *Fallen Empires* was the first set in which more than one color shared the title for largest creature in a set – Orgg and Deep Spawn both finished in first. This was also the first **Magic** set in history to not include an artifact creature at all. There would be eight sets total on this list that were sans artifact creature.




![Polar Kraken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Polar%20Kraken&options=)

***Ice Age***: If you may have noticed, literally every “largest creature” from Alpha through *Weatherlight* has a drawback. Some are minor (such as Orgg's attacking and blocking restrictions) and some are major (Force of Nature's  ![Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150515165945im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150515165945im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150515165945im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150515165945im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif) or take 8 damage upkeep cost). Polar Kraken, though larger thanLeviathan, probably has a less extreme drawback.



***Homelands***: Memo to white: Your fatties suck if you're getting your head beaten in by Ebony Rhino. Note that I chose to use Abbey Gargoyles for my chart below, and not the 2/5Hazduhr the Abbot.


***Alliances***: Green had the largest creature in Alpha/Beta/Unlimited…and then stopped having the largest creature in a set until Gargantuan Gorilla in *Alliances*. Technically, Lord of Tresserhorn ties the Gorilla for largest creature, but he's gold and doesn't count. White's largest creature weighs in a 1/6 (Kjeldoran Home Guard).


***Mirage***: Phyrexian Dreadnought is the answer to several trivia questions, including “Which creature has the lowest mana-cost to power/toughness ratio in **Magic**, for creatures that cost more than zero to cast?” It's also the largest creature in **Magic** for nearly a decade after this point.


***Visions***: Artifact creatures tend to either float towards the top or the bottom of the stack when compared to the size of other creatures in a set. In *Mirage*, artifacts had the largest creature (Phyrexian Dreadnought). In *Visions* and *Weatherlight*, it has the smallest “largest creature” (Matopi Golem andSteel Golem).


***Weatherlight***: Green begins an unparalleled streak of seven straight sets where it has the largest creature – Aboroth, Verdant Force, Carnassid, Spike Hatcher, Endless Wurm, Yavimaya Wurm, andThorn Elemental.




![Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Verdant%20Force&options=)

***Tempest***: Verdant Force marked the first time in which the largest creature in a set was also one without a drawback. I didn't expect to find this fact out, and was one of the most surprising on this list. I guess early developers thought that a high power/toughness and mana cost should automagically (yes, that's a word) equal drawbacks.



***Stronghold***: Technically, Sliver Queen is the largest creature in *Stronghold*. Even more technically, Shifting Wall can be larger.


***Exodus***: The first set in which the largest creature (Spike Hatcher) was a 0/0 creature that comes into play with +1/+1 counters. This wouldn't happen again until nearly a decade later, in *Saviors of Kamigawa* (Sekki, Season's Guide).


***Urza's Saga***: This was white's chance to steal the show withSerra Avatar, but \*/\* creatures don't count. Sorry white, you're just a chump when it comes to the largest creature in any given set!


***Urza's Legacy***: There have been only two sets in **Magic's** entire history where the largest creature in the set wasn't a rare. Yavimaya Wurm/*Urza's Legacy* is one. Can you guess the other before it comes up? (Hint: An Uncommon has never been the largest creature in a set.)


***Urza's Destiny***: Thorn Elemental is a likely candidate for largest creature in *Urza's Destiny*, given that it replaced trample and Force of Nature for a couple of base sets in Standard. Bonus White fun fact: Still stuck with 1/5 creatures as your largest guy, White? Some things never change!


***Mercadian Masques***: Even though *Mercadian Masques* block is viewed as a down point for power level, the average size of the largest creature actually reaches a peak between blocks, thanks to the Timmy stylings of the Avatar cycle in *Prophecy* and the tops of the Rebel/Mercenary Chains in *Masques*itself.


***Nemesis***: Skyshroud Behemoth sets a new bar for the size of green fatties. Silkenfist Order keeps the bar lowered for the title of “largest white creature in a set” at 3/5.


***Prophecy***: The Avatar cycle propels White to near the top, thanks to the 4/9 Avatar of Hope. It's also the first and only time that a complete cycle of creatures takes the top spot for “largest creature of its color” in a set.


***Invasion***: Several colors would have loved to use their Elder Dragons here (Rith anyone?), but instead they are stuck with Djinns.




![Draco](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Draco&options=)

***Planeshift***: Draco tops off the list not only as the largest creature in *Planeshift*, but as the highst mana-cost creature in**Magic**. This record still stands, excluding Un sets. White's largest creature? The 2/2 Voice of All.



***Apocalypse***: Should Penumbra Wurm count as a 12/12, since you get it twice? Note that even though Green has the largest creature in a set 19 times, only around a third of them have trample!


***Odyssey***: Most would argue, successfully, that the largest creature in *Odyssey* is Psychatog.


***Torment***: In the first intentionally color-skewed set (There were one too many red uncommons accidentally printed in Revised, and one too few green uncommons – here's looking at you, Shatterstorm!), it's fitting that Hypnox is the largest creature.


***Judgment***: And in the white/green set, the largest mono-color creature is the 7/7 combo-machine engine, Worldgorger Dragon. Go white!


***Onslaught***: Green dominates the tribally-themed *Onslaught* block by taking the largest creature slot in each and every set.


***Legions***: It's surprising that there are this many fatties in *Legions*, despite it being an all-creatures set, because one of the main mechanics was amplify, which lends itself to giving creatures a low base power/toughness.


***Scourge***: And the only other non-rare creature to be the largest creature in a set? It's Wirewood Guardian, which ties with Dragon Tyrant as the largest creature in *Scourge*.


***Mirrodin***: The *Mirrodin* Block is the first official “artifact block,” and it's fitting that Leveler is the largest creature in the set. This is followed by…




![Darksteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Darksteel%20Colossus&options=)

***Darksteel***: Which introduces Darksteel Colossus, which is pretty much the fatty by which all other fatties are measured at this point. Darksteel Colossus, unlike previous “largest creatures” on this list, ends up seeing play in a myriad of tournament decks, including tons of Vintage-legal Tinker builds and Tooth and Nail.



***Fifth Dawn***: You'd figure that Wizards would finish out the artifact block by having another artifact creature as the largest creature in the set, but the 5/5 Razormane Masticore is only good enough for *last* place, tied with (wait for it) white'sBringer of the White Dawn.


***Champions of Kamigawa***: Another really interesting fact I didn't expect to find: Every rare creature in *Kamigawa* block is Legendary, and Kuro, Pitlord is the first legendary creature which is the largest creature in a set! It took over a decade of**Magic** until Wizards made a legendary creature the fattiest fatty, which is truly incredible given that legendary status indicates a unique being of immense power and historical importance.


***Betrayers of Kamigawa***: Although this legendary creature thing continued into the next couple of sets, Patron of the Orochi didn't seem too legendary.


***Saviors of Kamigawa***: White can't even muster a legendary creature in this set, and ends up with the smallest “largest creature” in any set in the *Kamigawa* Block (the 3/4 Eiganjo Free-Riders).




![Jokulmorder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jokulmorder&options=)

***Ravnica***: After a long absence, the return of the “blue monstrous sea-fatty with a drawback” returns with Grozoth, although Autochthon Wurm is technically the largest creature in the set (sorry, white!).



***Guildpact***: *Guildpact* marks the only time in **Magic's** history where green has the smallest “largest creature” in a set, although I'm sure that Bioplasm gets larger than 4/4 over half of the time.


***Dissension***: After two straight sets of blue on top, green returns to form with Protean Hulk, edging out (narrowly) the 5/5 defender from white, Stoic Ephemera.


***Coldsnap***: Jokulmorder is big. That is all.


***Time Spiral***: In the nostalgia set, it's only fitting that the largest creature is green, the smallest “largest” non-artifact creature is white, and all is good in the world.


That's all the time and space I have for you this week at Uncommon Knowledge! Be sure to check out the chart at the bottom of this article for further reference, and tune in next week as I explore the history of zero-mana cost creatures and spells in a world of storm!
