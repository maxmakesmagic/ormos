Sunday, 3:00 p.m. – Decks Out of the Ordinary
=============================================

Several interesting decks have stood out among the usual suspects here in Prague. One of them was in the hands of Spaniard Pere Llimos, currently living in Copenhagen, where he and Dane Michael Fromberg fine tuned a deck built around not only Goryo's [Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeance) and [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand), but also [Necrotic Ooze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrotic+Ooze), who can mimic the [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) if there is one in the Graveyard, allowing for some crazy turns.


“When you cast [Necrotic Ooze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrotic+Ooze) with a [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) in the graveyard you instantly win, by drawing cards, and setting up a kill with multiple [Soul Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Spike)s,” Llimos explains.



The deck has a Jund-ish shell that allows it to play a control role against decks like Affinity, that aren't that well suited for the late game. Against those kind of decks the combo isn't even always necessary, according to Peres Llimos.

*Spaniard Pere Llimos*
“The deck runs eight removal spells in [Lightning Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe) and [Soul Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Spike), which allows you both to take care of opposing [Deathrite Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman)s and being able to control the board against aggro decks,” he says.



Another giant Legendary Creature also stands out in his decklist – [Borborygmos Enraged](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borborygmos%C2%A0Enraged).


“What the story with [Borborygmos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borborygmos) is? Well, he was in the deck we found and tuned, and he often acts as both a [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God)-effect on your opponent's board, as well as drawing you a few lands when you put him into play with Goryo's [Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeance). Also it allows you to win by discarding lands you draw from [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand)'s effect,” explains Llimos.



Although not at the top of the standings, both Llimos and Fromberg made day two with the deck, and looking back he doesn't regret his choice of deck. “It is very good, especially since very few people tend to play with [Rest in Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace) now, which is a card I've lost to today. The only change I would make to the deck is to add a Zombie [Infest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest)ation, to be able to do more with the cards you get to draw from [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand)”.

### Red Blue Delver


Another sweet deck was Martijn van der Vaart's Red Blue Delver, which had him battling at the top tables almost until the end of the day.

Finally one that surely raised a few eyebrows on unsuspecting opponents was German Richard Berze's Green/Blue deck built around [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) and [Time Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk)-effects. Although he lost his last round on Day One, barely missing Day Two, we thought we'd honor his creation by showing his innovative decklist.
