Flavor Text Week spurred a lot of debate about the place of literature in **Magic**, but the intellectual first love of most of the people behind Magic is math. Richard Garfield has a Ph.D. in combinational mathematics and several member of R&D have similar math backgrounds.

So it should be no surprise that mathematical ideas find their way onto cards.

### Möbius strip

The Möbius strip is the simplest geometric shape which has only one surface and only one edge. It can be created by taking a strip of paper, giving it a half twist along its long axis, and then joining the two narrow ends together. The Möbius strip was anagrammed into the card [Bosium Strip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Bosium%2BStrip) in *Weatherlight*.

### Klein bottle

A Klein bottle is a topological space, named for the German mathematician Felix Klein. The surface is not constructible in three-dimensional Euclidean space but has interesting properties, such as being one-sided, like the Möbius strip; being closed, yet having no "inside" like a torus or a sphere; and resulting in two Möbius strips if properly cut in two.

By intersecting surfaces, a close approximation to the "real" 4-D Klein bottle can be made in 3-D space. This 3-D representation is what is found on the card [Elkin Bottle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elkin+Bottle) from Ice Age, the name of which is another crafty anagram.
