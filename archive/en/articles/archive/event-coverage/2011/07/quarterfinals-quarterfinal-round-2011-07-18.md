We're going to keep an eye on all the quarterfinal action as it happens, but we begin with Shouta Yasooka's quest for Player of the Year, a title he last won in 2006. He brings his Tezzeret deck into action against Tomoya Fujimoto, who is really living the dream this weekend, since he won the Last Chance Qualifier on Friday. He brings an interesting green-white deck, but it may not be seen to best advantage here against the might of Yasooka.

*Shouta Yasooka, left, vs. Tomoya Fujimoto.* |



Yasooka opened the top 8 with a turn two [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb), by which time [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) had been the perfect opening for Fujimoto. His turn two was a second [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and [Nest Invader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader). [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) allowed Yasooka to strip [Blade Splicer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+Splicer) from Fujimoto's hand, before Yasooka added [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb), gearing up to kill [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) the following turn.


Fujimoto cast [Hero of Bladehold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold), then passed. As expected, Yasooka ticked up the [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb), blew it to kill both [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), then cast [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas) before turning his [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) into a 5/5. Fujimoto piled into the red zone, sending [Nest Invader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), [Hero of Bladehold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold), and the two bonus Soldiers that came with the Hero.


Tezzeret fell to dead, as did the [Hero of Bladehold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold), and Yasooka fell to thirteen. He laid a second [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), taking him to five mana, and passed the turn with his 5/5 [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) his only board presence.

*Shouta Yasooka* |



Fujimoto had [Journey to Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) for the Orb, and crashed in with two Soldiers and [Nest Invader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), with Yasooka now at nine. He tapped out for [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), which was enough to have Fujimoto simply lay a land and pass. [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) attacked unmolested, taking Yasooka back to thirteen. He used one of his [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge)s to kill [Stirring Wildwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood), and went back to beating with [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) when Fujimoto had no play.


Yasooka used his four mana to cast [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) for two, which left Fujimoto a window to cast [Acidic Slime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime), destroying the [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull).

*Tomoya Fujimoto* |



Yasooka used his [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) to cast [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx), two words that are never a good sign for an opponent. [Black Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) for two wiped the board except for the giant flying card advantage machine, and Yasooka completed a great turn with [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), sending the planeswalker to five loyalty. [Journey to Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) replied from Fujimoto, taking out the [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx), but the card advantage had found Yasooka his new *M12* kill card, [Sorin's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%27s+Vengeance).


**Yasooka 1 - 0 Fujimoto**


In the Valakut mirror match, it looked as if Makihito Mihara was taking control of game one. He had [Avenger of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar) on the battlefield with seven plants for support, together with [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya), which may be quite good together...On the other side of the table Kouei Itou had just a pair of [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum).

*Kouei Itou vs. Makihito Mihara* |



Meanwhile, Yoshihiko Ikawa led Ryoichi Tamada by a lightning-fast 2-0, his [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) deck piling past the Valakut player, despite an eleven card sideboard package to swing the matchup back towards Tamada. In game three, however, Ikawa mulliganed to five, which was hardly promising.


Tamada opened with Valakut, but despite a double mulligan Ikawa had plenty of thinking to do about his turn one. He laid [Glacial Fortress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Fortress) tapped and cast [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) for free. [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) from Tamada led to [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) and a second [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle). [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) from Ikawa revealed [Seachrome Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast) and [Origin Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin+Spellbomb), which he unsurprisingly sent away, picking up [Signal Pest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) from the top. [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) attacked for the first damage, Ikawa laid a second land, and was done. Most definitely not the explosive starts of the first two games, but that's what happens when you mulligan to five.

*Ryoichi Tamada* |



Tamada laid [Khalni Heart Expedition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Heart+Expedition) and a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to begin his quest to up the [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s count, while Ikawa tapped out for [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) before attacking for three with his lonely [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite). Tamada had [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) for a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). In came the [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) again, with Ikawa laying [Signal Pest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest), still holding two cards in hand. Tamada, though, had four. The first was [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), the next [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine), the next a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and the next [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim), taking out [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel).

*Yoshihiko Ikawa vs. Ryoichi Tamada* |



Ikawa attacked for two, with Tamada down to eleven. [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) cleared the board, and Tamada felt confident enough to activate his [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) and pile in. That was the cue for Ikawa to sweep up his permanents, completing a comprehensive misfire that made the score..


**Tamada 1 - 2 Ikawa**



### Score updates from the other quarterfinals



Fujimoto had managed to equalize againt Yasooka, making them now a best two out of three. Ryuuichirou Ishida had taken his [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) deck to a 2-0 lead over the Blue-Black Control of Shouta Takao, while Makihito Mihara had indeed taken the opening game of the Valakut mirror, and led 1-0.


Ikawa opened with [Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) in game four, paying two life via Phyrexian mana. It attacked on turn two, followed up by [Glint Hawk Idol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol). Tamada added to his [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) with a second copy, and passed. [Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) activated the [Glint Hawk Idol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) before Ikawa cast [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel), crashing in for seven damage. [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) took out the [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel), which was precisely what Tamada needed to stay in contention. Ikawa cast [Origin Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin+Spellbomb) with his [Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal), activated his [Glint Hawk Idol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol), and attacked. The card he drew with [Origin Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin+Spellbomb) still didn't net him a third land, and the pair of [Hero of Bladehold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) he was holding were stuck there, worthless in his hand.


Still, Tamada was down to seven, and needed something more heavy-duty than [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim). Something like [Creeping Corrosion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Corrosion), for example, which he promptly cast. Ikawa attempted to reload with two [Signal Pest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest)s, but the sideboard of Tamada arrived again when he cast [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) to wipe the board again. When Tamada tapped six mana for [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), Ikawa conceded, and we were heading for a very brisk game five shootout.


**Ikawa 2 - 2 Tamada**


Fujimoto now led Shouta Yasooka by 2-1, and was looking to cause an upset. It looked as if the [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) deck of Ryuuichirou Ishida was going to sweep the blue-black Control of Shouta Takao, while the Valakut mirror was still in the early stages of game two, so there's a good chance you'll be reading about that one in about three paragraphs from now....


Ikawa kept his opening seven, and so did Tamada, a bad sign for Ikawa, who opened with [Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge). [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) on turn two saw [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and [Signal Pest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) on top, which Ikawa sent away, getting a land instead.


[Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) attacked for one, with [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) the turn two land from Ikawa. Tamada sacrificed [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) for a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and spent turn two on [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle).


Ikawa landed [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) and attacked for three with his [Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge).



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/qf_ikawa.jpg)

Tamada used his three mana to [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate), adding a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to the board, and a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) to hand, which he cast as his land for the turn, leaving [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) mana open. The [Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) attacked for another three, and Ikawa dropped [Hero of Bladehold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold), apparently for the first time in the whole match, since Tamada wanted to check what the card did, Ikawa playing with an English version of the card...


Tamada reached six mana, and then moments later eight, which meant [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan). That had been the cue for the concession in game four, but not this time. Tamada was at thirteen and Ikawa had a possibly awesome turn coming. He opened with [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), seeing [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and [Glint Hawk Idol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol), leaving them on top, and drawing the [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite). He cast it, and used [Dispatch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispatch) to kill the [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), now that he had Metalcraft. In came the [Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge), the [Hero of Bladehold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold), and two Soldiers, and now Tamada was at just two life.


The Valakut player untapped with eight mana, but basically needed [Creeping Corrosion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Corrosion) AND [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) on this one turn if he was going to survive. Or, a LOT of red-hot Valakut action.Ikawa sat motionless as he waited to discover his fate. Tamada cast [Khalni Heart Expedition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Heart+Expedition).


He cast [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate), but Ikawa had a card waiting - [Unified Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unified+Will)!


Now THAT's why you play blue boys and girls...


During the final game here, two of the other quarterfinals reached their conclusion. As expected, Ishida took the third game and the sweep over blue-black, while Tomoya Fujimoto completed an excellent victory over Shouta Yasooka.


**Ikawa 3 - 2 Tamada**


**Ishida 3 - 0 Takao**


And you know what? That Valakut mirror was done too, and that could mean only one thing - a clean sweep for Makihito Mihara!


So, in a little less than an hour all four quarterfinals were done.


Ikawa had managed to squeeze past Tamada in a really tight five game set. He would now take his [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) deck into action against the green-white deck of Tomoya Fujimoto, who had taken out Shouta Yasooka by 3-1. In the bottom bracket, Ryuuichirou Ishida, on the back of his 3-0 quarterfinal win over Shouta Takao, would face the Valakut deck of Makihito Mihara, himself a 3-0 quarterfinal winner.


Steel against green-white.


Steel against Valakut.


Who would prove their metal mettle in the semifinals?
