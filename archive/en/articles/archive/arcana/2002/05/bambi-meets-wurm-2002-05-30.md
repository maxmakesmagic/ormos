Humor has its place in **Magic** -- just look at all the squirrel cards in *Odyssey*. But some cards are supposed to represent the "baddest of the bad" and are not really meant to be humorous.


The Wurm Token from the [Player Rewards](/en/articles/archive/player-rewards-tokens-2002-05-27) program is one such bad-ass card. Huge 6/6 creatures are no laughing matter, so when artist Alan Pollack made a reference to "Bambie Meets Godzilla," a cult favorite animated short made by Marv Newland in 1969, in the wurm artwork, the brand team made the tough decision to edit it out in the final card.


Leave the jokes to the squirrels.
