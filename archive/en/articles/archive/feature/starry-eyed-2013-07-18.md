Yo yo yo, I'mma let you finish. But Ajani has the best team uniform of this core set. What, you don't believe me? Check this out. [Ajani's Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Chosen) is a new rare in ***Magic** 2014* and they have the coolest team uniforms yet.

Â 

In the art description, the creative team describes "a group of 3 leonin warriors who have been enchanted with white magic." And "[e]ach of them has a symbolic mark of facepaint that slashes down over their left eye, that mimics Ajani's eye scar. Their claws glow with white magic, as if they've dipped their forearms in pure sunlight."


I love the idea of Ajani's pride of Leonin warriors wearing a painted scar over their eye in his honor or as a marker for their allegiance. And then on top of that, presumably, he does something magically to enchant their limbs and make them sunshine-y.


Best. Team. Uniform. Ever.
