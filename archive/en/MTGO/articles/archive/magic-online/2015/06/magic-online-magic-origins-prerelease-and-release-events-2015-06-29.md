**Ignite Your Spark**


Experience the epic origin stories of *Magic*'s most iconic Planeswalker characters. Start your own *Magic* journey and ignite your spark with the world's best strategy game.


**Prerelease Events—Friday, July 24-Monday, July 27**


* [Swiss Draft](#preswissdraft)
* [Friendly Sealed](#friendlysealed)
* [Competitive Sealed](#competitivesealed)

*Magic Origins* Prerelease events kick off Friday, July 24, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific (UTC-7) on *Magic Online*. Start by drafting your way through the backstory of your favorite Planeswalkers in the [Prerelease Swiss Draft](#preswissdraft). Not only is the Prerelease Draft the only way to try out *Magic Origins* in a Draft during the Prerelease, it's also the only way to pick up the Jace, Vryn's Prodigy Avatar for your collection.


If it's Sealed that you're after, head over to the *Magic Online* Store and pick up your favorite Planeswalker's "Origin" Entry Object. Join a Prerelease Sealed Event using the "Origin" object and get six *Magic Origins* booster packs, plus a seeded booster that aligns with your chosen "Origin."


Each seed booster contains seven cards, including a premium rare or mythic rare and a run of commons and uncommons, all sharing the color of the seed booster.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Origin Item | Seed Booster |
| 
 Gideon Jura's Origin | White Seed Booster
 (Contents listed above) |
| 
 Jace Beleren's Origin | Blue Seed Booster
 (Contents listed above) |
| 
 Liliana, Vess's Origin | Black Seed Booster
 (Contents listed above) |
| 
 Chandra Nalaar's Origin | Red Seed Booster
 (Contents listed above) |
| 
 Nissa Revane's Origin | Green Seed Booster
 (Contents listed above) |

There are two types of Prerelease Sealed Events for aspiring Planeswalkers to take part in: [Competitive](#competitivesealed) and [Friendly](#friendlysealed). The Friendly Sealed Event is for those whose main goal is to check out the new set and start your *Magic Origins* collection. The Prerelease Competitive Sealed Event features a steeper prize curve and QPs for placing highly. Whichever you choose, you'll get a Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh Avatar just for participating! Make sure you get the Jace and Chandra Avatars while you have the chance, because they won't be available after Release Events begin on July 27.


**Release Events—Monday, July 27-Wednesday, August 12**


* [4-3-2-2 Single Elimination Draft](#4322draft)
* [8-4 Single Elimination Draft](#84draft)
* [Pack Per Win Swiss Draft](#ppwdraft)
* [Release Swiss Sealed](#releasesealed)
* [64-Player Single Elimination Draft, with Top 8](#64playerdraft)
* [Swiss Sealed, with Top 8](#swisssealed)

Release Events begin at 10:00 a.m. Pacific (UTC-7) on Monday, July 27 and run through the Wednesday, August 12, downtime.


For Draft fans, the [Pack-per-Win Swiss Draft](#ppwdraft) makes its triumphant return and runs alongside the [8-4](#84draft) and [4-3-2-2](#4322draft) Single Elimination Drafts in the Limited Queues Room. Try out any of the three and you'll get the Nissa, Vastwood Seer Avatar just for participating. Once you have a feel for the set, raise the stakes with the *Magic Origins* Release [64-Player Single Elimination Event](#64playerdraft), and get the Liliana, Heretical Healer Avatar while you're at it.


Prefer Sealed? Try out the [Release Swiss Sealed](#releasesealed) and get the Kytheon, Hero of Akros Avatar—that's the only place you'll be able to earn it throughout Release Events. If you're looking for the biggest Sealed Event with the largest prize pool, mark your calendar for the [Release *Magic Origins* Swiss Sealed](#swisssealed). It runs in the Scheduled Events Room, and includes a Top 8 Draft. Participation in that event is one of two ways to get the Liliana, Heretical Healer Avatar.


Whether this set marks the beginning of your *Magic* origin story or you're already a seasoned Planeswalker, have fun and good luck on your journey!
