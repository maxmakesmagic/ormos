It's time to show more *Shards of Alara* tokens. You saw [yesterday's set](/en/articles/archive/shards-alara-tokens-2008-09-30), right? If you didn't, you should go look at them. And be amazed!

Okay, hit it!

This Thopter token indicates that a [Sharding Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sharding+Sphinx) has recently dealt combat damage to someone.

The [Archdemon of Unx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archdemon+of+Unx) is well known for producing two things: delicious baked goods and 2/2 Zombie tokens.

The Goblin token does not have haste, so it must come from [Dragon Fodder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Fodder). However, you could probably use it for [Goblin Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Assault) in a pinch.

Ah, the [Ooze Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ooze+Garden) in action is a beautiful thing, isn't it? Gross, but beautiful.

Saprolings are a common feature of Jund. They're often seen is association with [Jund Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jund+Battlemage), [Mycoloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mycoloth), [Necrogenesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogenesis), and [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax).

But tokens aren't the only extras that come in packs. You might also get this *Conflux* promotion:
