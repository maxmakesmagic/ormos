Dave Humpherys v. Nicolas Labarre
---------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob04/r9fm1_1.jpg)This season, France has truly shined in the realm of constructed. At Pro Tour New Orleans, it was the French [Goblin Charbelcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher)/Mana Severance "Clock" deck that was the most successful, putting three of its players into the Top 8. Two of those competitors were Gabriel Nassif, and Nicolas Labarre. The French haven't disappointed once again, as many are playing a [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) deck that generated quite a bit of buzz yesterday. Using mana acceleration and land tutors for [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s, the deck can cast [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) to get board dominating creatures like [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) and [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) into play, or can simply hard-cast them from the hand. Nassif is playing the deck this weekend, while Labarre is running the more typical Affinity deck. Both players come into this round at 6-2, and are looking for a win to bring them one step closer to another constructed Pro Tour Top 8.


### Game 1


Labarre took a mulligan, and after he kept his six land hand, Nassif took one as well. Labarre played a first turn [Arcbound Worker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker), and a Stinger on turn two. The weenie assault continued, as Labarre animated a [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus), played [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) for free, and attacked with his team. [Oxidize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) killed the Nexus, and Nassif took two damage. Labarre had one Nexus left, and it attacked on the following turn as Nassif was lacking any early resistance. He played [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) on turn four, which was promptly killed with [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt). This cleared the way for another attack, dealing five more damage to Nassif. He played a second Simulacrum, and it blocked [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) while Nassif's Nexus traded with Labarre's. This left the Stinger and the Worker as the only creatures on the table, while Nassif was at five.


[Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) with entwine took out Labarre's [Glimmervoid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmervoid), and got a second [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) into play. Labarre's attack brought Nassif to three, and Nassif played and activated [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver). Labarre didn't have anything in hand to cause some damage to the board, so Nassif just made him tap out. He then took his next turn and played [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) with entwine, putting [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) and [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) into play. Labarre played another Stinger and a Disciple and ended his turn. Nassif activated [Stalking Stones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones) and sent it into the Red Zone, along with the Colossus and Angel. Labarre blocked with his weenies and made a Stinger 3/3, and Nassif used [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) and [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) to get two more [Stalking Stones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones) into play. Labarre summoned a Ravager, which combined with the Disciple to give him a combo kill and then some, but it was no good as long as the Angel was out. Nassif summoned [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman), and Labarre quickly conceded.

### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob04/r9fm1_2.jpg)Labarre had a rough start on this one, as he had to mulligan down to four. He still managed to have a second turn [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite), but it died to [Oxidize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize). Nassif played [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) set to one, and started to accelerate with [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying), getting [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost). Labarre had a Stinger in the air, and used [Dismantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismantle) to destroy the Chalice, putting the counter on his Stinger and getting a big laugh out of the crowd. Another Scrying put a second [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) into play, and [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) with entwine got a third. [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) followed, putting [Leonin Abunas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Abunas) and [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) into play. There was enough mana left to kill Labarre's [Vault of Whispers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+of+Whispers) with [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow), leaving him with one land in play. He played a [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus), and ended his turn. Nassif cast a second [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail), getting two [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman)s, and Labarre conceded.
