The goal of The Lexicon is to teach players the meanings of some of the more obscure words we use in card names. While many of the offbeat names (like "[Ridged Kusite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ridged%2BKusite)") are simply made up, we often dig around dictionaries for real little-used and archaic words for inspiration. Check out these Lexicon entries drawn from *Planar Chaos* cards.
