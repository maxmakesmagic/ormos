The Grand Mana Tour
===================



 Posted in **savor the flavor**

In **Magic**, lands—places, environments, terrains—are the ultimate source of mana. The type of terrain determines the color of mana they generate. I wanted to show off some of this mana generation in action by stepping out my door, but from my desk at Wizards of the Coast I can only see a little courtyard and a concrete parking lot. I think I can only generate, like, dishwater gray mana around here.
