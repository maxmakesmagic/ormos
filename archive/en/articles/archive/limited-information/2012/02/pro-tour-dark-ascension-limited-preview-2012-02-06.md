Beginning with Pro Tour *Dark Ascension* in Honolulu, Pro Tours are going to be tied to the release of expansions (but not Core Sets). Every expansion gets its corresponding Pro Tour two weeks after its Prerelease.

Given how little time there is between the release of *Dark Ascension* and Pro Tour *Dark Ascension* in Honolulu, the world's top players will, by necessity, be playing with less practice than they would like to have—particularly in Limited.

But even though we don't know exactly what Draft decks are going to dominate this weekend, doesn't mean we don't have a clue of what to look for...

Rise of the Werewolves?
When *Innistrad* first hit the streets, Red-Green Werewolves seemed like it was poised to become one of the top Draft archetypes in the format. As people continued playing the format, though, it became clear that dedicated Werewolf decks just weren't good enough to cut it (barring exceptional circumstances).

But while many established archetypes are getting weaker, now that they have one fewer pack to pick up their signature cards, Red-Green Werewolves seems to be getting stronger.

I know they might not look like much, but [Hinterland Hermit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinterland+Hermit) and [Scorned Villager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scorned+Villager) are actually going to be big boons for the deck—as Werewolf players will now be able to reliably fill out the early spots in their curves with Werewolves.
