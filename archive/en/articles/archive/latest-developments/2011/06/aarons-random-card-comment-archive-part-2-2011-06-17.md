Aaron's Random Card Comment Archive, Part 2

By Aaron Forsythe












*Director of **Magic** R&D Aaron Forsythe is consistently active in the online **Magic** community, primarily through his Twitter account, @[mtgaaron](http://twitter.com/#!/mtgaaron). One occasional feature on his Twitter feed is Aaron's Random Card Comment of the Day, or #arccd. For each Random Card Comment, Aaron uses the [Random Card](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?action=random) button in Gatherer, then heads into the Discussion tab for that card and writes a short commentary on it—no matter what it is (except for basic lands, as discussed in ARCCD #16).*


*The result is something like 30,000 words—and counting—of candid card commentary from a man who's spent more time thinking about **Magic** than can comfortably be guessed. Inside, you'll get Aaron's thoughts, insights, and recollections about "perfect" cards, the difference between design and just making cards, and the switch from [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) to [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel).*


*Here, collected in one place for the first time, are Aaron's Random Card Comments numbers 26-50. We're divvying them up for your protection—if you've ever tried to drink out of a firehose you know what I'm talking about—but if you really want to dive in, you can find our archive of the first 25 [here](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/aarons-random-card-comment-archive-part-1-2011-06-03).*


*Tom LaPille will be back next week!*
