Former GB National Champion Jonathan Randle had a mixed 2010. At Nationals last year he made it to the final four, only to be left on the outside looking in, first losing his semifinal, and then the 3rd/4th-placed playoff. That's the not-so-good. Nonetheless, it still won him a trip to Worlds in Chiba, and he really made it count there, going all the way to the Top 8 before losing out in a nail-biter against Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa of Brazil.


Now he's back in the Nationals fray, and sitting happily on table one heading into the draft. [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider)got the ball rolling, with only a [Frost Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath) disturbing a run of green cards early in the draft that included [Jade Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jade+Mage) and two [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). [Hunter's Insight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunter%27s+Insight) and a second [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) came seventh and eighth, with that second pick [Frost Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath) the only real move away from mono-Green.

*The bigwigs at draft table 1.* |



He could have continued that theme in pack two by taking [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web), but couldn't resist the appeal of [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter). That made his next pick tougher, however, as another [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) was the alternative to [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer). Had he still been completely open, that [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) might have been the cue to head into red. As it was, the Looter was a strong-ish commitment into definitely going Blue-Green.   

After serious deliberation, he took the [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) anyway. [Cudgel Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cudgel+Troll) was next, with more Green flowing from his left. He also took a couple of [Alluring Siren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren). Not exciting, but adding to the list of blue cards he might play.


Pack three opened with another big choice, or perhaps more accurately a big gamble. His blue commitment stood at one [Frost Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath), one [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), and two [Alluring Siren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren). Not disastrous, but not fabulous either. There was a second Looter available in the opening pack, opposite [Sorin Markov](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov). Now Sorin is a huge commitment, but with a potentially huge payoff, and it wasn't as if Randle had many bombs to that point. Nonetheless, he decided on the second Looter, and presumably made a Black mage further round the table very, very happy.


There was a possible third [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) in the next pack, but the lure of a 5/5 dragon for four mana, even with an illusionary drawback, was too much, and [Phantasmal Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Dragon) joined the pile. Then it was largely back to Green, with two [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion)s among the better cards.


After the draft, we talked through some of the key moments with Randle:


**There's a belief that green is underdrafted/unpopular. How do you see it?**


Yes, it is largely underdrafted. To be honest, I don't like it very much, but I spent a couple of days with Marco and Matteo Orsini Jones and former National Champion Dan Gardner. Dan was playing Magic Online for something like fourteen hours straight, and he was winning a ton of 8-4 queues with green.

*Randle ponders his options.* |



**You took a couple of [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). How important is acceleration in the format?**


I'll take [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) over most things. I was hoping to get more four and five-drops to make them better. The format as a whole is faster than M11, but I don't think it's quite as fast as some people are implying. Either way, though, acceleration is necessary in your green deck.


**You considered [Hunter's Insight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunter%27s+Insight) whenever you saw it. How highly do you rate it?**


I like it a lot, but I only took one. The other two occasions, I really needed more three drops for turn two after a [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) start, so I took other cards. I still like the Insight, though, very much.


**Tell us about that [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) pick at the start of pack two.**


Dan had a lot of Magic Online success with green-blue decks that were big guys and as many [Frost Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath)s as you could get. I only ended up with one, but I love Looter. Decks like this don't have many tricks or removal, so it's important to grind through your lands with Looters if you can.


**Then you saw the [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer)...**


Yeah. The Lavamancer is pretty bad in a green deck, but two things made me take it. First, I thought it was possible that red was going to open up, and also it's the kind of card that can be so good in an opposing deck. Either way, I felt I couldn't just ignore it.


**Those [Alluring Siren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren)s, are they good for you?**


They work really well with [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider)s. It's good against the Bloodthirst black-red decks, but it works pretty well against the cheap blue-white flyers deck too.


**You had the chance to switch into black with [Sorin Markov](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov). Why didn't you?**


It seemed as if black was quite open, so I did consider it. But [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) is very, very good, and I already had one. To pass up the certainty of two [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) for a gamble on triple black for Sorin didn't seem a gamble worth taking.


**Finally, it looked as if you picked up plenty of useful sideboard cards. Is that something you concentrate on?**


I think it's part of the format in general. There are cards out there that are going to be useful, and it's important that you take them. I always like to have one [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) in my sideboard for something like [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control), or maybe a [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) if they have [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun). You don't maindeck cards like that, but it's good to have at least the chance of an answer if they have one of those power cards.
