The cream has risen from the crop of Day 2 decks, and once again Modern proves to be the format where a thousand flowers bloom. Looking at the eighteen decks at the Top 9 tables, those players still in the hunt for the Top 8, we see a whopping ten archetypes represented. It may be irresponsible to draw conclusions from such a small sample, but I’m not about to let that stop me.



Twin and Abzan continue to headline the format, with five and four decks apiece. The other three major players in the post-PT format – Affinity, Burn, and Infect – can only boast a single entrant. Perhaps these are the glass cannons, too easily hated out of contention now that they’re known and expected?



The next most significant aspect is that both of the players on Amulet Bloom combo who made Day 2 are still in contention. It’s a complicated deck to be sure, but its raw power is hard to deny. Will we see more players turning to this archetype, or will the high barrier to entry keep it a dark horse?



Wrapping things up is a rogue’s gallery of singles: White Weenie, Hexproof, Merfolk and Grixis Delver. Could one of them be the deck that topples the Abzan/Twin oligarchy? Just two rounds will give us our Top 8!
