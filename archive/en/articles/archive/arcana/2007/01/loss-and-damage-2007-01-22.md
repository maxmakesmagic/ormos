You know from cards like [Worship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship) that damage is not exactly the same in **Magic** as losing life. At 1 life with [Worship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship) and a durable creature in play, you know to fear no [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)s to the face or enemy [Grizzly Bears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears) on the rampage (thanks, classic example cards!).


But damage and loss of life are related. Any time you take damage, you lose life -- a rule that matters in several situations, and for a couple of cards in particular that care about amounts of life lost.



![Children of Korlis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Children+of+Korlis)

The ability of [Children of Korlis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Children+of+Korlis), from *Time Spiral*, allows you to recoup a bunch of lost life -- and it doesn't specify "damage" you've taken this turn. It *implies* that it works for damage you've taken by its wording (and that reminder text helps). It would be quite a different card if it only worked for cards like [Soul Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Feast)!


That "damage causes loss of life" reminder text has appeared on only one other card. It's another card that would function very differently if it only cared about non-damage life loss.



![Lich's Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lich%27s+Tomb)

This floating metal coffin from *Darksteel* effectively turns your permanents into a pseudo-life total, triggering whenever you lose life. But damage causes loss of life, so you can't ignore those [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)s and rampaging [Grizzly Bears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears) with the Tomb in play -- sorry, Lich fans!
