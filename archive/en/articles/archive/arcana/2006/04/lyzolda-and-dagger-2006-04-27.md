Each Ravnica Block guild has a legendary guild leader (e.g. [Razia, Boros Archangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razia%2C+Boros+Archangel), [Ghost Council of Orzhova](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Council+of+Orzhova)) and a legendary "guild champion" (e.g. [Agrus Kos, Wojek Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agrus+Kos%2C+Wojek+Veteran), [Teysa, Orzhov Scion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teysa%2C+Orzhov+Scion)). Each "champion" has abilities that combine well with one color of its guild, and combines even better with cards of both colors. The Rakdos guild champion follows suit here:


![Lyzolda, the Blood Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lyzolda%2C+the+Blood+Witch)
**[Lyzolda, the Blood Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lyzolda%2C+the+Blood+Witch)**, high priestess of the cult of the demon [Rakdos the Defiler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Rakdos%2Bthe%2BDefiler), parted ways with her sanity long ago. Now she embraces the Rakdos "philosophy" (if you can call it that) of gleeful destruction. She leads Rakdos gatherings that are half demented variety show, half bloody mass sacrifice -- and cackles all the way.


Jim Nelson's art of Lyzolda depicts her embrace of the demonic forces of guild Rakdos. Note the hints of her insanity in the slicing scars across her eyes and mouth, and the fact that she's reaching out to touch streams of -- lava? The wicked throng around her is also indicative of the company she keeps, even if they're about to be sacrificed.

And what insane priestess of demonic destruction is complete without her gruesome dagger of ritual sacrifice? Hey, wait a minute:


![Rakdos Riteknife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rakdos+Riteknife)
And look who appears in the art of the Riteknife (which is, not-so-coincidentally, also illustrated by Jim Nelson):

Lyzolda also appears [on the packaging](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1066_LyzoldaBooster.jpg) of some *Dissension* boosters.
