Although it's already round 4, this will be the first time that Fabian Dickmann and Fabrizio Anteri will be playing today. Both veterans started the day with 3 byes; in Anteri's case, he locked up Gold after a very successful last season.


Anteri decided to try his luck with the Jund Planewalker archetype that proved most successful during the Constructed rounds of last weekend's Pro Tour. Dickmann on the other hand went with Green–White Aggro.




*Fabian Dickmann wanted to add another great result to his resume this weekend!*
