 Patrick Chapin has been around **Magic**: the Gathering for a long time, longer than most people playing today. Finding his first success on the now defunct Juniors circuit, the Hall of Famer's first Pro Tour Top 8 came at Pro Tour New York in 1997. His second came two years later in Los Angeles.



Since then, he's picked up two more Top 8s and a handful of Top 16s on his way to becoming one of the best known and longest-lasting players and writers in the game. He's the rare kind of player who somehow has more Pro Tour Top 8s than Grand Prix Top 8s because he spends so much of his time dedicated to focusing on only the highest levels. With his legacy secured and his ticket punched to the Pro Tour for all time, Chapin has just one thing on his mind: winning his first Pro Tour.



 He's come close before. A second place at Worlds in 2007 when he broke the format with [Dragonstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstorm) was the nearest he came to calling himself a Pro Tour Champion. Until now. Doing so would not only let him check that off his bucket list, but would also qualify him for the World Championship, something he says is his dream.




 Standing in his way is a start that's shooting to the top about as quickly as possible. Nam Sung Wook has Top 8'd two Grand Prix this year, including a win in Melbourne. He's also the current leader in the **Magic Online** Player of the Year race. Add in his appearance in the finals this weekend, his membership on Team MTG Mind Card, and his status as the only South Korean player ever to make a Pro Tour Top 8, and it's clear we have a player whose stock is on the rise.






*Hall of Famer Patrick Chapin and Nam Sung Wook may have been sporting the same colors for their Constructed decks, but the two went down different paths in how they built their deck. Would Chapin's midrange strategy earn him his World Championship slot, or would Nam look to the stars and lock up a win in South Korea's first Pro Tour top 8 with constellation effects?*
