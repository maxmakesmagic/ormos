By Blake Rasmussen and Alison Luhrs











We've spent the last four weeks talking about *Commander (2017 Edition)*, but we're switching gears this week to prepare for *Ixalan*. Next Wednesday the first *Ixalan* story will run on DailyMTG, but in the meantime we're going to dip our toes into the world of Ixalan before we plant our boots there.


Also, since people requested it, our good friend and community member Cary Thomas ([@Vronos](https://twitter.com/Vronos)) took it upon themself to transcribe the episode, which [you can read here](https://vronos.com/magic-story-podcast-transcripts/magic-story-podcast-ixalan/). Of course, then you're missing out on the dulcet tones of our voices, but, hey, you do you.
