Three years ago, Kei Umehara made his first Top 8 at Grand Prix Yokohama. Today, marks his second Top 8 appearance and Temur Delver was his weapon of choice. Clearly, [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose) and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) had served him well and was worth the green splash.


His opponent was not a slouch either, having broke into the Top 8 in the first seed out of 1942 other competitors. Kazuya Murakami's Blue White Miracles homebrew that he has christened "Counter Top Mentor" was aptly named. He was playing with 4 copies of [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor), the [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) on steroids.


Game One
========


Murakami received the right to play first. After a mulligan, he tried to resolve a pair of [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance), but both were hit by [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare).

[Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) appeared on Turn 3, only for it fall to [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares). Umehara let out a wail when Murakami drew into his third [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance). With no threats on the board, Umehara would need to try to force one into play.


[Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) was countered by the [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) sitting atop his deck. Umehara had to settle for [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose), the very last card in his hand. However, that was quickly outclassed by [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) and [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) and Umehara reached for his sideboard.

Game Two
========


Murakami had to go down to six cards again and quickly faced pressure from an opposing [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets). It fell to [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) after three attacks as a Human Wizard and one attack as an Human Insect. Ouch.



 Umehawa replaced it with [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose), which got in for three more unimpeded attacks, putting Murakami at a dangerously low life. More ouch.




 When Murakami tapped out for [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor), it provided a window for Umehara to resolve [Vendillion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendillion+Clique). With [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) removed, [Vendillion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendillion+Clique) was able to sneak in for the lethal blow.

Game Three
==========


Umehara's first move was to counter the opposing [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) with [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare), before baiting out some countermagic and removal spells for his [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets).


That enabled Umehara to resolve [Vendillion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendillion+Clique) once again, and Murakami could only let it resolve, revealing a hand of [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), and [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor).


However, that was the turning point of the game. Feeling that he could win the damage race, he chose to remove [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top). That turned out to be a grave mistake, as Umehara later admitted.


Naturally, Murakami put [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor) into play, and outraced Umehara with a bunch of Monk tokens and prowess triggers.
