Reiji Andou drafted a Blue/Black deck featuring some quick creatures like [Organ Grinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Organ+Grinder), removal and tempo cards like [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst), [Churning Eddy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Churning+Eddy), [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) and [Waste Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waste+Away), and one bomb, [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). Marco Blume drafted a Black/Red deck with [Kamahl, Pit Fighter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Pit+Fighter), [Pardic Arsonist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Arsonist), two [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher)s, and two [Whispering Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Shade)s, although the quality of his cards dropped off dramatically afterwards. He was forced to include two [Earth Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earth+Rift)s in the deck, presumably the last two cards to make the deck.

When asked before the match who he thought would win, Marco Blume responded that it was a fairly even match and it could go either way.

Reiji Andou won the die roll and chose to play first.

### Game 1

Both players began the game by playing two Swamps on their first two turns. On Marco Blume's second turn, after playing the Swamp, he had to make a crucial decision. His hand contained both [Mesmeric Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) and [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood), as well as [Whispering Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Shade), [Earth Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earth+Rift), a Swamp and two Mountains. If he played the [Mesmeric Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) and attempted to use it to gain tempo advantage, it would likely negate the usefulness of the [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) for the rest of the game. On the other hand, if he waited an additional turn or two to see if his opponent would play a creature first, he might miss out on taking advantage of a potential bad draw on his opponent's part. After a small amount of deliberation, Marco Blume cast the [Mesmeric Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend), allowing him to see the contents of Andou's hand: Swamp, [Organ Grinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Organ+Grinder), [Gravegouger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravegouger), [Churning Eddy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Churning+Eddy), [Ghostly Wings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Wings), and [Waste Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waste+Away). He chose to lock up the [Organ Grinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Organ+Grinder) and Andou responded on the third turn by laying a Swamp and casting the [Gravegouger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravegouger). Soon, Andou was attacking with a 3/3 flying [Gravegouger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravegouger) (thanks to Ghostly Wings) and Marco was hoping to draw an answer to it, seemingly unwilling to use [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) and return the [Organ Grinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Organ+Grinder) to his opponent's hand.

For the rest of the game, Marco Blume failed to draw much of anything besides an inconsequential [Halberdier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halberdier) and lands. Reiji Andou eventually got additional creatures into play which protected the 3/3 flier from [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) and Marco Blume lost the life race.

Andou 1, Blume 0

### Game 2

Marco Blume chose to play first in this game. Marco's opening hand was Swamp, Swamp, [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher), [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor), [Earth Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earth+Rift), [Pardic Arsonist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Arsonist), and [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger). He thought for a long time about whether to mulligan or not, repeatedly picking up and putting down his hand, stroking his chin, staring up into the rafters. After several minutes, he decided to keep the hand, believing that if he drew two lands in the next three or four turns, he would likely win the game.

Unfortunately for Marco Blume, the lands didn't come. On his fourth turn, still with only two Swamps in play, Marco was forced to begin discarding and he continued discarding for the next two turns. Meanwhile, Reiji Andou was attempting to capitalize on his opponent's bad fortune, casting a turn three [Gravegouger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravegouger), a turn four [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate), and a turn five [Zombie Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Assassin). Not the quickest beatdown ever, but it did the job. By the time Marco Blume was able to cast his first spell, a [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog), Reiji Andou had a [Zombie Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Assassin), a [Gravegouger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravegouger) enchanted with [Ghostly Wings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Wings), and a second [Gravegouger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravegouger) in play and Marco was at 10 life.

The [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog) didn't stick around long, dying to a [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), and Reiji was victorious, winning two games to zero.

**Final Result:** Andou 2, Blume 0
