The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 30, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [rotation day](https://twitter.com/TrickMTG/status/781875027314548737)! Welcome *Kaladesh*! Goodbye *Dragons of Tarkir* and *Magic Origins*.


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [StarCityGames.com Indianapolis Open Weekend](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/011016_indianapolis_fact_sheet.html)

Will people have the cards to play in new Standard yet? We'll find out as Saturday and Sunday feature 15 total rounds of Standard play starting at 10 a.m. both days on [twitch.tv/scglive](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive). The only guarantee is that no one will be casting [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company). Because they can't.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [*Kaladesh* stream with Marshall Sutcliffe](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering/videos/10157427854325307/) | Wizards of the Coast

Yesterday, in anticipation of *Kaladesh* releasing, we brought in *the* Marshall Sutcliffe (he's so dreamy in person) to talk *Kaladesh* in a live Facebook stream that you can check out at the link above or the video below. Note that there was an audio issue for the first minute of the stream, so you can probably just skip that.

1. [Madcap Experiment: Too Good in Modern?](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/madcap-experiment/) | Top Level Podcast | Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores

Well, Chapin called [Madcap Experiment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Madcap+Experiment) "Treasure Cruise–good," so you can see where this is heading. Basically, the combination with [Platinum Emperion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Emperion) has Chapin gushing, and you can listen to the whole shtick—plus talk of other new Modern combos—in their podcast.


1. [The Pinnacle of Artifact Design](http://manadeprived.com/comics/durdling-around-195-pinnacle-artifact-design/) | Mana Deprived | Dave Lee

[Dovin Baan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dovin+Baan) knows a powerful weapon when he sees one.


1. [Playing Control Decks in New Standard](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33770_Playing-Control-Decks-In-New-Standard.html) | StarCityGames.com | Andrew Brown

Cards like [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter) and [Fleetwheel Cruiser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleetwheel+Cruiser) have people (myself included) nervous about playing control in the new Standard—and we should be. Those are some pretty dangerous cards for a control mage. But Andrew Brown has some ideas on how to tackle the new format, Vehicles and all.


1. [Vintage 101: Uniquely Vintage](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/vintage-101-uniquely-vintage) | MTGGoldfish | Islandswamp

Vintage isn't exactly a hot topic right now, but these articles are always cool, and the decks in today's article are all unique and interesting—something that you don't often get to say about Vintage.


1. [Three Energy Brews](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/lee-shi-tian/three-energy-brews) | MTGMintCard | Lee Shi Tian

Energy Brews are generally most useful when you need to stay up late, or you need a jolt of energy to get you going. They can be purchased at most conveni...wait, that's not what you're talking about? And here I thought this was advice for gamers looking to finish out a Grand Prix Day One with some weird sugar concoction.


I guess instead this is about brewing with the newest mechanic in *Magic*, energy. Lee Shi Tian has three different decks—oh, now I get it!—and shares them readily with you.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> What was the last major change to [#mtgo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtgo?src=hash) that you liked?

There were a lot of tweets I could have chosen to represent all of the discussion over the *Magic Online* [changes announced yesterday](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-online-treasure-chests-and-pricing-changes-2016-09-29), but I went with one that was at least a bit constructive, as the discussion this morning has shifted (somewhat) from "These changes are terrible, please don't" to "These changes are terrible, but let's talk about them." To be fair, people are [still trying to figure out exactly what these changes mean](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/557bf2/oc_breaking_down_the_ev_of_treasure_chests_xpost/), and doing a lot of math to try to compare the old prize structure to the new. And while different people are coming up with different conclusions, the conclusions seem to range from "This is okay, and kind of cool/interesting" to "This is terrible and I hate your mother."


That said, there have been [positive](https://twitter.com/dwpoker/status/781647767886110721) [reactions](https://twitter.com/CalebDMTG/status/781645337429553152) and [constructive suggestions](https://twitter.com/BraunDuinIt/status/781566197192024064) for continued improvement. There was a similar backlash when Play Points were introduced, so many are in a "wait and see" mode. As is the *Magic Online* team. We are listening and are able to re-evaluate if Treasure Chests don't work out the way we expect.

Ah yes, the regular blitzing of the Twitter feed with [#KenjiWayfinder](https://twitter.com/hashtag/kenjiwayfinder?f=tweets&vertical=default) decklists, a cherished tradition. There are tons of lists coming out of this hashtag, so follow and learn.


And if you have any question why I picked that particular Tweet to highlight, well, you haven't been paying attention.
