![Power Conduit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Power+Conduit)No, not [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Counterspell) -- *counters*.

As [Mark Gottlieb wrote](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mg90) here on MagicTheGathering.com a few weeks ago, counters got a lot more versatile since the printing of *Mirrodin's* 
**[Power Conduit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Conduit)** (see also *Unglued's* 
[Giant Fan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Fan)). 

 Since the [Power Conduit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Power%2BConduit) moves counters so efficiently, it's prime for a counter-centric deck, but what to choose? There are literally hundreds of cards in **Magic** that create and use counters; here's a list of just a few (50+) interesting ones in the current Standard environment (*Onslaught* block, *Eighth Edition* and *Mirrodin*). Happy deckbuilding!

* **[Altar of Shadows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+Shadows)** - Mana at a premium? Add charge counters to this for an alternate way of building black mana.
* **[Aven Farseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Farseer)** - Leave your +1/+1 counters on the flyer, or power up some other card with the Conduit.
* **[Aven Warhawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Warhawk)** - All of *Legions'* amplify creatures can drum up piles of +1/+1 counters to move around or convert into charge counters.
* **[Banshee's Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banshee%27s+Blade)** - A recipe for a fat creature, or a renewable source of counters.
* **[Battlegrowth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlegrowth)** - Basic, but cost-effective.
![Carrion Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Carrion+Feeder)* **[Canopy Crawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Crawler)**
* **[Carrion Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder)** - An extremely tricky counter-happy creature.
* **[Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void)** - If there's one thing that plays more havoc with your opponent than the Chalice, it's a Chalice that changes how many charge counters it has on it. Bounce your 4-mana guy, bump the Chalice up to four?
* **[Clockwork Beetle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Beetle)** - All the Clockwork creatures generate a nice supply of counters to move around.
* **[Clockwork Condor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Condor)**
* **[Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon)**
* **[Clockwork Vorrac](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Vorrac)**
* **[Consumptive Goo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consumptive+Goo)** - Kill a 1/1 critter, gain a counter to play with.
* **[Daru Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Stinger)** - The Stinger is truly scary with lots of +1/+1 counters on it. Pile 'em on!
* **[Decree of Savagery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Savagery)** - This creates either a huge pile of counters to manipulate, or a LOT of huge piles of counters.
* **[Decree of Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Silence)** - Sadly you can't recharge this Decree, since it runs on depletion counters, not charge counters. But it's a source of counters nonetheless.
![Dragon Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dragon+Blood)* **[Dragon Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Blood)** - A quintessential combo with the [Power Conduit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Conduit).
* **[Elvish Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Vanguard)** - The Vanguard is happy when other elves come into play, and the other elves are happy when the Vanguard shares his +1/+1's.
* **[Embalmed Brawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embalmed+Brawler)** - Drawback getting too painful? Conduit some of those counters elsewhere to take the load off.
* **[Entrails Feaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entrails+Feaster)** - A tricky card to get working effectively, but even better when you can put those counters to good use.
* **[Feral Throwback](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Throwback)** - Amplify 2: double the counters, double your pleasure.
* **[Force Bubble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Bubble)** - Force Bubble actually gets better when you can remove counters from it.
* **[Forge Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forge+Armor)** - Move the Forged counters around with Conduit, or Forge the Conduit itself in a pinch.
* **[Forgotten Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Ancient)** - This guy is the +1/+1 counter *champ*.
* **[Fungusaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fungusaur)** - Got a [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin)? Ping [Fungusaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fungusaur) with it, then move the +1/+1 counter to the Goblin to power it up.
* **[Ghastly Remains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Remains)** - Kill your own Remains with the Conduit in order to create a recursive discard machine.
![Fungusaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fungusaur)* **[Glowering Rogon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glowering+Rogon)**
* **[Invigorating Boon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invigorating+Boon)** - Cycle: draw a card. Boon: get a +1/+1 counter. Conduit: get some new benefit. An engine in the making.
* **[Jinxed Choker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jinxed+Choker)** - If it comes around to you, strip it of its counters to power up your creatures before sending it off again.
* **[Kilnmouth Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kilnmouth+Dragon)** - This guy doesn't need any combos to make him sick, but of course, the Conduit makes him sicker.
* **[Kurgadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kurgadon)**
* **[Lightning Coils](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Coils)** - There might be no happier use for charge counters.
* **[Menacing Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Menacing+Ogre)**
* **[Myr Prototype](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Prototype)** - The Prototype gets out of control after a while, so use [Power Conduit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Conduit) to keep it trimmed down to a manageable size.
* **[Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone)** - There are better uses for the Stone than to convert Fate counters into +1/+1's or charge counters. But then again, if there's nothing to blow up in the meantime...
* **[Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus)** - He only comes with five +1/+1 counters? Use the Conduit to build yourself a Hexavus! Or an Octavus! Or a Dodecavus! (It would still make Pentavite tokens, though.)
![Quicksilver Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Quicksilver+Fountain)* **[Quicksilver Fountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Fountain)** - You can convert the flood counters your lands receive into beneficial +1/+1's, thereby maintaining the Fountain while your opponent keeps getting flooded.
* **[Riptide Replicator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Replicator)** - When you cast it for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif), it only made 0/0 red [Nameless Race](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nameless%2BRace) tokens. But after moving some counters around, now you can make 4/4s!
* **[Serum Tank](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank)** - Nobody's casting artifacts? Hook the Conduit up to your Tank and keep on drawing.
* **[Slith Ascendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Ascendant)** - All the Sliths generate +1/+1 counters to play with.
* **[Slith Bloodletter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Bloodletter)**
* **[Slith Firewalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Firewalker)**
* **[Slith Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Predator)**
* **[Slith Strider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Strider)**
* **[Stag Beetle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stag+Beetle)** - He comes into play with at *least* one +1/+1 present for every one of your creatures!
* **[Sun Droplet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Droplet)** - It's a needlessly complex way to gain 1 life per turn, but the Conduit can ensure you never miss an activation of the Droplet.
* **[Trap Digger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trap+Digger)** - Although not every card uses charge counters, any card that can repeatedly make counters of any type to fuel the Conduit is useful. [Trap Digger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trap+Digger) is one of them.
* **[Triskelion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion)** - Trike turns +1/+1 counters into zero-mana, colorless direct damage. Did someone say "win condition"?
* **[Unspeakable Symbol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unspeakable+Symbol)** - Though the life cost adds up, getting as many +1/+1 counters as you want for zero mana is still fuel to consider.
* **[War Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Elemental)** - He gets big quick. He might even win the game before you have a chance to offload all his counters...
* **[Wurmskin Forger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmskin+Forger)** - He's not just a 5/5 elf, he's three activations of the Conduit.
* **[Zombie Brute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Brute)**
