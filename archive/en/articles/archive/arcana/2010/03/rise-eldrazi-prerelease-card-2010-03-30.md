As you may already know (and if you don't, we're making it our business to inform you right now), the *Rise of the Eldrazi* Prerelease will be on the weekend of April 17-18. And if you go to one and play in the event, and if supplies hold out, you'll get one of these lovely alternate-art foil cards:

Note that the date of the Prerelease is stamped on it, which will come in handy if you're having trouble remembering when it is. Of course, you won't have the card until after the event, but maybe you'll wander through a temporal anomaly or something. And then you'll have a handy reference. Look, it's good to be prepared, okay?
