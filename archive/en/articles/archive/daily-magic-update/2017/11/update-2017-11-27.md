The November 27, 2017 Update
============================

By Katie Allison




 Katie is a copy editor and occasional writer for DailyMTG, as well as a longtime Magic player with a fondness for giant green creatures. She especially loves Commander, despite having the patience of a fruit fly, and might glare at you if your turn takes too long. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 27, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Grand Prix Lyon](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gplyo17/highlights-of-grand-prix-lyon-2017-11-26)! With the World *Magic* Cup so close, the turnout over the weekend was spectacular, including teams and players from the WMC looking to keep honing their skills until the last possible moment. There was also some excellent cosplay and a very Danish victory.


Today's Must
============


1. [MtA VIDEO – Episode 252: I Saw a Rainbow](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-video-episode-252-i-saw-a-rainbow/) | Magic the Amateuring | Meghan Wolff and Maria Bartholdi

Maria and Meghan made another video! It went smoothly! After a brief digression (containing the quote "I'm a rock inside a balloon. I'm full of magma."), they reprise their "For the n00bs" section to answer fan questions about the stack—which, let's be real, we could all probably stand to know more about. They also talk about *Unstable*, *Iconic Masters*, and Portland. It's extremely educational.

After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [*Unstable* in Commander](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/abesargent-11272017-unstable-in-commander/) | Gathering Magic | Abe Sargent

Technically, cards from *Unstable* aren't legal in Commander—but there's nothing stopping your playgroup from deciding you want to play with the cards anyway. In fact, that's just the sort of enterprising entrepreneurship the governing bodies of Bablovia would support.


1. [Deck of the Day: Blue-Red Modules](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/deck-of-the-day-ur-modules/) | ChannelFireball | Eric Froehlich

You might be thinking to yourself, "Boy howdy, am I ever sick of energy decks!" (I assume this is how your inner monologue sounds.) And you wouldn't be alone. But have you considered that you might, in fact, just be sick of *one kind* of energy deck in its various permutations? Eric Froehlich takes an in-depth look at a list that recently went 5-0 on *Magic Online* by exploiting the interactions between [Animation Module](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animation+Module), [Fabrication Module](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabrication+Module), and [Decoction Module](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decoction+Module), and I've got to admit, it's got me more excited about energy than I've been for a while.


1. [Thank You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4DqI3iuExI) | The Mana Source | Wedge

<https://www.youtube.com/embed/K4DqI3iuExI>


Wedge has been dealing with some real difficulty in his health and personal life that has affected his output in recent months, and he made this Thanksgiving video to apologize and thank all his viewers for their support. While the apology isn't necessary, we love you, Wedge, and hope you keep doing better and taking care of yourself.


1. [Finding *Magic: The Gathering* Archetypes with Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://medium.com/@hlynurd/finding-magic-the-gathering-archetypes-with-latent-dirichlet-allocation-729112d324a6) | Medium | Hlynur Davíð Hlynsson

No, I don't really understand those words in the title—and some parts of the article flew way over my head as well—but the concept is really interesting. This guy has been using the titular Latent Dirichlet Allocation (a type of complex categorizing algorithm . . . I think) to sort and summarize *Magic* deck archetypes. This could have some interesting implications for metagame analysis, if more people had any clue how to do what he's doing!


1. [Urza, the Realest Planeswalker](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/11/urza-realest-planeswalker/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Beck Holden

There's a lot to get excited about with *Unstable* (Supervillains! Contraptions! Normal and innocent armchairs!), including the first *Un*-planeswalker in Urza, Academy Headmaster. But I was still surprised to see Beck call him "the most flavorful representation of a pre-mending Planeswalker that we will ever see." I hadn't thought of it that way, but honestly, I see his point. After all, do you really think the magically preserved head of a godlike millennia-old being cares much about what you want?


1. [*Iconic Masters* and an Interview with Kenji Egashira](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-416-iconic-masters-and-an-interview-with-kenji-egashira/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Kenji Egashira

Yes, that's right: no LSV this week, but Marshall got Kenji instead to talk *Iconic Masters*. They discuss specific cards as well as mechanics and synergies (spoiler alert: rebound cards are better than they look). Their experiences with the set seem to mirror my own so far in one important way, which is that every archetype—and every draft—plays differently. It can make drafting a bit more challenging, as you need to shift your mindset considerably based on your plan, but it also adds an exciting level of variety.


1. [Epilepsy Foundation Fundraiser and Giveaway Winners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c0OSoop8OQ) | Young Mage | Rhino

In case you didn't already love Rhino enough, over the weekend he did a fundraising stream to fight epilepsy. This video is his chance to award prizes to some lucky sponsors, as well as thank everyone who donated and participated. Thank *you*, Rhino, for using your *Magic* skills to help so many people!

Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Peter Sottile's Mono-White Vehicles](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=117505)

Mardu Vehicles has been an Official Thing for some time now, but this is my first time seeing a mono-white version. Peter Sottile took this list to an 8th-place finish at a StarCityGames.com Classic on November 18—impressively, higher in the standings than any Mardu list.


The deck sacrifices speedy removal like [Fatal Push](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Push) and [Unlicensed Disintegration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration) for a streamlined mana base and [Gideon of the Trials](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+of+the+Trials)—a risky move on paper, but one that has clearly paid off. It seems as though we might be seeing a surge in mono-colored decks trying to race the powerful multicolored strategies, and Mono-White Vehicles could be poised to strike at a weak spot in the metagame.
