*Hello!  
  

It's still Worlds Week and the schedule is still important, so to re-emphasize the point, we're repeating this Arcana. If you're not interested in Worlds Week, though, don't worry: We'll have an all-new Arcana for you tomorrow!*

When this article publishes, I will be flying at 40,000 ft (12,192 m) on my way to Amsterdam for both the World Championship and the World **Magic**  Cup! I'm super excited to go and watch all five days of **Magic** by the best players in the world battle.


Since we're holding two events that overlap I wanted to take today's Arcana to share the broadcast schedule and explain some of what is going to go on.

Quick explanation since there might be confusion for new players:


* [World **Magic** Cup](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtg/event/worldmagiccup13) - This tournament features national teams from countries around the world. Last year, Puerto Rico and Chinese Taipei duked it out in the finals before Chinese Taipei won it all.
* [World Championship](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/worldchamp/2013/info) - This was known as the **Magic** Players Championship last year. It is the sixteen best players in the world battling it out in a high stakes tournament that pits them against each other round after round.

If you happened to miss it, definitely check out [the feature by Rich Hagon](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/258) on DailyMTG.com for a deeper discussion about the stories and what is happening. Below is just a quick guide to what's happening each day.


### Wednesday, July 31, 2013


Wednesday is all about the World Championship. Sixteen of the world's best players will face off with *Modern Masters* Draft (Rounds 1–3) and Standard for Rounds 4–6.


### Thursday, August 1, 2013


On Thursday, the World Championship competitors will start the day off drafting ***Magic** 2014* in Rounds 7–9 and then playing Modern to finish the day for Rounds 10–12.


### Friday, August 2, 2013


On Friday, we switch away from the World Championship and turn to the teams in the World **Magic** Cup. The teams will build ***Magic** 2014* Sealed before then competing with Unified Standard. Unified Standard means that the teams must play Standard decks, but no card can be represented more than four times total in all of each team's decks.


### Saturday, August 3, 2013


On Saturday, we'll battle with *Return to Ravnica* Block Team Sealed (each team receives twelve booster packs, four of each set in *Return to Ravnica*  Block) where they must build three team decks out of a shared pool of cards. Then for the second part of the day we're back to Unified Standard to determine which teams advance from group play.


### Sunday, August 4, 2013


Sunday is perhaps the most exciting day in **Magic**, ever. The day will begin with Unified Standard as we watch the World **Magic** Cup Top 8 duke it out until one nation stands atop. Once that is done it's time for the Top 4 from the World Championship to close out this amazing week of **Magic** as they in turn compete playing Modern.


### Broadcast Schedule


So that's what's happening in Amsterdam, let's talk about your experience at home. We will be doing five days of **Magic** coverage for the event—that's five days of live streaming and five days of written content!


Since we're broadcasting live from Amsterdam, and this event takes place across weekdays, we're going to be rebroadcasting the day's events a half hour after we end each day's broadcast. You'll be able to visit either [Twitch.tv/magic](/en/events/coverage/pro-tour%E2%80%93amsterdam-standard-qualifier-season-top-8-decklists) (beware the chat) or [wizards.com/webcast](http://www.wizards.com/webcast) and view SPOILER-FREE. We'll be keeping both of those pages as spoiler free as possible (beware the Twitch chat, though.)


Spoiler-conscious viewers should also consider avoiding [DailyMTG.com](http://www.dailymtg.com)'s coverage as well as social media lest they have match results spoiled.


Here is a breakdown of the start times for the live broadcast each day, broken out by timezones. It's much harder for us to predict the start of the rebroadcast given the dynamic nature of **Magic** tournaments.
