Saturday, 11:45 a.m. - A Brand New Standard
===========================================



 Posted in **Event Coverage**
 on December 4, 2014 









As Aaron Forsythe previously mentioned, "Jace, the Mind Sculptor is appearing in winning deck lists an alarming percentage of the time, with Stoneforge Mystic appearing almost as often. For reference, 88% of the decks in Day 2 of Grand Prix Singapore contained multiple copies of Jace, and almost 70% of the Day 2 decks contained Stoneforge Mystic."


If you happened to have just emerged from a Remote Isle or a Deserted Temple, here is a little update for you. These two cards will pretty much cease to exist in Standard with effect from 1 July 2011 (yesterday), unless players choose to play with the "War of Attrition" Event Deck, which is tournament legal only if kept entirely intact.

This promises to be a fresh change for anyone who has been paying attention to the Standard Metagame in recent months. No more turn three Batterskulls cheated into play via Stoneforge Mystic. No more losing to Jaces when you aren't playing with Jaces yourself. Most importantly, no more dreaded Caw Blade mirrors causing excessive draws!


It is believed that the departure of these two cards will cause several previous old decks to reemerge and cause new brews to sprout out. Are you ready to face a brave new world?
