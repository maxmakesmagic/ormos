After three weeks of voting, the readership of **magicthegathering.com**  has made its decision, and [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) will be banned from all Constructed formats in DCI-sanctioned play.


Since the creation of the Banned/Restricted list in January 1994, players have asked for more direct input into which cards get banned. So now, on the tenth anniversary of the list's creation, Wizards of the Coast is pleased to announce that the decisions have been handed over to the Internet community, which has decided on [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver).

The voting started on March 11 with a field of 16 cards. To give players the illusion of choice, a team of experts worked around the clock to provide a scientifically selected group of cards designed to appeal to all segments of the player base. And then they realized at the last second that they had only fourteen cards, so they threw in [Crazed Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crazed+Goblin) and [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Plains) at the last second.


The unimaginably complex process of tabulating the votes was done by a state-of-the-art PDP-11, and a team of crack scienticians is working around the clock to track the voting trends and look behind the numbers to discern exactly what the voting public was thinking. Their findings will be presented Monday, April 5.


"We're delighted with the way this turned out," said a representative of the DCI, who prefers to remain anonymous. "From now on, we'll just make all of our decisions this way. If the players make the decisions, they won't be able to complain about anything!"


The next vote, "Which card will be Restricted in Type I" is scheduled to start on April 21 and will run for seventeen months.
