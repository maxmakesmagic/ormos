You might have noticed that we've had a sample *Shadowmoor* booster pack in the right side of the web site the last couple of days. (You might also notice that it's gone now. Oh no! I hope it gets hidden somewhere else on the website!) Are you curious about what *Shadowmoor* will look like when it's all packaged up, waiting hopefully for you to rip it open and play with it? Well, like this:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1545_SHM_1.jpg)Ooh! He's creepy-looking! Let's look at another!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1545_SHM_2.jpg)Why, that's our old friend the Reaper King! That pack looks familiar somehow. Maybe it was mentioned in an earlier paragraph. Oh, well. No time! Onward!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1545_SHM_3.jpg)Excellent! Say, how about if we mix things up a bit. Let's look at a tournament pack!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1545_SHM_td.jpg)What theâ€” is that a monster from the squamous depths? Neat! Okay, back to boosters:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1545_SHM_4.jpg)Hmm. That guy looks pretty neat. I think there's one more booster.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1545_SHM_5.jpg)Yow! That guy's on fire! And of course, all the boosters will come handsomely packaged in a display box, which will look a little something...like this:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1545_SHM_display.jpg)Whew! That's a lot for one day. Remember, *Shadowmoor* previews start on March 31. But there still might be more sneaky previews around the site before then...
