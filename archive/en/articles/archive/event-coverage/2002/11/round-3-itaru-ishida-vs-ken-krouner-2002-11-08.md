![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a561.jpg)Ken Krouner's winning smile hasn't faded since his Top 8 appearance at Worlds in August. He still sports the same dye-job hairdo and completely easygoing nature. Waiting for his deck to pass inspection, Krouner had a minute to talk about his deck choice. He said that he chose The Rock because it's a deck that goes 55% against everything, and the field was too wide-open to predict. 

"Though, I asked Ishida what he's played so far, and it was two Rock decks. He's 2-0." - Ken Krouner

Ishida's playing the Japanese take on Extended [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), and with so many combo decks around [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)'s got to be good again. Ishida seems to have opened up a bit following the festivities at the Invitational, flashing a rare smile as he wished Krouner good luck.

Krouner stared at his opening hand for a full minute before committing to sending it back with a frown. He did, however, take the forbidden peek at the top four, and sighed contentedly at what he saw. He kept his six. Ishida's hand needed no improvement. 

Krouner started with two [Birds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds), [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and [Vine Trellis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vine+Trellis) opposite Ishida's pair of islands. He started to swing for three. Ishida was happy to wait. Krouner was out of gas, holding just a pair of Deeds. [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) at end of turn fetched [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition). Ishida untapped and dropped [Sapphire Medallion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapphire+Medallion). Krouner pulled a [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend), but Ishida protected his investment with [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell).

Down came the [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition). "[Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s?" Ishida just laughed. He got his [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge)s and drew three. Then he untapped and busted out [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Krouner blew the deed to delay the party, but Ishida got ready to refuel with a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for [Stroke of Genius](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius). All this time Krouner was hitting with his Village. At eight Ishida [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul)led the second Deed. At five he Stroked for five and [Thwart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thwart)ed another. The Village brought him to two.

Ishida calmly untapped, Wished for [Corpse Dance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Dance), and played his sixth land to dance the 'Tog into play for lethal damage.

Ishida 1 - Krouner 0

This time around Krouner led with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). He saw [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition), [Sapphire Medallion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapphire+Medallion), [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul), [Treachery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery) and two lands. Naturally he took the Medallion. Ishida played a land and passed it back. [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) for [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) saw that he'd drawn a second one.

Now Krouner was rolling. Ishida played a second land and was faced with [Phyrexian Negator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Negator). He played his third and saw Krouner flash his Therapy back while playing out [Dust Bowl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Bowl). Ishida minimized the damage by [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ing for [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge)s, saving the second Intution in his hand, but leaving him just one Knowledge in his deck. Krouner Bowled away a land, and with Negator and Treetop on board, there was nothing Ishida could do.

Ishida 1 - Krouner 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a563.jpg)Ishida didn't like it, but he knew he had to send back his first hand. Krouner had no trouble keeping his. He led with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), stealing [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) and seeing [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). His second turn he played [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), and again, Ishida had drawn a second Wish.

With Ishida's hand dismantled, Krouner set about killing him. [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) got him his fifth land, a [Dust Bowl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Bowl), enabling [Spiritmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger). [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) and [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) soon followed. Ishida's draws of [Sapphire Medallion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapphire+Medallion), [Powder Keg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Powder+Keg) and [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) were no match.

"I'm a lucky man." - Ken Krouner

**Final Result:** Ken Krouner defeats Itaru Ishida 2-1
