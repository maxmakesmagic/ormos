**ARTISTS: JOHN AVON and ANTHONY S. WATERS**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/events/images/John_Avon.jpg)John was born in Wales in 1961 and grew up with drawing as his main hobby. Soon it became clear that being an artist was to be his role in life and alongside music, is his passion. From the early 1980’s John has worked on many book covers for notable authors, primarily in Fantasy & Sci/Fi, also working extensively on national advertising campaigns, product design, and recently a major board game (still in production).


Without doubt when John first worked on **Magic: The Gathering** (his first expansion was *Mirage*) he found an expression for his artwork. This still remains at the forefront of his work as a commercial illustrator. Sets like *Ravnica* and *Mirrodin* have enabled John to develop his skills and reach a worldwide audience. Whilst he is best known for his Land art, John recently worked on the ‘Sojourners’ cycle of cards for *Alara Reborn* and enjoyed putting figures into a fantastical setting.


John Avon lives just outside Brighton on the South Coast of England, with his illustrator wife Pat and two son’s Laurence and James.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra09/artist_waters.jpg)Anthony Scott Waters is a concept artist and illustrator based in Southern California. His career has taken him from the early days of interactive software all the way to Hollywood, with many stops in between. He’s known as a monster maker and environment designer for **Magic**  as well as companies like Microsoft, Hasbro and Electronic Arts. His work has also been featured in **Spectrum: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art**, issues 9 through 14, and toured the country in the **MacExpo Digital Art Show**. His professional portfolio can be viewed at [www.thinktankstudios.com](http://www.thinktankstudios.com). His [Deviant Art](http://fyreant.deviantart.com/) contains a wide sampling of his work, possibly including things that could be considered deviant. [bloated-nose.blogspot.com](http://bloated-nose.blogspot.com) is where Anthony blogs, mostly about things much less disgusting than the blog's title might suggest.
