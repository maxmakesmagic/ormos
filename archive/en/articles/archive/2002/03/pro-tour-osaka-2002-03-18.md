The Magic Colony wins Pro Tour - Osaka! It may have been a laughable off-chance going into Day 2, but Ken Ho fought hard through Day 2, winning his last match to score a spot in the Top 8. In the finals he met man of destiny Olivier Ruel, whose last-place finish in the Magic Invitational meant he's due to win a Pro Tour this year. Ruel confirmed it by taking the first two games. But with his back against the wall, Ho smashed through to victory. What's more, he was carried there on the back of his most-mocked card: [Tarnished Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarnished+Citadel). Congratulations to Ken Ho, Pro Tour - Osaka Champion!


### Ken Ho, Champion, Pro Tour Osaka 2002
