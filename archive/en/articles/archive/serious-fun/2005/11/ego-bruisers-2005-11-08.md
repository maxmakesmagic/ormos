Right off the bat, I want everyone to understand my philosophy when it comes to blue-black in multiplayer.


*In group games, blue-black exists to blow up combo decks.*


That's it. Nothing else. Now, some of you may have other ideas about blue-black in multiplayer, with fancy "creatures" that "fly" and "attack" for "damage" – but when you get down to the fundamental value of this color combination, it's in stopping the lunatics.


I went through a phase in ***Magic** Online* where I actively sought to blow up combo decks – I was just getting tired of seeing [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse), and [Mirari's Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake), and [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail), and [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest), and skeighty-eight million other green-based cards that fed off of mana acceleration and big creatures. Don't get me wrong – I'm happy green's doing well in **Magic** nowadays. I just wanted to have some fun with the metagame.


And I did. I took full advantage of the online collection Wizards generously supplies its writers and I built a blue-black deck based on the following fragment:



> 
> *KnockItOff.deq*
>   
> *Multiplayer deck fragment*
>   
>   
> *4 [Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extract)*
>   
> *4 [Nezumi Graverobber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Graverobber)*

>   
> *3 [Bribery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery)*
> 

![Psychogenic Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Psychogenic+Probe)It featured [Psychogenic Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychogenic+Probe) as a secondary win condition (which was my attempt to make [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction) a bit funnier than it probably would have seemed on its own) and eventually punched through with a few tricky wizards or whatever I managed to [Bribery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery) out of an opponent's deck.
 It did very well against the field for the short time I played it. It did such wonderful, extraordinary things! [Willbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Willbender)s re-aimed [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest)s at my teammate. Decks that depended upon [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and [Wayfarer's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble) to find mana took eight damage at a time from [Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Probe)s. Players with four copies of [Kokusho, the Evening Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kokusho%252C%2Bthe%2BEvening%2BStar) placed neatly in their graveyard suddenly found they had no Patriarch's Bidding left in their decks.


It was, in a word, magical.


Meanwhile, decks that were new and innovative – that is, decks I couldn't anticipate because I hadn't seen them dozens of times before – gave my blue-black deck fits. There were tons of better control decks that I couldn't beat. Heck, simple aggression decks filled with nothing but commons and uncommons could roll right past my fragile wizards and their flimsy defenses. And I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. I wasn't trying to show off with lots of rares – I was trying to let off steam against a lot of players who weren't putting any creative effort into their decks.


It doesn't surprise me at all that blue-black was the place I went. This bruising color combination has what I'd term "strategic assassins". Assassins aren't good at stopping waves of enemies already on the battlefield. They are, however, excellent at preventing generals and key personnel from getting to the battlefield in the first place. They're also experts in misdirection and disruption – an enemy has to be ready with a steady flow of soldiers, or they'll lose the battle.


If your group is playing too many combo decks, you should take a serious look at this color combination. Let's get into the questions I'm asking each guild week:


### WHAT BLUE-BLACK MULTIPLAYER BOMBS ARE IN THE NEW SET?


There's already a bit of talk out there about [Circu, Dimir Lobotomist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circu%2C+Dimir+Lobotomist) as a possible tournament contender. So we'll just glance over him, noting simply that he's good for multiplayer formats that want to control combo decks as well.


![Bloodletter Quill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bloodletter+Quill)**[Bloodletter Quill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodletter+Quill)** is on my list as a great "blue-black" card in group games. While any color deck can use the Quill, only UB decks can repeatedly use it. You don't necessarily have to pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) for each card, though that's the least painful way to go about it. You can draw cards for a while using only two mana, and then save a bunch of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) mana to clean up the Quill when it gets a bit full. Depends on how risky you like things. The overall point is that the Quill represents one of the cheapest ways for a deck to continually draw cards – it's high in the "cockroach" element I discussed a few columns ago.
 You can use a few interesting cards with the Quill – most notably, [Chisei, Heart of Oceans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chisei%2C+Heart+of+Oceans) and [Power Conduit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Conduit). Heck, even [Ferropede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ferropede) can be helpful here.


Another card that relies heavily on a reusable ability is **[Dimir Doppelganger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Doppelganger)**. Assuming you have a way of getting creature cards into someone's graveyard (yours, or someone else's), the Doppelganger can switch identities with ease.


The Doppelganger probably benefits most easily from milling strategies, so I would recommend using it in decks already having fun with [Mesmeric Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Orb) and [Dreamborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamborn+Muse). It also works well with our next featured card today.


**[Szadek, Lord of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Szadek%2C+Lord+of+Secrets)** is a legendary creature which, like Circu, is getting a lot of buzz across multiple parts of the **Magic** community. He may be too expensive for tournaments; but he most certainly is *not* too expensive for us casual players. 


While Szadek's most obvious use is in milling, he's also impressive as a source of +1/+1 counters for creative decks – say, [Spike Rogue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Rogue) and/or [Spike Cannibal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Cannibal) decks – that feed off of such counters.


![Mindleech Mass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mindleech+Mass)**[Mindleech Mass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindleech+Mass)** is our final, and possibly most impressive, entry for new UB in multiplayer. Finding an open defender is so much easier in group games than in duels – and once he tramples through for damage, you can use a removal card in the defender's hand to blow up someone *else's* defenders. And then you attack that player, if and when you want to sample the cards over there.
 Funny story: I once hit someone with a [Mindleech Mass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindleech+Mass) and ran across one of the very few absolutely unplayable cards: [Master Warcraft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Warcraft). Wow, that was annoying. And countermagic is also difficult to steal with the Mass. But other than that, the Mass is a house in group play.


### WHAT BLUE-BLACK MULTIPLAYER BOMBS MIGHT WE HAVE FORGOTTEN?


**[Nebuchadnezzar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nebuchadnezzar).**  This fellow doesn't work too quickly, but he works consistently. He rips apart combo decks, which is what most of this column is all about; so I couldn't have a list like this and not mention him. (Yes, [Lobotomy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lobotomy) does it faster and harsher. But [Lobotomy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lobotomy) hits one player, and is gone. Good ol' Neb can turn to the next opponent and enrage them, as well.)


**[Spinal Embrace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spinal+Embrace).** One of my favorite instants in multiplayer, period. I've written plenty on this card in the past. But the trick never gets old.


**[Breathstealer's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breathstealer%27s+Crypt).**  A nice showstopper, especially in decks that can overcome the life disadvantage. There are at least two ways: gain life (e.g., [Spinal Embrace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spinal+Embrace)), or play creatureless. You can also use this with stuff like [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) or [Patriarch's Bidding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Bidding), where you *want* the creature to go to the graveyard.


Note how well the Crypt works with [Dimir Doppelganger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Doppelganger), above.


**![Reverberation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reverberation) Reverberation.** Yes, it's mono-blue. But I want to recommend this very obscure card to those who (a) love weird corners of *Legends* and (b) have to deal with ceaseless waves of games that involve dumb "infinite damage" combos. Note the restriction here – this only works against sorceries! Even if your group uses [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) and such all the time, you shouldn't have more than one copy in your deck – heck, a [Willbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Willbender) will do as much (or more) in many situations. But you may just get lucky enough to nail someone who attempts a game-ending [Hurricane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurricane). That's good storytelling.


### WHAT CHEAP, EFFECTIVE CARDS CAN ROUND OUT A BLUE-BLACK DECK?


Cheap UB cards really didn't happen in **Magic** until *Invasion* block. [Recoil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoil) is the measuring stick I use for good UB utility; [Clutch of Undeath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+Undeath) comes close.


**For creatures:** In addition to the excellent [Dimir Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Guildmage) and decent [Lurking Informant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Informant), you should also consider stuff that can hold the ground and make untapping easier. [Tidewater Minion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidewater+Minion) has already proven itself excellent in limited formats for milling decks. Generally, good limited commons and uncommons make for excellent and easy acquisitions in a strong multiplayer deck.


**For removal:**  Following the same logic, cards like [Curfew](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curfew) and [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) should be okay. However, avoid using too much spot removal in a UB deck. Good control decks are already reserving some "spot removal" for combo pieces, with one-off disposable spells like [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). Make sure your removal is either reusable (e.g., [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict)) or widespread (e.g., [Infest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest)).
