**leg·er·de·main**

![Legerdemain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Legerdemain)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: Middle English, from Middle French *leger de main* light of hand  
 Date: 15th century  
 1 : sleight of hand  
 2 : a display of skill or adroitness
 **bey**

![Viashino Bey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Viashino+Bey)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: Turkish, gentleman, chief  
 Date: 1595  
 1 a : a provincial governor in the Ottoman Empire b : the former native ruler of Tunis or Tunisia

 **Roh·gahh**

![Rohgahh of Kher Keep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rohgahh+of+Kher+Keep)  
 From Steve Conard, *Legends* designer:  
 Function: proper noun  
 Etymology: Rohgahh's original name was "Ur-aah-ah of Kher Keep". We wanted a name that was unpronounceable by humans; it was meant to be a guttural-sounding name. During the editing process it was changed to "Uriah of Kher Keep". That name was laughable as it sounded like "Uriah Heep of Kher Keep" (Uriah Heep is the name of a band and a character in Dickens' *David Copperfield*). The name was subsequently changed to Rohgahh, which was a good guttural compromise.
