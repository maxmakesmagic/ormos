Cards like [Clockspinning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning), [Paradox Haze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradox+Haze), [Dust of Moments](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+of+Moments), and [Rift Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Elemental) are great cards in the *Time Spiral* Block for manipulating time counters. And there are plenty of ways to abuse them: speed up your [Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Greater%2BGargadon), slow down the vanishing of [Waning Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Waning%2BWurm) or [Reality Acid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Reality%2BAcid), keep bad things [Delay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Delay) or hasten [Jhoira of the Ghitu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Jhoira%2Bof%2Bthe%2BGhitu).

However, there are a couple of cards *outside* of the *Time Spiral* Block that you might consider for your time-counter-manipulation decks.



![Tourach's Gate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tourach%27s+Gate)

Keep [Tourach's Gate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tourach%27s+Gate) in play without having to sacrifice any Thrulls!





![Infinite Hourglass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Infinite+Hourglass)

Load up [Infinite Hourglass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infinite+Hourglass) with counters faster than your opponents can remove them!





![Time Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Time+Bomb)

And our personal favorite: charge up a ticking [Time Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Bomb) to blow the board (and any players at low life totals) to smithereens.
