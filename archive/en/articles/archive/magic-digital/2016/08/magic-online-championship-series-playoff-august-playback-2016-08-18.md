 Better known as NumotTheNummy, Kenji is a lover of all things Magic. A "legendary streamer," you can almost always find him playing Magic Online over at his Twitch channel. When he's not playing Magic, Kenji enjoys long walks on the beach, romantic comedies, and devouring the hopes and dreams of the innocent. 






The [*Magic: The Gathering* Online Championship Series](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2016-magic-online-championship-series), also known as MOCS, is a series of events in which sixteen of the top *Magic Online* players can earn an invitation to the annual in-person *Magic Online* Championship event, where they compete for a prize pool of $116,000. Aside from the defending *Magic Online* Champion and the current *Magic* World Champion, other players can qualify for the *Magic Online* Championship by climbing their way to the Top 6 positions on the MOCS leaderboard or being one of the Top 2 players in a Monthly Playoff Event.


In his latest video, streamer extraordinaire Kenji Egashira gives a play-by-play of the MOCS Playoff Event that took place just last weekend. Kenji analyzes the matchups and the deck tech, and tells the tale of how a Top 8 event between the best players on *Magic Online*—and the world—turned out. Enjoy!
