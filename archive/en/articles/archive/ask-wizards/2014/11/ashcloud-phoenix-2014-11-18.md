Ask Wizards is a monthly feature that gives you a chance to ask us questions and have them answered. If you'd like to submit a question, please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive, [but if we can](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-tuesday-june-17-2014-06-17), it might show up in the coming months!


This month, Rules Manager Matt Tabak answers two questions about [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix).

**Q: If I cast [Burn Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burn+Away) (on my turn) on an opponent's [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix), what will happen?** 



A: In this case, [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix) dying causes two abilities to trigger: its own and the delayed triggered ability of [Burn Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burn+Away). Since you control the ability from [Burn Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burn+Away), it will go on the stack first, followed by [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix)'s ability, which will resolve first. The Phoenix returns to the battlefield face down. Then your opponent's graveyard is exiled, although the Phoenix has successfully escaped by then.


**Q: If I use [Twinflame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twinflame) on [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix) and then the token it creates dies, does it return to the battlefield face-down, as per the Phoenix's ability?** 


A: Once a token leaves the battlefield, it can't return. It will cease to exist the next time state-based actions are performed.
