### ...At Gen Con SoCal 2004

That's right, at [Gen Con SoCal](http://www.gencon.com/socalhome.aspx?file=socal), Mark Rosewater will be donning a donkey suit and presiding over a massive *Unhinged* Tournament! If you're in Southern California or think you can get there in the next few days, you won't want to miss it!

People are still talking about Mark's epic chicken suit from the *Unglued* release. Do you want to be left out of the stories and anecdotes this time around? Of course you don't!

And Gen Con SoCal isn't just *Unhinged*! It's the best four days in gaming, featuring qualifiers for Pro Tour Atlanta *and* Pro Tour Nagoya, a **Star Wars TCG** Tournament where you could win your very own lightsaber, and [much, much more](http://www.gencon.com/displaysocal.aspx?file=socal-event-highlights)!

So what are you waiting for?
