When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he wanted a job making Magic cards. Ten years later, his dream was realized as his combined success as a professional player, deck builder, and writer brought him into Wizards R&D during 2011. He's been writing Magic articles since 2005 and has no plans to stop. 





Last year around this time, I previewed a door. A very specific kind of door. It looked something like this: 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Door+to+Nothingness)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+to+Nothingness)[Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf) is one of the cornerstones of a strategy like this. You always want to have access to him on turn one, and he can start churning out larger creatures faster than your opponent can reasonably deal with them. Turn-one [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf) into turn-two [Elvish Archdruid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid) is your best draw. I'd happily play more copies if I could. (If only there were more one-mana Elves in the format that made mana. Hmmm...) 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Elvish+Visionary)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) This little guy always looks so innocent—but he's a powerhouse in a strategy like this. Not only does he dig you deeper into your deck and pump how much mana your [Elvish Archdruid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid) makes, but his body is more relevant than ever in a [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) deck. He ticks up the counters on your Door by one, and then also ends up being huge thanks to the Door. I definitely want to keep all four. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zameck+Guildmage)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zameck+Guildmage) Something crucial about any tribal strategy is that you hit a critical mass of that tribe. In this deck, being an Elf grants huge advantages: working with [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies), amping up [Elvish Archdruid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid), and being cast for free with [Descendants' Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descendants%27+Path) are some of the benefits Elves have around these parts. The key, of course, is that they are an Elf. 

[Zameck Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zameck+Guildmage) is mana intensive and redundant in multiples, so normally I wouldn't play the full boat of four here. However, because of their Elven nature, this is a time I'm willing to make an exception. An extra 2/2 for two is still welcome in this deck when that 2/2 is suddenly a 6/6 that was cast for free. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gyre+Sage)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gyre+Sage)[Gyre Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gyre+Sage) hits many notes that should be welcome in this deck. It's an Elf. It makes mana. What's not to like? 

 Well, the problem is it's pretty hard to evolve. Your cheap Elves don't do it, and [Elvish Archdruid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid) doesn't even help since [Gyre Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gyre+Sage) gets larger from the Archdruid and no longer evolves. You can occasionally go crazy with a [Master Biomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Biomancer), but most of the time, [Gyre Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gyre+Sage) is just going to be a two-mana 1/2. You could play it over [Zameck Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zameck+Guildmage) for color considerations, but I'd rather have the extra base power and an ability that is very relevant when it turns on late game as opposed to an ability that becomes weaker as the game goes on. This Sage can go. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Elvish+Archdruid)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid) Along with your one-drop mana Elves, [Elvish Archdruid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid) is a key component of Standard Elves decks. Not only does he pump your team, allowing you to hit for more damage, but his mana generation is simply absurd. Untapping on turn three with six mana at your disposal and unloading a major threat from your hand can be incredibly difficult for many decks to beat. They have to remove it or lose—you definitely want all four of these. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Master+Biomancer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Biomancer) Besides just being an incredibly fun card to play with, [Master Biomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Biomancer) fits well in this strategy. It's another card that kicks up all your creatures into huge monsters. Deploying it on turn three is frightening for your opponent, as it acts like another must-remove card. I like Biomancer enough here that I'm happy to bump it up to four copies. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Golgari+Decoy)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Decoy) There are some neat tricks you can pull with [Golgari Decoy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Decoy), making it large and then forcing your opponent to block it and lose his or her creatures while your others run right past. You even get the mana in this deck to scavenge it out. 

 However, [Golgari Decoy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Decoy) doesn't have quite the impact on the board that I'd like a four-drop in this deck to have. It's only a 2/2 at base stats, and its ability is incredibly situational. It's also usually only good if you're already winning. Decoy doesn't quite fit the bill here. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Yeva%2C+Nature%27s+Herald)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yeva%2C+Nature%27s+Herald) Yeva can be quite versatile, especially in a deck like this one where you stand a lot to gain in combat from casting instant-speed creatures with a [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) on the battlefield. However, at four mana, she doesn't fit into the small end of creatures while also not having the impact that I want my late game Elf cards to have. I'd rather play other options—goodbye, Yeva! 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Craterhoof+Behemoth)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craterhoof+Behemoth)[Craterhoof Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craterhoof+Behemoth) is one of the best endgames you can have in a deck like this. This deck is full of mana generators and little creatures that swarm the board—a combination that [Craterhoof Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craterhoof+Behemoth) thrives on. I only want to play two copies because you only need one and it's weak in your opening hand. Taz has the numbers right here. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Descendants%27+Path)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descendants%27+Path)[Descendants' Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descendants%27+Path) can be a pretty hit-or-miss card. Well, okay, it is literally a hit-or-miss card, but it's figuratively one too. 

In a deck with twenty-five Elves, you're going to hit slightly less than half of the time. This means that it'll work, on average, every other turn. Would you play a card that said, "Every other turn, draw a card."?

Well, it depends on the deck.

 In this deck, it is helping you hit a critical mass of creatures and give you a little bit of card advantage. Additionally, it also does cast the creature, which is certainly better than just drawing a card. (Note that Path does cast the creature, meaning it triggers [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies)!) 

 Something else to note is that, if you miss with [Descendants' Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descendants%27+Path), it sends that card to the bottom of your library. So even if you hit a land, you still clear it out of the way to try and draw a spell. This makes multiples pretty reasonable. 

 In this kind of tribal deck, I want all of the card advantage and card quality I can find. All of the benefits of [Descendants' Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descendants%27+Path) add up. Not only do I want to play it, but I even want to kick it up to four copies. In board stalls or against control decks the card advantage/quality is going to go a long way.
