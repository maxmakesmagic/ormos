Going into the last round, the coveted Day 2 slot is still open game. Many teams were sitting at 6-2, hoping for one more win to clinch a spot at the table tomorrow. Walking around the middle tables you get a good feel of the last-round action.


But first, let's do a check-in for the Top 25 players in attendance. Fifteen of the players were here battling today, spread across twelve teams. Some of them faired very well, a couple were on the fence.


No. 17 Alexander Hayne and his teammates Craig Wescoe and Frank Skarren cruised into Day 2, clinching their spot in seventh round. Clinching a bit later, No. 20 Shahar Shenhar, No. 18 Tom Martell, and their Pro Tour Hall of Fame teammate Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa reached 21 points in the eighth round. As did No. 22 Sam Black and his partners in crime, Matt Severa and Gaudenis Vidugiris.


No. 7 Ari Lax, Matt McCullough, and Alex John got there last round; No. 14 Josh Utter-Leyton, Josh Cho, and Gerry Thompson did as well. And the last spot earned in Round 8 was No. 19 Jacob Wilson, Matt Nass, and Jesse Hampton earning themselves a place in Day 2.


One did not fair so well. No. 25 Christian Calcano and his buddies Miguel Gatica and Eric Kreiter were out pretty early. But that left a fair amount of Top 25 players on the bubble.



 Returning Grand Prix Team champions, "Peach Garden Oath," No. 1 Owen Turtenwald, No. 9 William Jensen, and No. 4 Reid Duke won their last round to stay alive, but they still need a win in Round 9. No. 11 Eric Froehlich, Luis Scott-Vargas, and Paul Cheon also kept their dream alive, but were still at a hanging-by-a-thread 18 points. As were No. 23 Brad Nelson, and his coverage extraordinaire teammates, Zac Hill and Jacob Van Lunen, and No. 13 Ben Stark, and Niel Reeves and Chris Fennell.



The bubble matches were intense. In addition to the Top 25 matches, Antonino De Rosa, Gerard Fabiano, and Alex Lieberman were playing for their lives after starting 1-2; and David Ochoa, Andrew Cuneo, and Brock Parker had rattled off two straight wins to still be in contention.
