As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 





Brian Braun-Duin, or BBD, is quickly establishing himself as one of the best players in the United States. Over the last year-and-a-half, Braun-Duin has Top 8ed two Grand Prix events, winning one of them, and Top 8ed four StarCityGames Invitational events. This weekend, Braun-Duin is armed with a powerful Jeskai Stoneblade deck of his own design. The buzz around the tournament hall is that Braun-Duin had the best deck in the room.



On the other side of the table, we have Joseph Santomassino, a twenty-one year old factory worker from Litchfield, New Hampshire. This is Santomassino’s first Grand Prix and he managed to best a field of over 4000 players to find himself in the last remaining eight players in the elimination rounds. Santomassino brought a powerful MUD deck that turbocharges big artifacts into play with [Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker).



In the first game, Braun-Duin got on the board with [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) and started applying strong pressure on Santomassino with an unmolested [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull).



[Kuldotha Forgemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Forgemaster) looked like it could turn things around for Santomassino, but Braun-Duin had [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) and the race was on!

[Kuldotha Forgemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Forgemaster) started chaining out powerful artifacts like [Spine of Ish Sah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spine+of+Ish+Sah) to destroy [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) and [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) for some impressive pressure of his own.



In a heated race, Braun-Duin was eventually able to create a board state where he could attack for lethal with [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) armed with Umezawa’s Jitte.



Braun-Duin 1 - 0 Santomassino



The second game was all about [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void). The first copy from Santomassino met [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), but the second copy hit the battlefield and made the game a living hell for Braun-Duin.



Braun-Duin tried to apply pressure with [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), but [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) and Sundering Titan were enough to seal the game up for Santomassino.

Santomassino was hoping that the third game would be all about [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) too. Braun-Duin had different plans, though. [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) stopped the first [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) and [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) stopped the second.



Braun-Duin was able to refill his hand with [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and he started applying good pressure the turn thereafter.



The two copies of [Kuldotha Forgemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Forgemaster) in Santomassino’s hand were public knowledge thanks to an early [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), and Braun-Duin was able to take full advantage of the situation with [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage). [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) came down and started ticking up, but it seemed like it was already too late for the New Hampshire native and Braun-Duin would be moving on to the semifinals!



Braun-Duin 2 - 1 Santomassino
