GRAND PRIX SHIZUOKA 2013 - ROUND Round 6 - IMPRESSINOS FROM THE TOP TABLES
==========================================================================

There's a lot of Magic being played out there. With a Grand Prix of this size it's hard to distill the essence of the Day 1 metagame. I took a quick tour around the top forty or so tables to get a very unscientific breakdown of what the undefeateds are playing.


Perhaps the biggest surprise for me is that Mono-Blue Devotion decks are out in force. They were far and away the most numerous with around ten players pinning their hopes on [Master of Waves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves). Next there were three archetypes with about seven or eight players apiece: The Black-White goodstuff deck that evolved out of Mono-Black Control, Esper Control decks (surprisingly outshining straight Blue-White), and base-red Aggro decks, both the all-in on Bolts version and the more straightforward creature-based strategies.

I saw a few people playing Green-Red Devotion decks reminiscent of Makihito Mihara's Pro Tour deck. There were also a few bold souls sporting [Bant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant) colors for their Control shell. Lastly there were a smattering of White Weenie, Mono-Black Devotion, and Blue-White Control. For such a diverse field there were few real rogue decks. Although, and I don't want to say too much here, I did see a [Spellheart Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellheart+Chimera) in play.
