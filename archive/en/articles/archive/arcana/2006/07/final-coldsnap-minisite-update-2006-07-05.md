This week, Adam Lee, *Coldsnap* flavor text writer extraordinaire, brings you a tale of icy drama to complete the offerings of the *Coldsnap* minisite.

It answers the question, “When dying is not an option, what does a slain soldier do?” In other words, what are the advantages—and drawbacks—of fighting on the same battlefield as [Adarkar Valkyrie](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/flight-undying-bombs-2006-06-27)? You’ll see other *Coldsnap* cards and creatures make cameos in Adam’s story as well.


Additionally, this week the *Coldsnap* minisite reveals four Adult Swim ads that never made it to to air. You'll find them on the "[Lore From Terisiare](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/coldsnaplore/home)" page for your viewing pleasure, along with an introduction from Jake Theis of Magic Brand fame. 


That does it for the [*Coldsnap* minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/coldsnap/home), but the *Coldsnap* fun is just beginning. See you at the [prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases)!
