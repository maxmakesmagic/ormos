------------------------------


**UNITED STATES - [A-G](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/2017Nationals/invitationlist-1) H-P [Q-Z](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/2017Nationals/invitationlist-3) | [ARGENTINA - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/2017Nationals/invitationlist-4) | [ECUADOR - LUXEMBOURG](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/2017Nationals/invitationlist-5) | [MACEDONIA - WALES](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/2017Nationals/invitationlist-6)**


The following players have all met the Planeswalker Point threshold for their country and are invited to play in their respective Nationals. Please check to see if your name is on this list.


The cutoff for Planeswalker Points-based invitations to 2017 Nationals is May 28. This invitation list will be updated regularly leading up to 2017 Nationals.


If your name is not on this list and you believe it should be based on your yearly Planeswalker Points, or it is on this list but your nationality is not displaying correctly, youâ€™ll need to contact Customer Service, *and we recommend doing so as soon as possible*. Information on how to do that is below.


If you have a Wizards Account, you can contact customer service through [wizards.custhelp.com](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2305/).


If you do not have a Wizards Account, you can create one at [accounts.wizards.com](https://accounts.wizards.com/ExistingAccount/EditDetails), and then use online help at [wizards.custhelp.com](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2305/).


If those options are not available to you, you can call us at any of the [phone numbers found here](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2305/), based on your region. Note that there are limitations to the amount and type of information that can be retrieved or given out over the phone due to privacy concerns, but our customer service representatives will do the best they can to address any issues you might have.


If you are contacting customer service, you can make the process go smoother and faster by including the following information in your email or having it ready when you call:


* First and last name
