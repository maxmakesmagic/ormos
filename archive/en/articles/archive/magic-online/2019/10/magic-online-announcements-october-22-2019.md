Special Downtime, Special Events: No Entry Requirement Needed
-------------------------------------------------------------


While the headliner for Wednesday's downtime is the [introduction of Pioneer](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-pioneer-format-2019-10-21), *Magic Online* is also making some architectural changes behind the scenes. While we have been testing internally, nothing is as effective as getting changes in front of players. Because of this, we're taking a couple extra precautions on Wednesday.


We're going to start by restricting player actions to only playing in Open Play matches when we first go live. This means that all events, trades, and store purchases will be disabled. This is just to let us sanity check MTGO as players are logging in.


If that goes well, we'll turn on trade and the store about 10 minutes later. And then a few minutes after that, we'll turn on non-league events. Leagues will remain paused as we continue to validate changes.


All is not lost for you *Throne of Eldraine* fans, however, since we're going to set up two No Entry Requirement Phantom Sealed events for players to join, one League and one Scheduled Event, that will help us validate some of the changes at scale.


The League will be available right as we turn on events, and you'll have about 15 minutes to join. You'll then have about 3 hours to finish two matches. Each win you earn gets you a Player Rewards Pack that includes a random promo card.


The two-round Scheduled Event will start about one hour after we go live. Your first win gets you a Player Rewards Pack, and your second win gets you a Treasure Chest. Full details on both events can be found below.


Note that both Basic and Full accounts can participate in these events, so everyone can show up and play. And since players can create a Basic account without purchase, this is a good chance to test drive MTGO.


**NO ENTRY REQUIREMENT PHANTOM SEALED LEAGUE**


**Schedule**: This League will begin on October 23, after we return from maintenance. This league will have a 30-minute join window and a 3-hour runtime.


**Product**: 6 Phantom*Throne of Eldraine*boosters (cards drafted in the event will not be added to your collection)


**Structure**: Up to 2 matches, played at your convenience


**Entry Options**:


* No entry requirement

**Prizes**:


* 2 wins: 2 Player Rewards Packs
* 1 win: 1 Player Rewards Pack

**NO ENTRY REQUIREMENT PHANTOM SEALED SCHEDULED EVENT**


**Schedule**: This event will begin on October 23, one hour after we return from maintenance.


**Product**: 6 Phantom*Throne of Eldraine*boosters (cards drafted in the event will not be added to your collection)


**Structure**: Deckbuilding, then two rounds of Swiss pairings. Round 1 will begin as soon as deckbuilding ends. Round 2 will begin two minutes after the last match in Round 1 ends.


**Entry Options**:


* No entry requirement

**Prizes**:


* 2 wins: 1 Treasure Chest
* 1 win: 1 Player Rewards Pack

Pioneer on *Magic Online*

*Masters Edition II* Encore Draft October 23
--------------------------------------------


Beginning tomorrow, October 23, and running until next Wednesday, October 30, you can draft *Masters Edition II*. And just like the *Masters Edition* draft two weeks earlier, it's using the original Draft style: this is non-Phantom. When you draft these cards, they're added to your collection. Entry options are 12 Event Tickets, 3 *Masters Edition II* boosters plus 2 Event Tickets, or 120 Play Points.


For weeks listed in the [Alternative Play Calendar from Alli's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo/throne-eldraine-magic-online-edition-2019-09-18#altplay) as non-Phantom events, this League will begin at approximately 10 a.m. PT on the first day listed, which is always a Wednesday. These Leagues will be closed to new entries at 10 a.m. PT on the last day listed and ended no later than 2 p.m. that same day.

*Innistrad* Flashback Draft October 30
--------------------------------------


To celebrate Halloween, players can enjoy frightful fights in the upcoming *Innistrad* Flashback Draft! Get in on all the spooky action starting Wednesday, October 30. *Innistrad* Flashback Draft runs through November 6, so you'll have plenty of time to enjoy the creepiest of creatures.
