The math is simple for the competitors at Table 3 - Win 'em all and you're in the Top 8, anything less and you're out. 


Pack 1:  

NW - [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest)  

JF - [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot)  

FC - [Morbid Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger)  

EF - [Rabid Elephant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rabid+Elephant)  

FD - [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger)  

TH - [Muscle Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst)/[Nimble Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose)  

JP - [Aura Graft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aura+Graft)/[Seafloor Debris](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seafloor+Debris)  

NH - [Pardic Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Firecat)/[Last Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Rites)


Pack 2:  

JF - [Mystic Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Enforcer)  

FC - [Aven Fisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fisher)  

EF - [Flame Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Burst)  

FD - [Diligent Farmhand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diligent+Farmhand) (a mistake, as Froehlich to his right and Hovi to his left were both Green)  

TH - [Krosan Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Avenger)  

JP - [Deluge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deluge+)   

NH - [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog)  

NW - [Steamclaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steamclaw)/[Timberland Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberland+Ruins)


Pack 3:  

FC - [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) (Yes, Franck Canu actually followed up [Morbid Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger) and [Aven Fisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fisher) with [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear). This set the stage for what I can only guess will be a 3-color special with Sealed Deck mana.)  

EF - [Springing Tiger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springing+Tiger)  

FD - [Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter)  

TH - [Dirty Wererat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat)/[Morgue Theft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morgue+Theft). Tommi attempts to make Black his second color downstream from Dato's [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger).  

JP - [Gallantry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gallantry)  

NH - [Crypt Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Creeper)/[Zombify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify)  

NW - [Blazing Salvo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Salvo)


Pack 4:  

EF - [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)  

FD - [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst). Dato wisely abandons the Farmhand from Pack 2.  

TH - [Nantuko Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Disciple)  

JP - [Cephalid Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Scout)  

NH - [Frightcrawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightcrawler)  

NW - [Anarchist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist). Weil seems to want Red as his second color, despite Herzog to his right.  

JF - [Embolden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embolden)/[Angelic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall)  

FC - [Infected Vermin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infected+Vermin)/[Whispering Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Shade)


Pack 5:  

FD - [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise)  

TH - [Nantuko Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Disciple)  

JP - [Nomad Decoy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomad+Decoy)  

NH - [Springing Tiger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springing+Tiger) (Herzog takes his first Green card over [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood); it would be his only green card)  

NW - [Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) (Weil is starting to think Blue, though in fairness the pack had no Red)  

JF - [Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter)


Pack 6 featured little of note other than Canu's questionable choice of [Famished Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Famished+Ghoul) over the highly underrated [Sadistic Hypnotist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sadistic+Hypnotist), while Pack 7 saw Fung choose [Mystic Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Visionary) over [Kirtar's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kirtar%27s+Desire) (signaling an aggressive U/W strategy) and Canu sinking further into 3-color with [Chatter of the Squirrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chatter+of+the+Squirrel). The last of the first set of packs gave Noah Weil a 2nd pick [Cephalid Retainer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Retainer), solidifying his abandonment of Red in favor of heavy Blue.


As the draft direction switched, Nicolai Herzog opened his second consecutive [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise), while Justin Polin got [Iridescent Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iridescent+Angel), one of the best possible win conditions for slow Blue/White. Franck Canu took 6th pick [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) over [Still Life](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Still+Life), signaling he hadn't abandoned Blue and was still thinking 3-color. The next pack gave Polin a Broken Broker, Hovi a [Thermal Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermal+Blast) (he would abandon Black entirely in favor of Red), and Dato a Looter. Franck Canu got a much-needed [Darkwater Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkwater+Egg) but had to pass a [Dreamwinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder) to get it.


The third set of packs is where things got crazy. In four consecutive packs, rare bombs were opened. Jeff Fung scored an Aboshan, Canu snagged a [Mortivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortivore), Froehlich busted a Kamahl, and Hovi opened a [Kirtar's Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kirtar%27s+Wrath) that he shipped to Polin.
