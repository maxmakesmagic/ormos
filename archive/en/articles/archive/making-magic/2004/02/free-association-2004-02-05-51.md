When we first started the Pro Tour, we had two major fears. One, we wouldn't be able to generate any interesting celebrities. And two, that the high level tournaments would prove that the game had more luck than we believed. We needn't have worried. The Pro Tour has more colorful celebrities than we could ever have hoped. And the tournaments have proven that **Magic** is less luck-based, not more.
