Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*  takes place May 16-18, 2014, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA; only the best will have what it takes to qualify for a spot. The Magic Online Pro Tour Journey into Nyx Qualifier season will consist of 16 events between December 7, 2013 and March 9, 2014. Prove yourself and cement your place at Pro Tour Journey into Nyx, all while basking in the cool, comfortable glow of your computer screen.


Beginning this season, we’ve made some changes to the Pro Tour Qualifiers to help distinguish **Magic Online** Pro Tour Qualifiers events from our regularly scheduled event offerings. While most Magic Online events have a relatively flat prize structures, Pro Tour Qualifiers will have a new, top-heavy prize structure to better represent their role in providing players the chance to play on Magic’s ultimate proving ground: the Pro Tour. And since the primary goal of the Pro Tour Qualifiers is to qualify people for Pro Tour, we have restructured our Pro Tour Qualifiers to payout prizes distributed more towards players who made—or were in contention to make—the Top 8 of the event. That means there will no longer be the need to play on for 11 rounds, only to be awarded 1 booster for your efforts.


For Constructed events, this redistribution of prizes will not remove any booster prizes, but only change which players will be receiving them. For Limited events, the entry fee will be raised to 40 tickets, and over 1500 boosters will be added to the prize structure. This more than doubles the boosters awarded in the previous Limited Pro Tour Qualifier prize structure. All players who make the Top 8 in Limited events will now also receive a full set of a current Magic Online release. In addition, all Top 8 finishers in both Constructed and Limited events will receive 15 Qualifier Points.


The Pro Tour Challenge events for both Constructed and Limited have seen prize increases as well: An invite to the Pro Tour Challenge is still part of the prizes for the winner of the Pro Tour Qualifier; we have increased the prizes by $500 for the Pro Tour Challenge to $1500.
