### Marc Anderson


**Hometown (and local shop, if applicable):**  

Toronto, Heavy Support Games.


**Notable Finishes:**  

Hahahaha, yeah right...


**What did you play in Standard, and why?**  

Twin-Pod, because I'm terrible with control, and aggro loses to Timely Reinforcements.


**Did you do any tweaks on the archetype you played. If so, why? If not, why not?**  

I started with Aaron Nicall's list, made a ton of changes, then slowly gravitated back to close to what he built.


**Having played the swiss, is there anything you would change in your standard deck?**  

-1 Urabrask, the Hidden  

+1 Kazuul, Tyrant of the Cliffs


**Did you have any plans for m12 Limited? What's your preferred archetype? Is there anything you won't draft?**  

I prefer aggro, obviously, but I'm open to anything. Being open is better because people don't switch out of their first color as much in M12, as there are lots of fringe playables.


**What decks did you draft and what were your records with them?**  

Blue-Red first, 3-0, a sick deck with Chandra, Lavamancer, and Mind Control  

White-Black second, 3-0, a pile with two Day of Judgment and lots of filler.


**What's the worst card you played in your draft decks?**  

Zombie Goliath

### Ronald Be


**Hometown (and local shop, if applicable):**  

Montreal, Carta Magica


**Notable Finishes:**  

None.


**What did you play in Standard, and why?**  

Mono-Red, because I wanted to finish my rounds faster so I could recover between rounds.


**Did you do any tweaks on the archetype you played. If so, why? If not, why not?**  

I played Immolating Souleater to counteract Timely Reinforcements.


**Having played the swiss, is there anything you would change in your standard deck?**  

I don't like Manabarbs, but I don't know what I'd change it for.


**Did you have any plans for m12 Limited? What's your preferred archetype? Is there anything you won't draft?**  

Just take the best cards from every pack.


**What decks did you draft and what were your records with them?**  

I drafted Green-White Aura-Wolf (2-1) and Blue-Black Control (3-0)


**What's the worst card you played in your draft decks?**  

I don't remember, so I suppose they were all good.

### Mani Davoudi


**Hometown (and local shop, if applicable):**  

Vancouver, BC


**Notable Finishes:**  

Top 8 SCG Seattle 2011, Day 2 Pro Tour Nagoya 2011


**What did you play in Standard, and why?**  

Caw-Blade. It's a great deck and I have a lot of experience with it.


**Did you do any tweaks on the archetype you played. If so, why? If not, why not?**  

Main deck Azure Mage. It's great in both the control and combo matchups, and is still a somewhat aggressive creature.


**Having played the swiss, is there anything you would change in your standard deck?**  

Not really, no.


**Did you have any plans for m12 Limited? What's your preferred archetype? Is there anything you won't draft?**  

Don't draft green, get passed good cards, follow non-green signals. Black-Red Bloothirst and Blue-White fliers are awesome.


**What decks did you draft and what were your records with them?**  

Black-Red Bloodthirst (1-2)  

Blue-White Fliers (3-0)


**What's the worst card you played in your draft decks?**  

Lightning Elemental?

### Dan Lanthier


**Hometown (and local shop, if applicable):**  

Ottawa


**Notable Finishes:**  

2008 National Champion, a PT Top 50, a GP Top 16 and a Top 32


**What did you play in Standard, and why?**  

Splinter Twin. It's good against most of the field, and gives your opponents a lot of chances to play poorly.


**Did you do any tweaks on the archetype you played. If so, why? If not, why not?**  

Started playing Spellskites to shore up the weak matchups (Blue-Black is playing more Doom Blades right now). Dragonmaster Outcast in the sideboard, probably the best alternate win condition right now.


**Having played the swiss, is there anything you would change in your standard deck?**  

I would probably cut the Twisted Image for a Dismember or a fourth Into the Roil.


**Did you have any plans for m12 Limited? What's your preferred archetype? Is there anything you won't draft?**  

Force red and get as many 2-drops as possible. Stay open to a second color and avoid green like the plague.


**What decks did you draft and what were your records with them?**  

Red-white (3-0)  

Red-White (1-2)


**What's the worst card you played in your draft decks?**  

Goblin Bangchuckers, but I did have two Goblin Chieftains.

### Noah Long


**Hometown (and local shop, if applicable):**  

Toronto


**Notable Finishes:**  

29th PT San Diego 2010, 77th Worlds 2010, Top 8 2010 Canadian Nationals


**What did you play in Standard, and why?**  

Valakut. I didn't test much and Pat Cox just won a recent SCG event with it, and wrote a great article about it, so I chose to follow his advice. Thanks Pat!


**Did you do any tweaks on the archetype you played. If so, why? If not, why not?**  

Nope. I played the updated list Pat put in his article.


**Having played the swiss, is there anything you would change in your standard deck?**  

Nope, it's very, VERY good.


**Did you have any plans for m12 Limited? What's your preferred archetype? Is there anything you won't draft?**  

I really try to stay out of green. If I open nothing but green, I try to pair it with white or blue.


**What decks did you draft and what were your records with them?**  

Black-Red Bloodthirst (2-1) Lost to a deck with Mind Control, Overrun and Fireball.  

Blue-White Tempo (3-0) I love this archetype, and had nothing but good cards in my deck.


**What's the worst card you played in your draft decks?**  

Probably Blood Seeker

### Paul MacKinnon


**Hometown (and local shop, if applicable):**  

Calgary, Broken City


**Notable Finishes:**  

Just a few PTQ Top 8's


**What did you play in Standard, and why?**  

Red Deck Wins. I have a lot of experience with the deck, thought I had a good build of it, and feel it is underrated.


**Did you do any tweaks on the archetype you played. If so, why? If not, why not?**  

Kargan Dragonlord and Spikeshot Elder are underplayed and very good. I didn't play Chandra's Phoenix or Furnace Scamp because I think they're bad.


**Having played the swiss, is there anything you would change in your standard deck?**  

I wish I had a fourth Dismember in the board over Manic Vandal. Maybe another Hero of Oxid Ridge or two also.


**Did you have any plans for m12 Limited? What's your preferred archetype? Is there anything you won't draft?**  

In all limited formats I like to be flexible and take the strongest cards I see.


**What decks did you draft and what were your records with them?**  

White-Red with double Fireball (2-1)  

Green-Red aggro (2-1)


**What's the worst card you played in your draft decks?**  

Roc Egg

### Jeremie Ross-Latour


**Hometown (and local shop, if applicable):**  

Montreal, Carta Magica


**Notable Finishes:**  

Top 8 MTGO Scars Release Championship  

1st Place MTGO PTQ  

1st Place MTGO Rise of the Eldrazi Release Championship


**What did you play in Standard, and why?**  

My homebrew, "Turn 4 Titan," because I love it when I find an idea that can work against the metagame.


**Did you do any tweaks on the archetype you played. If so, why? If not, why not?**  

N/A


**Having played the swiss, is there anything you would change in your standard deck?**  

Fewer Pyroclasms, as I encountered no aggro decks.


**Did you have any plans for m12 Limited? What's your preferred archetype? Is there anything you won't draft?**  

My plan was to draft 2x Gideon Jura - it worked! I usually prefer blue decks, but I stay open. As a matter of fact, I didn't draft blue this tournament.


**What decks did you draft and what were your records with them?**  

2x Gideon Jura (3-0)  

Black-Red undefined (2-1)


**What's the worst card you played in your draft decks?**  

Lightning Elemental.

**Hometown (and local shop, if applicable):**  

Manila, Philippines // Edmonton, Alberta


**Notable Finishes:**  

Top 17 Pro Tour Austin


**What did you play in Standard, and why?**  

Caw-Blade. It can beat any deck and I love Squadron Hawk


**Did you do any tweaks on the archetype you played. If so, why? If not, why not?**  

I added Elspeth Tirel for the mirror and against Blue-Black.


**Having played the swiss, is there anything you would change in your standard deck?**  

No.

Blue-Green-Red (2-1)  

Red-Green (2-1)
