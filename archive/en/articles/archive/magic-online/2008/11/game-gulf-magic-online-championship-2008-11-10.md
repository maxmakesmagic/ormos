### Participation Terms


Playing on another person's account, selling your account, etc. are all violations of these Official Rules. If you play in this Tournament, win, and expect to get a prize, be very, very sure you are on your own account. We do not recognize "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that adult has purchased.


Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for the Championship, players are not permitted to have more than 1 of their accounts entered in the Championship. Players are not permitted to have secondary accounts played by another person. If a player is discovered to have more than 1 account playing in the Championship before, during, or after the event, appropriate penalties will be applied (including disqualification from the event with no refund of product or event tickets). In such an event, Sponsor may select an alternative player in its sole discretion.


A list of all players that have qualified for the Championship will be maintained on the Wizards of the Coast web site, [www.wizards.com](http://www.wizards.com). Players will be registered into the Championship the morning of the next day after they qualified. It will be the player's responsibility to make sure that they have been properly entered into this Championship and are able to join it PRIOR to the start of the Championship. If a player is qualified and is unable to join the Championship, they will need to contact customer service to get this corrected.


If a player wins that is ineligible to play in DCI™-sanctioned tournaments (i.e. DCI suspended and/or a paid contractor), then the *Game in the Gulf* accommodation prizes will pass down to the player with the next best finish. The final Swiss standings will determine the difference between third and fourth place and the difference between fifth through eighth place, should that be necessary. In the above case, the ticket and booster pack prizes will not pass down.


In either of the above cases, the booster pack prizes will not pass down.


In order to remain eligible for Prizes, all qualified players **must** email mtgotournaments@wizards.com by Friday, December 5th, 2008 at 10:00 AM PDT with the following information: Full Legal Name, Full Address, Telephone number, and DCI Number. **Players must put their MTGO Username as the subject of the email**. (Account passwords will not be requested--never give your password to anyone.) *Please do not email unless you have already qualified for the Championship.* Do not send an email for another player or account, and do not have another person send the email for you.
