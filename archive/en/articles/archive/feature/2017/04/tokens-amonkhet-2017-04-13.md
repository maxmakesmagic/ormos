The Tokens of Amonkhet

 Nicholas Wolfram fell promptly in love with tabletop and video games when he was only two years old, and he has been writing about them since he figured out how words worked. Now he puts together words about Magic, which he started playing way back in 2000. 






We know you guys love tokens. And while we'd love to be able to say that this is why *Amonkhet* has more tokens than any set we've ever printed, the real reason is probably because we love tokens, too. So let's just say that the *official* reason is that embalm is an awesome mechanic that we didn't want to do without unique tokens.


Throughout the previews over the last two weeks (check out the [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/amonkhet) if you're behind), you've already seen more tokens than you normally would have because of how embalm works. But in case you missed them, here are the mummified token versions of the embalm creatures that we've already previewed:

Of course, we didn't want to show our entire mummified hand too soon, so we kept quite a few embalm creatures secret. Until today, that is. While you may not be able to see all of these in their full glory until tomorrow, you can at least get a taste of them today. And some of them look pretty tasty (I'm looking at you, Aven Wind Guide).

This may seem like a lot of tokes so far (because it is), but that doesn't mean we're done yet. I wasn't lying when I said *Amonkhet* had more tokens than any other set we've ever made. And as you may recall, some of those tokens are double-sided tokens that contain multiple tokens because we've always wanted to make tokens that have tokens in them. Tokens.

But for you purists, we have the standard creature tokens from the set (including the Cat and Hippo tokens that you probably opened this article to see).

Finally, *Amonkhet* has one emblem to bring the total token count up to a robust 26.

We hope that you're as excited as we are to start gathering up as many of these tokens as you can! Remember: all of these will be available in *Amonkhet* packs, and your first opportunity to crack a pack will be at a [Prerelease](http://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/prerelease) on April 22â€“23, so [talk to your local store](http://locator.wizards.com/) and make sure they save you a spot!
