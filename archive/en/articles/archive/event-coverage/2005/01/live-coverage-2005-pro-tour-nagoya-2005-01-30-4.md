After starting out 9-0, Sweden's Anton Jonsson made it into the Top 8 by the skin of his teeth, but he managed to dispatch Masashiro Kuroda in the quarterfinals 3-1 to give him his third semifinals berth in the last three Limited tournaments. Teenage Malaysian sensation Terry Soh also roughed up quarterfinals opponent Frank Karsten 3-1, setting up this blue-red vs. black-red matchup. Soh's deck doesn't have any spectacular creatures, but it is removal heavy, something most Limited players prefer if given the choice between lots of removal and bombs. Jonsson's deck is a few cards short of spectacular as well, but he's played solid blue-red decks like this all weekend long and has done very well with it, so there's little reason to expect otherwise here. ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptnag05/sf2_1.jpg)*Jonsson and Soh had both made Top 8s before.*


### Game 1


Jonsson mulliganned his first hand and chose to keep a six-card hand with two [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s and some spells. Jonsson missed his third land drop, but found it a turn later with another [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) -- acceptable, but not useful in casting the [River Kaijin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Kaijin). Soh played a turn-two [Cruel Deceiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Deceiver) and then watched as Jonsson used [Yamabushi's Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yamabushi%27s+Flame) on [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre), [Scuttling Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scuttling+Death), and [Cursed Ronin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Ronin). Jonsson finally ran out of removal for Soh's dudes and took some damage from the Deceiver and [Akki Avalanchers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akki+Avalanchers).


Jonsson gave a wry smile when he bounced [Akki Avalanchers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akki+Avalanchers) back to Soh's hand before casting [Ronin Houndmaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ronin+Houndmaster). Smithers (as the Houndmaster is often referred to) died to [Rend Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rend+Flesh) and Jonsson's deck ran out of gas, letting Soh push enough damage for the win in spite of a [Mystic Restraints](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Restraints) on his [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba).


Soh 1, Jonsson 0


Jonsson sideboarded out [Eye of Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Nowhere) and [Battle-Mad Ronin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle-Mad+Ronin) for [Hisoka's Defiance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hisoka%27s+Defiance) and [Guardian of Solitude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardian+of+Solitude).


### Game 2


Jonsson's hand for Game 2 was much better, giving him [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami) and [River Kaijin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Kaijin) plus a [Yamabushi's Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yamabushi%27s+Flame) and plenty of land. Flame took out Soh's [Brutal Deceiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Deceiver), letting Jonsson go on the attack for the first time in the match. Another Flame removed [Gibbering Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gibbering+Kami) from the game, letting Anton bash unimpeded dropping Soh to 12. Soh cast [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague) on a fresh [Soratami Cloudskater](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soratami+Cloudskater) from Jonsson, and then cast [Cursed Ronin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Ronin), giving him an able-bodied blocker to play some defense. Jonsson's plan shifted slightly from pushing through damage to overwhelming Soh with bodies, playing two Guardians of Solitude and [Ronin Houndmaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ronin+Houndmaster) on consecutive turns.


Soh finally began to stabilize while still sitting at a healthy ten life, dropping [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre) and [Cruel Deceiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Deceiver) to keep his [Cursed Ronin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Ronin) company. [Kami of Fire's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Fire%27s+Roar) let Jonsson make two temporary two-power fliers, but [Rend Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rend+Flesh) made sure [Ronin Houndmaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ronin+Houndmaster) missed his connecting flight. Soh then cast [Kami of Lunacy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Lunacy) on his turn, giving him blockers on both land and air, provided Jonsson's [Kami of Fire's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Fire%27s+Roar) didn't put a wrench in the works. [Reach through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+through+Mists) from Jonsson did exactly that, letting Anton attack for four more, putting him four points away from evening the match. [Mystic Restraints](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Restraints) on [Kami of Lunacy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Lunacy) at the end of Soh's next turn finished the job.

### Game 3


Soh mulliganned for Game 3 while Jonsson kept a five-lander, but it had a two-drop and a four-drop, so at least he was assured of early action. [Guardian of Solitude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardian+of+Solitude) plus [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami) and [Kami of Fire's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Fire%27s+Roar) squared off against [Akki Avalanchers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akki+Avalanchers) and [Cursed Ronin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Ronin), a rather asynergistic combination for the young Malaysian. Soh's situation just got worse when Jonsson played [Teller of Tales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teller+of+Tales) and [Soratami Cloudskater](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soratami+Cloudskater) on consecutive turns. Jonsson used the Cloudskater ability to dig for a lucky arcane spell, in this case a [Reach through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+through+Mists), and attacked with the team, knocking Terry to five and pulled .


Jonsson 2, Soh 1


### Game 4


Jonsson kept a two-[Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) hand in Game 4 after just complaining about how his previous hands would have gone on much more poorly had he been playing on **Magic Online**, and then plucked an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) off the top of his deck like a champ. Soh's [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) was Flamed out of the game, but Soh had a very solid curve this game, following the Thief with [Gibbering Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gibbering+Kami) and [Scuttling Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scuttling+Death). Jonsson had a lot of action himself, playing a host of spirits and a [Ronin Houndmaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ronin+Houndmaster) while Soh appeared stuck for red mana. He eventually found a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and cast [Kami of Lunacy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Lunacy) to go along with his strictly offensive-minded [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre). Jonsson pushed more damage through with a first striking [Brutal Deceiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Deceiver) dropping Soh to eight, but Terry went on the counterattack on his turn, bashing away with [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre) and [Gibbering Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gibbering+Kami). [River Kaijin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Kaijin) blocked the Ogre, but the Kami got through putting Anton at fourteen.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptnag05/jsf1_2.jpg)*Soh's second Top 8 found him in the semifinals.*
[Guardian of Solitude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardian+of+Solitude) made sure Soh's [Kami of Fire's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Fire%27s+Roar) would stay out of combat, as Anton swung remorsely with his men dropping Terry to three, trading while Anton's KoFR for the flying lunatic spirit. Soh wasn't about to give up without a fight though, casting Scuttles and [Akki Avalanchers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akki+Avalanchers) to try and buy some more time, and then attacking with [Kami of Fire's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Fire%27s+Roar), the Ogre, and [Gibbering Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gibbering+Kami) putting himself back in the game. Jonsson chose not to attack on his own turn, casting [Soratami Rainshaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soratami+Rainshaper) before passing the turn back.


Soh cast [Pain Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain+Kami), and the match literally stopped for ten minutes as he and Jonsson tried to figure out how combat would play out without actually doing any attacking. Eventually Soh figured out that Smithers was the proper "cannot block" target and Jonsson chose not to use the Rainshaper to negate the KoFR's ability, but incredibly, after all of that, Soh simply chose to pass the turn without attacking. Jonsson did the same on his turn, and then cast [Mystic Restraints](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Restraints) on Soh's [Gibbering Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gibbering+Kami) before Soh declared attackers.


Saying the pace of play was glacial at this point would be an injustice to how fast glaciers actually move. I'd like to take this time to give shout-outs to my peeps in the hood, tell my mom hi and... wait, the judge just have Terry a warning for slow play, so perhaps we'll see things move along now. This set Terry off, as the formerly quiet and polite kid turned into a raging maniac, tipping over the table, pushing the judge and . . .


Okay, that was just me, daydreaming after Soh pushed all his remaining men into the red zone while I waited for Anton to figure out how blocks were going down. I promise to stay focused for the rest of this match, honest.


Smithers blocked the KoFR, [Brutal Deceiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Deceiver) blocked Scuttles, [Guardian of Solitude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardian+of+Solitude) stepped in front of the Avalanchers, [River Kaijin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Kaijin) stopped the Ogre, and [Pain Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain+Kami) was left to do his dirty by himself down on the end. The players stacked damage. Soh then sacrificed Scuttles to try and take out Anton's Rainshaper that was sitting on the sidelines, but Jonsson used the Rainshaper's power to protect itself, forcing Soh to cast [Yamabushi's Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yamabushi%27s+Flame) on it in response to kill the flier. Because Jonsson's blocks were perfect, he left Soh with no outs and was able to attack back for exactly three, earning his first Pro Tour finals appearance.
