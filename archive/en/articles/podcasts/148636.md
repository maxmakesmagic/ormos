**SEPTEMBER EPISODE**


* **Magic** art director and *Time Spiral* concept illustrator Jeremy Jarvis discusses crafting the visual style of the post-apocalyptic *Time Spiral*world. **Magic**hasn't been back to Dominaria for quite some time, and it's a very different place now. Included in the enhanced iTunes version of this podcast are several exclusive images from the style guide, along with more than a dozen final art pieces from the set.
* Who better to talk about making *Time Spiral* than head designer Mark Rosewater? Mark brings to light the philosophy behind a nostalgia block, what challenges design and development faced by bringing back elements of **Magic**'s past, previews Magus of the Scroll (viewable in the enhanced iTunes version), and much more, all in Mark's unique style.
* This Month in **Magic** showcases the upcoming events, focusing on when and where *Time Spiral*will see action. That all starts with the [Prerelease Events on September 23-24](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/prerelease/timespiral), and continues with the Release Tournaments, two upcoming Grand Prix and then Pro Tour-Kobe.
