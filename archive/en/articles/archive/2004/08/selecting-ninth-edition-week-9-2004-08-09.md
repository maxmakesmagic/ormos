Last Week’s [Selecting *Ninth Edition*](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/selecting9e/home) card vote was between the hasty Viashino beaters and this time it was the smaller guy that won out, with almost twice the votes of his beefier competitor.

### Card Vote #9


For this week’s card vote it’s a duel between two heavy hitters, [Hammer of Bogardan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammer+of+Bogardan) and [Shard Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix). Both are powerful cards with significant tournament experience on their resume. Both bring great late game options to their decks thanks to their ability to be returned from the graveyard. [Hammer of Bogardan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammer+of+Bogardan) has made it into two previous core sets (*Sixth Edition* and *Eighth Edition*) while [Shard Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Phoenix) is looking to make its first appearance outside of *Stronghold*. Make sure to vote for your favorite and we’ll let you know the results next week!
