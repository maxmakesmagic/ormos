Shaun McLaren
=============


**Age:** 26  



**What Constructed deck are you playing and why?** Jeskai Wins (Aggro? Tempo? Burn? Control?). Because [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) is very powerful.


**What card was your MVP this weekend?** [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). I love to dig.


**What *Khans of Tarkir* cards that you're NOT playing were you most impressed with this weekend?**  [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)â€”that card is just a nightmare.


**What decks did you draft? What did you think of each deck?** Black-Greensplashing white and blue for [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), [Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast), and [Sagu Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sagu+Mauler). Deck was amazing, the bombs just crushed. Sultai Aggro. Solid, but had a hard time finding whether to be aggressive or controlling. (Also Durdle Turtle + [Kin-Tree Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Invocation))


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?** More fame, more fortune, more babes.


**Who did you prepare with?** Mostly a lone wolf, but I couldn't have done it without my brother. Thanks Dean!
