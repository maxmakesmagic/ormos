![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/807.jpg)Dustin wins the coin flip and chooses to go first. Dustin is playing a fast Red Black deck while Chris drafted a blue green deck with multiple fliers. Throughout the match both players remain fairly quiet, but very comfortable. There isn't any trash talking at all, but there is a little familiarity, both players having been Pro Tour and Grand Prix regulars. 


Stern's deck is full of combat tricks and cards that take advantage of Threshold. Over the course of the first game, Dustin [Acceptable Losses](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acceptable+Losses) one of Chris's creatures, losing an [Anarchist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist), then he [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger)s his [Anarchist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist), plays [Anarchist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist), retrieving [Acceptable Losses](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acceptable+Losses), then casts [Acceptable Losses](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acceptable+Losses) again on another of Chris's creatures. He also loses his [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) AND his [Anarchist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist) in combat, then [Morgue Theft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morgue+Theft)s back [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger)s his [Anarchist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist), but wins the game before casting [Anarchist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist) again with a [Frightcrawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightcrawler) that he cast early in the game after achieving Threshold.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/805.jpg)For the second game, Chris decides to play. Chris comes out strong with a good curve for [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear), [Cephalid Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Scout), [Treetop Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Sentinel) (pro green). Dustin [Acceptable Losses](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acceptable+Losses) the Sentinel, losing a Swamp. Chris then enchants his Cephalid with [Seton's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Desire). Dustin sees this 3/3 Flier as a big threat, so he attacks with his [Crypt Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Creeper) (all of Chris's creatures are tapped from attacking), then after combat sacrifices it to remove a card from Pikula's graveyard to put 3 cards in his own graveyard. Dustin then [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise)s for 3, targeting the enchanted Cephalid.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/806.jpg)Chris goes on to cast two [Dreamwinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder)s to put pressure on Stern. Stern makes a couple of questionable attacks, losing a couple of creatures. This, however, puts him past Threshold, which in turn makes his [Shower of Coals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shower+of+Coals) VERY GOOD. Stern kills both of Pikula's [Dreamwinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder)s and deals Pikula 4 damage, then attacks for the win the following turn.


Dustin Stern-2, Christopher Pikula-0
