Coming into day 2 there were 4 undefeated players. Thanks to a draw between two of them, at the end of round 10 there were three. Makihito Mihara sat at 10-0 in the feature match area to face off against 9-0-1 Gao Zhen Xing


While the former World Champion played a Black-Green deck yesterday in sealed, in the first booster draft of Grand Prix Beijing Makihito Mihara assembled a White-Black spirit deck. Flying creatures backed up by removal is always a winning strategy; Mihara had access to [Sinister Concoction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinister+Concoction), [Apothecary Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Apothecary+Geist), and a pair of [Topplegeist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topplegeist)s.


While not a former World Champion, Mihara's opponent, Gao Zhen Xing, was no slouch to competitive *Magic*. With two Grand Prix Top 8s in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur the game designer from Beijing crafted a White-Black-Green Humans deck. His show stoppers included [Sigarda, Heron's Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigarda%2C+Heron%27s+Grace), [Always Watching](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Always+Watching), and [Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone).


The Games
=========


The first game started with both players playing out creatures: [Wicker Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicker+Witch), [Thraben Inspector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Inspector) and [Emissary of the Sleepless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emissary+of+the+Sleepless) for Mihara and [Cathar's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathar%27s+Companion) and [Harvest Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harvest+Hand) for Gao.


When Gao attacked with his [Cathar's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathar%27s+Companion), Mihara blocked; Gao was quick to use [Throttle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throttle) to two-for-one the former world champion.

*Gao Zhen Xing*


Mihara cast [Apothecary Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Apothecary+Geist) and used his [Dauntless Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Cathar) to get a 1/1 spirit token. Armed with the flyers, he was finally able to force some damage through.


The next big play from Gao was [Sigarda, Heron's Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigarda%2C+Heron%27s+Grace). Immediately, Mihara answered it with [Sinister Concoction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinister+Concoction).

By this point Mihara's flyers had dropped Gao down to 8. Gao found a Watcher of the Web, but Mihara found a [Topplegeist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topplegeist) to keep the spider at bay.


Mihara dropped Gao to 2 before Gao was able to remove the spirit with [Dead Weight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+Weight). From there Gao cast [Always Watching](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Always+Watching) and looked to stabilize. Unfortunately for Gao, Mihara was able to find a second copy of [Topplegeist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topplegeist) and take the first game.


**Mihara 1 â€“ 0 Gao**


As if a continuation from the previous game, Mihara started game two with a pair of [Topplegeist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topplegeist)s. Mihara followed the spirits up with an [Apothecary Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Apothecary+Geist) and was able to drop Gao down to 13. Gao's first play was [Vessel of Ephemera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vessel+of+Ephemera).

*Makihito Mihara*


With Gao stuck on 3 lands, Mihara used [Tooth Collector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+Collector) to deal with Gao's Spirit token. Without blockers, Mihara was able to continue beating Gao down in the air. Without access to a fourth land, Gao fell to Mihara a couple turns later.


**Makihito Mihara defeats Gao Zhen Xing to remain the only 11-0 at Grand Prix Beijing!**
