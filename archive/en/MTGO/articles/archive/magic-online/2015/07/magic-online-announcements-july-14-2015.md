***Magic Online* Collection Performance Upgrades Coming July 15**


We're happy to announce that the Collection Performance Upgrade that we had to delay last week will be rolling out this Wednesday, July 15, during the *Magic Online* downtime.


We have made a number of behind-the-scenes changes designed to improve the speed, efficiency, and accuracy of *Magic Online*. These changes have several practical benefits, many of which help reduce the amount of time you have to spend waiting for *Magic Online* to respond. There are three main changes that you should see immediately.


1. Log in time is greatly reduced. That means if you get disconnected during a draft or a game, you’ll be able to rejoin the action faster!
  
3. Moving large groups of cards is much smoother. Practically, this lets you create massive trade binders or organize a large collection with less headache.
  
5. We have reduced many cases where a “Waiting for Main Navigation” message or a crash would occur due to memory or performance issues.

There are a few other changes that we’d like to highlight as well:


* We have improved our performance when moving, sorting, and filtering cards for display. *Magic Online* should remain responsive while these actions occur. If there is a delay, it will be indicated by a momentary light grey overlay.
* We have updated of a number of error messages that might display while navigating your collection to make these errors more helpful.
* We no longer pop up a progress bar while waiting for deck, collection, or active trade binder synchronization to the server to complete.
* It is not necessary to clear binders between trades and re-add items.

Accompanying these changes are three Known Issues that we would like to specifically highlight:


1. If you add cards to a trade using the Wish List, and then right click that card and select a “Add X to Trade” option, *Magic Online* crashes. Note that this crash only occurs if you use both the Wish List and the “Add X to Trade” option in the same trade; using only one or the other will not crash *Magic Online*. **We plan to have this fixed with the 7/22 downtime.**
  
3. If you attempt to add cards to a binder so that the binder would have more than 50,000 cards, exactly enough cards will be added to reach 50,000 though an error message will display telling you to decrease the number of cards and try again.
  
5. In some scenarios, while trading, using the Search tool to import a deck causes *Magic Online* to crash.
