TOP 8 COVERAGE
--------------


Saturday morning, 1345 players came to Ottawa with hopes of being crowned Grand Prix Ottawa Champion. After nine rounds of *Khans of Tarkir* Sealed Deck, the field was reduced to just 150 players. 


The remaining players returned for six rounds of *Khans of Tarkir* Draft. The *Khans of Tarkir* Draft format continues to cement itself as one of the most skill-intensive Limited formats in quite some time. The dust settled and only eight remained: (16) Shahar Shenhar, (14) Sam Black, Jessica Buchanan, Seth Manfield, Neil Oliver, Xavier Allegrucci, Lucas Siow, and Pascal Maynard were the last eight standing. 


Seth Manfield won a tight three games against Jessica Buchanan in the quarterfinals, steamrolled Lucas Siow in the semifinals, and made short work of Neil Oliver in the finals. Trumpet Blast, Jeering Instigator, and Barrage of Boulders allowed Manfield to win games seemingly out of nowhere time after time. Seth Manfield is your Grand Prix Ottawa Champion!
