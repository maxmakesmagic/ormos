Before Thursday's utter carnage in the Modern format, the Community Team toured the Wizards of the Coast building.

*How sweet! The Community Team got Mike Robles a birthday gift!* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*I was wrong. This is sweet!* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*There is sweet stuff located all throughout the WotC offices. This is a display just outside the reception desk on the fourth floor.* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
**Magic* in a bottle?! Delicious!* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Checking out the dragon guarding the fourth floor spawned a decently long discussion about just how the heck it got in the building. Most people agree that they lured it in with promises of delicious cake.* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Imagine, if you will, Whiffy dressed up as the Jester. Three years running, people just thought he was dressing up as a clown for Halloween.* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*This is like the Vatican of Wizards.* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Check out the sick contents of Mike Robles's desk! An you name all the gamer memorabilia?* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*The things discussed at the WotC offices are nothing if not important!* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Sometimes, you just want to hang with the Rock. Actually, always you just wat to hang out with the Rock.* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*We've definitely added a few more years to this! Thanks for all your support, *Magic* Community!* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*This is where the players check out the player psychographics on the wall and try to figure out where they lie.* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*I think we found the right one for LSV.* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*The Community Team gets a glance inside one of the War Rooms in the Pit. What cool future information are they going to come back with?* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Behold, the future of *Magic*.* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Oh look! It's new R&D intern Billy Moreno!* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*And it's the Dave twins, Humphreys and Guskin!* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Mark Globus don't want no scrubs.* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Needless to say, R&D did not get a love note from Giant Growth.* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*One last moment with the guys who make the cards before we head off on our tour!* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Mark Globus, *Magic* Senior Producer, and our tour guide through the infamous Pit.* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*People always seem to love to check out the uncut Beta sheet, mostly because it's gorgeous!* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*I mean seriously, look at this rare sheet!* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Whiffy taking some pictures with his new babies.* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Everyone really seemed to enjoy their trip through the Digital Games department! I wonder why...* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Oh hai, Worth! Worth Wollpert, in addition to facing off against the Community later in the day, was part of the team that answered all the questions the Commuity had about *Magic* Online.*  |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Getting a nice group shot in front of the dragon has become a tradition at the Community Cup. Thankfully, no one was eaten.* |







|  |
| --- |
| 
*Um...nevermind.* |
