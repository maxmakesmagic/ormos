Introducing Historic Anthology 6 and Explorer Anthology 1!
==========================================================


Historic and Explorer formats are getting new bundles of awesome cards with the release of Historic Anthology 6 and Explorer Anthology 1!


Available July 28 until October 5 for 4,000 gems or 25,000 gold, each bundle contains four copies of 20 powerful, iconic, and popular cards that open up new deck-building options.


For a taste of what you'll find in each, check out these teaser cards!


Historic Anthology 6
--------------------

As this is our first Historic Anthology drop since the arrival of Alchemy, we want to affirm what [we stated back in December](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/alchemy-rebalancing-philosophy-2021-12-02): we will not be rebalancing iconic cards that have a significant history behind them. If these cards cause issues, we will look to address them ***indirectly*** through live balancing or ban them if necessary.


Explorer Anthology 1

This Weekend: Final July Qualifier Play-In and Qualifier Weekend
================================================================


This weekend is packed with Premier Play events! Starting Friday, July 22, the [Qualifier Play-In event](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-play-in) is your last chance to compete for an invitation to the July Qualifier Weekend. The format is *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* Phantom Sealed in Best-of-Three matches.


Then, it's the main event: the [July Qualifier Weekend](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend)! Kicking off on Saturday, July 23, and continuing until Sunday, July 24, this is where the best face off to determine who gets an invitation to the pinnacle of *MTG Arena* competitive play, the [Arena Championship](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-premier-play-2022-04-21)!


The entry window for both Qualifier Weekend days' events is 6 a.m. PT (13:00 UTC) until 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC) when signup locks—so don't be late! The format for both days is *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* Phantom Sealed in Best-of-Three matches.


Arena Open with a Twist
=======================


[This month's Arena Open, happening July 30–31](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/july-2022-arena-open-alchemy-horizons-baldurs-gate-limited-2022-07-20), comes with a new twist. In past Limited Arena Opens, players who made it to Day 2 would draft a single deck, and then play up to nine full matches with it. Although Day 2 is expected to be an intense competition, this many games with a single draft deck made the experience more of a repetitive grind.


To give Day 2 players more potential variety throughout the day, we are changing the structure of this month's Arena Open Day 2.


* As before, all Day 2 players will draft at the beginning of the day. **The entry period for Draft One is the usual 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. PT (13:00–15:00 UTC)**. Players will then have until 12 p.m. PT (19:00 UTC) to earn up to three match wins with that deck or be eliminated after a match loss.
* Then, all surviving players will draft a second time. The entry period for Draft Two is from **12 p.m. to 2 p.m. PT (19:00–21:00 UTC)**. Players will have until 6 p.m. PT (01:00 UTC, August 1) to earn up to three more match wins or be eliminated after a match loss.  
**Earning even a single win in Draft Two will be enough for a cash prize** **and an invitation to the** [**August 20–21 Qualifier Weekend**](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend)**!**

The full prize structure for Day 2 is now:





| **Day 2, Draft One:*Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* Player Draft (Best-of-Three)** |
| --- |
| 3 Wins | Day 2 Draft Two invitation |
| 2 Wins | 5,000 gems |
| 1 Win | 2,500 gems |
| 0 Wins | 500 gems |





| **Day 2, Draft Two:*Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* Player Draft (Best-of-Three)** |
| --- |
| 3 Wins | $2,500 + Qualifier Weekend invitation |
| 2 Wins | $2,000 + Qualifier Weekend invitation |
| 1 Win | $1,000 + Qualifier Weekend invitation |
| 0 Wins | 20,000 gems |


Effectively, instead of playing to eight match wins or two match losses, players will now play to six match wins or one match loss, with a new draft after the first three rounds.


This new structure puts extra emphasis on drafting ability, since a single deck will not be able to carry you through the entire day, and it gives players some variety in their decks throughout the day. It also shortens the path to the cash prizes, although with less room for missteps.


We hope that this makes for a more robust competition experience, and we look forward to hearing how it works out for players.
