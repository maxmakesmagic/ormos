Sultai Whip and Abzan Midrange are both solid deck choices for a Grand Prix and huge chunk of players have chosen these consistent and powerful deck as their weapon. But what if you can't make up your mind? Play both, like this player is doing!

Why so serious? This creative player attempts a [Fires of Yavimaya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fires+of+Yavimaya) creation. The Joker will demonstrate to you that things are about to get real crazy when [Temur Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Ascendancy) is in play. Presumably, [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater), [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix) and [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) should be in this Temur Monsters deck as well.

Pictured is three-time Pro Tour competitor Lee Shi Tian executing the killing blow with his signature [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) deck. Fellow Team MTG Mint Card Platinum Pro, Nam Sung Wook and many others are also following his footsteps in an attempt to prey on the sea of removal-light green decks here in Manila.

Little red men charge into the red zone. Boss Sligh was spotted dominating a couple of top tables and it is hard to resist the allure of turn four kills.

One of the most interesting brews witnessed in action was this Jeskai “Affinity” deck. The deck dishes out early damage with with [Ensoul Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensoul+Artifact), [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider), [Ghostfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostfire) Blade and seals the game with fiery spells such as [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) and [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm).
