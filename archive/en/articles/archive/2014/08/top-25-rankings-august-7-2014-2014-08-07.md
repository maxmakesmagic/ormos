The 2013–2014 season is over, and we have our final Magic Top 25 Pro Rankings from it, showing Frenchman Jérémy Dezani claiming the [Player of the Year](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptm15/poty) title with a mighty 86 Pro Points. Reid Duke entered [Pro Tour *Magic 2015*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptm15) as No. 1 by the smallest of margins, but a tough Day One saw him fall in the final table to No. 3. Bracketing him are his two best friends in the game, William Jensen (No. 4) and Owen Turtenwald (No. 2), both of whom reached the Top 8. For Jensen, it was validation after a season of Grand Prix dominance (eight Top 8s) that lacked a standout performance at the highest level of all. His fifth Pro Tour Top 8 may be the sweetest yet.


Unsurprisingly, the highest new entry was the Pro Tour Champion, Ivan Floch, who enters at No. 5, just ahead of his European near-neighbor Stanislav Cifka. Defending Player of the Year Josh Utter-Leyton battled valiantly to keep his crown, finishing tied at No. 8 on the year with Tom Martell. There were excellent performances from Martin Juza, Yuuki Ichikawa, and Patrick Dickmann, all of whom entered the Top 25 in this final week of the season, while Sung Wook Nam and Pierre Dagen lost their ranking, at least for now.


So, with the next season of Magic awesomeness set to begin this weekend at Grand Prix in Portland and Utrecht, the Top 25 shows thirteen Americans, seven Europeans, three Canadians, and three from Asia-Pacific. A phenomenal season comes to a close, and it does so with Jérémy Dezani the 2013–2014 Player of the Year, and our official No. 1-ranked player in the world.
