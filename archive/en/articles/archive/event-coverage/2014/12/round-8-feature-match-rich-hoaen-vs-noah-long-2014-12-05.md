"It's a good thing you featured me now, because I'm not winning today."


Such boundless optimism is Rich Hoaen's bread and butter. This round he expected defeat from the man sitting across from him, Noah Long, who Top 8'd last year's Nationals in Montreal.


### Game One


Long won the roll and chose to play. His turn-two [Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) was pressured by [Tormented Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Soul) and [Runeclaw Bear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) on the other side of the table. He Looted away [Frost Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath) and played [Griffin Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Rider). Hoaen hit for three and played [Lurking Crocodile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Crocodile), but Long was quick to [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) it.

*Rich Hoaen* |



Long untapped and cast [Griffin Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel), supercharging his [Griffin Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Rider). He attacked for five. Hoaen attacked back and Long refused to put his Griffin in jeopardy. Hoaen re-cast his Crocodile and passed without playing a fourth land. Long sent it home with [Ã†ther Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) and hit for six.


Hoaen shrugged and made the same play again. "[Frost Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath) me?"


Long did a quick count. "Actually..." He turned over Guardian's Pledge. Hoaen packed up his cards.


Long 1 - Hoaen 0


### Game Two


Hoaen chose to play and led off with three swamps. Long, meanwhile, powered out [Armored Warhorse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Warhorse) and [Benalish Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Veteran). [Blood Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Seeker) showed up a turn late, and before Hoaen knew it he was down to thirteen.

*Noah Long* |



Long summoned [Azure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Mage), giving Hoaen a target for his [Wring Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh). Hoaen untapped and attacked, still without any action. Long hit again and summoned [Peregrine Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Griffin). Finally, Hoaen drew a forest, enabling [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider). Unfortunately, it was too late. [Frost Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath) from Long locked up the game.


**Noah Long defeats Rich Hoaen 2-0**
