Progress Update
===============


Bugs are being squashed as we continue to work on issues you've reported. Tomorrow's release will have more fixes, including these:


* Fix for a bug in which [Grafted Identity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafted+Identity) has the wrong art
* Fix for a bug where dragging a card while viewing the battlefield from a card prompt browser creates a soft lock
* Fix for a bug that prevents some Limited decks from being edited after initial deck submission

If you become stuck in the deck-building state, please follow this link to [contact customer service](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000317092) and complete the form after selecting "Report a problem in your event" from the dropdown.
