*Do you have any special rituals when you open a pack? Rare first or rare last?*

![Kelly Digges](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** My preferred "ritual" is playing Limited—Draft, Sealed Deck, Winston Draft, Pack Wars, anything but just ripping the pack open.

The group I drafted with the most was fond of "popping" the pack (loosening the foil wrapper enough to create a little bubble, then slapping the pack to pop the bubble). I never got the hang of it, and eventually I stopped trying because I looked silly.

I was, however, always known around my playgroup for loving the smell of a freshly opened booster pack. I would open my first pack of a draft, and before I even looked at my cards, I'd take a good huff of the wrapper. That starts a draft off right—it's a good familiar smell, and it makes your head spin a little. I always claimed that I could tell the difference between different sets by their scent, but nobody ever put me to a blind sniff test. Probably for the best.

Oh, and about the rare? Last, always.
