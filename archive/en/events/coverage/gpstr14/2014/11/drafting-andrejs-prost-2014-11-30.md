The captain of the Latvian national team was one of the many World *Magic* Cup competitors to make a stop at this Grand Prix before heading to Nice next week. Currently residing in the United States, Prost had of course all the more reason to make the most of his long-distance trip—and he was, starting the Grand Prix with an impressive 11-1.


Now he only needed two more wins to turn that into his second career Grand Prix Top 8 (and match his two Pro Tour Top 8s). Obviously, to get there, he first needed to draft another strong deck.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpstr14/draft_prost1.jpg)*Andrejs Prost*




He began the draft by picking [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning) over [Swarm of Bloodflies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+of+Bloodflies) and a couple of common lands. Next was [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury) over [Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress) and [Mardu Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hordechief). He did get around to pick [Swarm of Bloodflies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+of+Bloodflies) third, and his fifth pick was [Jungle Hollow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Hollow), taken over [Longshot Squad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longshot+Squad) and [Dragonscale Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonscale+Boon).



Pick five marked a return to red, with [War-Name Aspirant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War-Name+Aspirant) over [Rite of the Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+the+Serpent) and [Sagu Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sagu+Archer). Then came [Bitter Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Revelation), then [Wind-Scarred Crag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wind-Scarred+Crag), and then [Wooded Foothills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Foothills) over a second [Bitter Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Revelation). He did get a second [Bitter Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Revelation) anyway as his ninth pick, and the rest of pack one gave him [Kin-Tree Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Warden), [Trumpet Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trumpet+Blast), [Heart-Piercer Bow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart-Piercer+Bow), [Barrage of Boulders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrage+of+Boulders), and [Firehoof Cavalry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firehoof+Cavalry).


At this point Prost mainly had black and red cards, basically leaving nowhere else to go but Mardu. However, in *Khans of Tarkir* draft you never really know. A deck based in red and black, though unlikely, was certainly not out of the question.


The second pack continued with a black first pick in [Ruthless Ripper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruthless+Ripper), which Prost chose over [Throttle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throttle) and [Chief of the Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chief+of+the+Edge). He finally did venture into white, however, taking a second-pick [Highspire Mantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highspire+Mantis) out of a booster which also had [Disowned Ancestor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disowned+Ancestor) and [Raiders' Spoils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raiders%27+Spoils). Next up was [Mardu Skullhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Skullhunter), eschewing yet another [Throttle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throttle), followed by [Leaping Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaping+Master) and [Mardu Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hordechief)—again passing [Throttle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throttle).


Delving into Mardu full throttle now, Prost next picked up [Bloodfell Caves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodfell+Caves), [Timely Hordemate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Hordemate), [Rush of Battle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rush+of+Battle), [Krumar Bond-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krumar+Bond-Kin), [Raiders' Spoils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raiders%27+Spoils). His final few cards in this round were [Erase](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erase), Unyielding Kumar, [Windstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windstorm), and [Siegecraft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siegecraft).


His first pick in pack three was another [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury) in favor of [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom)—a decision Prost would later come to regret—followed by [Take Up Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Take+Up+Arms) over [Mardu Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hordechief) and [Throttle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throttle). Pick three was [Chief of the Scale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chief+of+the+Scale) over [Arrow Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrow+Storm), pick four was [Ride Down](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ride+Down) over [Abzan Battle Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Battle+Priest), and pick five, for lack of options, was [Sage-Eye Harrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage-Eye+Harrier).


Black and white cards continued to come his way, though, with a pretty late [Swarm of Bloodflies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+of+Bloodflies), followed by [Feat of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feat+of+Resistance), and [Smite the Monstrous](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smite+the+Monstrous). Prost's final six picks of the draft, for the sake of completeness, were [Bloodfire Expert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodfire+Expert), [Krumar Bond-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krumar+Bond-Kin), [Rakshasa's Secret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa%27s+Secret), [Molting Snakeskin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molting+Snakeskin), [Kheru Dreadmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kheru+Dreadmaw), and [Taigam's Scheming](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taigam%27s+Scheming).


Prost ended up with a solid black-white deck splashing red. He wasn't entirely happy with how the draft had gone, both with a few of his own picks as well as some of the other drafters' apparent decisions, but stated: "I still got a good deck."
