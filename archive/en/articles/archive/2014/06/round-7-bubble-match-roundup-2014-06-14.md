The bubble here in Moscow might not be the biggest, as only 532 players are in attendance, and the amount of top level pros are far from GP Atlanta a few weeks back, where 17 out of the top 25 ranked players were in attendance. That doesn't mean that a few of the big names didn't have their backs against the wall in the 8th(!) and last round of the day.


**Alessandro Portaro (Esper Control) vs. Vitaly Korol (Black Devotion with Green)**

The young Italian, who has made a claim to fame lately not only by being a regular at the European Grand Prix circuit, but also by making the top 8 at 10 PTQs this year, without picking up the much desired invite to the Pro Tour.



The match that was make or break turned out to be a lot about [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s. In the first game Portaro held the Rat invasion at bay with an Elspeth, blocking with Soldiers until he could sweep the board with [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) and take over the game with [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation). In game two however a second turn [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) meant a quick demise for the Italian.


The third and deciding game was a race of [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) against first [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) and then multiple [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation). After drawing a massive number of cards and answering all of Korol's threats, two brothers in arms in the form of [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa) sealed the deal, and Day Two, for Portaro.


**Alessandro Portaro 2–1 Vitaly Korol**


**Trey van Cleave (Mono-Blue) vs Dimitriy Pavlov**

A named player who wasn't quite as lucky was Trey van Cleave, who despite valiantly having made the trip to Moscow saw his army of [Flying Men](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Men) being raced y multiple copies of [Nemesis of Mortals](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis+of+Mortals), while [Nyx Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyx+Weaver) held the ground and [Shadowborn Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowborn+Demon) showed up right on time in both games for a pretty lopsided victory.



**Dimitriy Pavlov 2–0 Trey van Cleave**
