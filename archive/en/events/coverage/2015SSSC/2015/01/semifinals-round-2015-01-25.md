The semifinals featured four players, from four different countries, playing four very different deck archetypes. While it took six rounds of Limited prowess to push these players into the playoffs, it was their Standard archetypes that would determine the outcome of this tournament.


Enough chatting, let's dive into what happened.


Oscar Christensen (R/G Monsters) vs. Jérémie Ross-Latour (Jeskai Ascendancy)
============================================================================


The first match to finish was the semifinal battle between Montreal's Jérémie Ross-Latour (piloting [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) combo) and Oscar Christensen of Denmark (piloting R/G Monsters).

A lack of any combo action from Ross-Latour allowed Christensen and his behemoths—led by the old khan [Yasova Dragonclaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yasova+Dragonclaw)—to trample over the competition in Game 1.

In the second game, while Ross-Latour had some fancy mana play with a morphed [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) to get multiple plays in a turn, the fast clock of Christensen was too fast. Yasova did her work again, ridding Ross-Latour of blockers at critical points to ensure lethal.


“Your clock is too fast,” Ross-Latour noted after the match, offering the handshake.


Dominik Prosek (B/G Constellation) vs. Luis Salvatto (R/W Midrange)
===================================================================


While Salvatto's R/W Midrange deck is capable of putting on some pressure, its clock was not the fastest that you are capable of in Standard, and a fast clock or graveyard disruption is a requirement against Prosek's B/G Constellation deck, which has access to the utterly brutal combination of [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) and [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos).

In fact, it was those two cards that put Prosek ahead in the first game, and a second [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) that hit the bin via [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) that earned an immediate concession from Salvatto.


In the second game, Salvatto took an aggressive route and aced past Prosek's Pharika, God of [Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Affliction) thanks to [Erase](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erase). With no [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) in sight and multiple [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon)s in hand, Salvatto had the advantage. Even when Prosek cast [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos), it was Salvatto's [Hushwing Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hushwing+Gryff) that stymied Prosek's ability to self-mill, and a second [Erase](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erase) dispatched of the Whip.

The final game featured a sequence Prosek did not want to see: no land after revealing for a third-turn [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) while staring down [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) and [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) from Salvatto. [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) dispatched the enchantment-creature, ensuring Prosek's mana troubles would remain.


Salvatto's lead was so large, [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege) even came down naming Dragons instead of Khans. With a very real clock staring him down, and few ways to mitigate the inevitable, Prosek inevitably extended the hand.
