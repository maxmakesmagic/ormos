Care to try your hand at Day 1's format? Below you'll find a sealed pool with many powerful options. Will you favor aggression or control? Raw power or synergy? As you build, consider what your deck's plan is. How will the games play out? What threats can you expect to face, and how will you deal with them? Choose wisely, and compare your work with others in the forums.
