Sunday Coverage



Team Japan—comprised of Kenta Harane, Yuuya Watanabe, and Shota Yasooka—demonstrated why they were one of the favorites to win all weekend.


The team was among one of the heavy hitters with both team captain Watanabe and Nationals finalist Yasooka competing as Pro Tour Hall of Famers. However, National Champion Harane also had experience, boasting two Grand Prix Top 8s and a solid win rate at top tournaments as one of the country’s top competitors. Team Japan showed why they were favorites by dominating all weekend, staying at the top tables through multiple stages in both days to secure their Top 8 spot.


And at that point, they didn’t slow down. As Watanabe and Harane won clutch matches in the semifinals and finals against Italy and Poland respectively to keep their team alive, it was Yasooka who sealed the deal in both key matches. Yasooka—who was piloting Ramunap Red—navigated perfect games against competitors piloting control decks he was typically accustomed to playing, showcasing not only why Japan was considered a tournament giant, but why Yasooka is one of the Pro Tour Hall of Fame’s esteemed players.


After many shaky years at the World *Magic* Cup stage, Japan has risen to the top, and shown the world why they are among one of the most respected regions for professional *Magic*.
