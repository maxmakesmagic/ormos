The Duelist premiered in January of 1994, six short months after **Magic: The Gathering** made its big splash at GenCon. Five years and 33 issues later, they took a multifaceted look at the history of the most popular game in the world.


A little over ten years after that, we take a look back at their retrospective in honor of Origin Stories Week. These articles, some republished here for the first time, follow the early life of **Magic**â€”from a hurried pitch by an excited grad student to the development of the Pro Tour and more.


For more about **Magic**'s early days, see [Mark Rosewater's article](/en/articles/archive/once-upon-time-2009-06-01) about his first encounters with the game.
