This week's "Sketches" looks at a powerful blue morph creature from *Onslaught*, [Quicksilver Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Dragon) by Ron Spencer.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Location: Breaker Bay, above the water. Action: Drake with mirrored or shiny reflective scales flying above the water."

Note that the card was described as a Drake, not as a Dragon. In fact, the card was originally called Mirrored Drake.

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Ron. Because he was told to paint a Drake, Ron didn't give the creature any front arms.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. R&D decided late in the process that the creature was powerful and cool enough to warrant being changed into a Dragon. That meant arms needed to be added to the artwork to synch it up with the other Dragons in **Magic**.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as it appears in the set.
