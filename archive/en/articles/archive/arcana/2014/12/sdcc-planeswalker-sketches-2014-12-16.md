*Magic* has [a lot going on at San Diego Comic-Con](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/san-diego-comic-con-2014-2014-07-11), which starts this week.



One of the coolest items available exclusively at SDCC is a *Magic 2015* Planeswalker Pack featuring Garruk's Axe by NERF, with all-new art for each of the six premium black-on-black core-set Planeswalkers by renown comic-book artist Jae Lee.

If you aren't familiar with Jae Lee's work, you really should be. He's worked on comics for Marvel, DC, and Image, including, most recently, the [Superman/Batman](http://www.dccomics.com/comics/batman-superman-2013/batmansuperman-1) series for DC Comics. He's also worked with such iconic characters as Namor, Captain America, Ozymandias (from Before Watchmen), and the Fantastic Four.


And now he's turned his artistic eye toward Ajani, Jace, Liliana, Chandra, Nissa, and Garruk. The art is so cool and unique that we had to share it with you. Click through the sketches below and you'll see the progression from Lee's earlier takes all the way up to the finished product.


And once you're done drooling over the jaw-dropping art on these, get yourself to SDCC to pick up the Planeswalker Pack with Garruk's Axe. Can't make it to SDCC? A limited number of both the axe and the cards will also be available online at [HasbroToyShop.com](http://www.hasbrotoyshop.com/) following the convention.


In the meantime, enjoy some seriously cool Jae Lee art (click on each image to see the progression).
