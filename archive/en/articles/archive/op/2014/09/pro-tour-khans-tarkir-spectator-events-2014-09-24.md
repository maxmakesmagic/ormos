The first Pro Tour of the [2014–2015 Premier Play season](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premier-calendar#/overview) is on the horizon. Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* takes place October 10–12 in beautiful Honolulu, Hawaii, and many of the game's top players are already delving into the finer points of Standard and Booster Draft featuring the new set.


What sorts of decks will the game's biggest pro players bring to the tables in Honolulu next weekend? What kinds of draft strategies will emerge? You can witness all the action, all the new decks, and all the pros under one roof at Honolulu yourself.

We'll be broadcasting all three days on [Twitch.TV/Magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic), but if you'd like to see everything for your own eyes, the Pro Tour hall is open to everyone to come and watch the action!


Spectator Hall Hours
====================


The tournament hall opens up to the public starting Friday, October 10, at 8 a.m., and will remain open until 8 p.m. that night. The tables for the Pro Tour main event are set up to allow you to view just about every game of *Magic* going on each round.


On Saturday, the hall again opens at 8 a.m. and closes at 8 p.m., but spectators will have even more to do! Local vendor Toylynx will be hosting scheduled and on-demand events all day Saturday for players to partake again. More details on these further below.


On Sunday, the feature match area will be blocked off, but we'll be busting out the projector and setting up the public part of the hall with plenty of seats, so you can watch the Top 8 of Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* unfold in its entirety. The tournament hall opens to spectators on Sunday at 8:30 a.m. and closes at 7 p.m., or when the Pro Tour concludes, whichever happens last.


Be sure to stop by, because nothing makes some of the weekend's biggest and best games more epic than watching them with a whole lot of people who also love *Magic*.

On Saturday, local vendor Toylynx will be hosting on-demand and scheduled events all day for spectators to participate in. Be sure to bring your Standard deck or some sleeves for the day's Limited action!


On-demand events will begin at 10 a.m. and scheduled events begin at 11 a.m., with new scheduled events firing on the hour, every, hour until the hall closes that night. You can download a schedule of events [here](http://media.wizards.com/2014/images/daily/ToyLynx_Public_Events.pdf).
