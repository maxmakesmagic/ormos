![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gputs02/985.jpg)Sideboard Japan mainstay Kouichirou Maki hopes to be taking the whole weekend off, but with his current Sealed Deck, he fears he'll be back in the reporter's chair come Sunday. He won't have it easy this round, facing Osamu Fujita, ex of Anchans. Fujita always has the same things about him: Jean jacket, a grimace, and a winning record.

Maki was forced to send back a one-lander, and Fujita's face twisted into a sinister smile. He had a pretty good start, considering. He led with [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) and a morphed creature, shutting down Fujita's [Goblin Taskmaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Taskmaster). He suicided his Taskmaster to make the [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) a little more reasonable, and started making mystery men of his own.

The two traded what turned out to be [Spined Basher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Basher) and [Battering Craghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battering+Craghorn). [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) dispatched the [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith), but Maki had a replacement. Fujita's Charging Skateback hit, but Maki had plenty of morphed creatures by this time, and Fujita was stymied by the [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith). His second swamp enabled [Anurid Murkdiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Murkdiver). Maki unmorphed his [Spitting Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Gourna) at end of turn, then made another morph guy. Fujita's 4/3's charged in. The Gourna fell to the Murkdiver, and [Commando Raid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commando+Raid) took out the [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith). 

Unfortunately for Fujita, he found out that the new morph creature was, in fact, [Venomspout Brackus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venomspout+Brackus), and it ate his Skateback when it attacked the following turn. That was the turning point, as Maki's 5/5 was far better than a pair of [Frightshroud Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightshroud+Courier)s.

Maki 1 - Fujita 0

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gputs02/986.jpg)Maki showed no mercy for Fujita's mulligan in the second game, opening with back-to-back [Elvish Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior)s. Fujita had [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) and [Frightshroud Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightshroud+Courier), but decided to eat damage for a while. [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) made things that much worse. Fujita decided to hold his mana open and pass it back.

Maki swung with his Warriors. He ended up trading one for the Courier, via the Husk. [Spitting Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Gourna) joined his team. Fujita answered with [Gluttonous Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Zombie). Maki swung for two, then dropped [Nosy Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nosy+Goblin) and offed the Husk. Fujita was in a bad way. Another [Gluttonous Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Zombie) helped a bit, tag-teaming the Gourna on the next attack, but Maki continued to [Threaten](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten) with [Symbiotic Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Beast).

Fujita flailed, hoping [Anurid Murkdiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Murkdiver) would be enough. Maki's one mountain and five forests still let him unmorph [Skirk Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando), giving the [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) enough firepower to take care of the Murkdiver. He bashed. Fujita tried a last stand with [Nosy Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nosy+Goblin) and [Frightshroud Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightshroud+Courier), but without a way to stop the [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith), he had no outs.

Kouichirou Maki defeats Osamu Fujita 2-0
