Sunday, 10:24 a.m. – Top Tables Round-Up
----------------------------------------


*by Brian David-Marshall* 

With Day Two of the Grand Prix rumbling to life this morning we decided to take a wander down by the top tables and see who was squaring off and get an idea of what [Legacy](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrtype15) decks emerged on top of the Day One heap.


Table one was playing on camera between Michael Patnode playing Goblins against Jesse Hatfield playing Zoo. Both players piloted their format staples in the face of the conventional wisdom that [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep) made their decks relics of a bygone era. Patnode advanced to a perfect 10-0 record in two games.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppro11/Table1.jpg)*Table One: Michael Patnode vs. Jesse Hatfield*
Table two was covered in detail by Nate Price and was a match between two teammates and Player of the Year contenders Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa with his BUG Landstill deck against the suddenly surging Owen Turtenwald Blue-White [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) with the ubiquitous [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic). This match also went only two games with Turtenwald showing why his teammates have started calling him X and "Oh-wen".


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppro11/Table2.jpg)*Table Two: Owen Turtenwald vs. Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa*
Table three was the last undefeated showdown with Wilson Hunter playing Painter Stone -- so-called for its [Painter's Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant) combo with [Grindstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grindstone) -- against MOCS competitor Reid Duke playing [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order) RUG. It took three games for Duke to emerge victorious.

If you ever wanted to cascade into [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) from [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) you need look no further than William Fisher's RUG deck that won in three games at table four. He was playing against Paul Ewenstein's Aggro Bant deck that took him to three games.

Table five saw a Bant mirror of sorts with David Houghton playing the same Aggro Bant deck as Ewenstein and he also lost in three games. His opponent was Scott Abromowski playing NO ([Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order)) Bant.

Feature Match Round 10 – Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa vs. Owen Turtenwald
---------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Nate Price* 

Knowing that both of these players were coming into the day undefeated, it seemed likely that they would meet at some point. Both of these players just simply seem to win. Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa has got seven Grand Prix Top 8s, two Worlds Top 8s, and four Pro Tour Top 8s to his name, finally breaking through with a win last year in San Juan. But that shouldn't leave you believe that Owen Turtenwald is a slouch. He is on quite the tear. He's already made Top 8 at two other Grand Prix this year, putting himself into the thick of the Player of the Year race. On top of that, he has gone undefeated on Day 1 of four of the last five Grand Prix he's played in.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppro11/fm10Tur.JPG)*Except when he's slouching.*
Unfortunately, his deck seemed determined to make an already difficult match even more difficult. He mulliganned to five on the draw. He did crack first, landing a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) on PV's third end step. P was holding gas. [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill), [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood), [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict), [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep), and a Pair of Jaces. After studying for a moment, Turtenwald put the [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) on the bottom. Before allowing Turtenwald to untap, PV aimed a [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) at him, once again clearing the board. With PV mostly tapped out, Turtenwald stuck a [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) on his next turn, fetching himself a [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull).


PV cast a [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) on his turn, the card he had cycled into off of the Clique. This returned the [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) in his graveyard to his hand. He immediately played it before trying to use [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) to kill Turtenwald's inactive Mystic. In response, Turtenwald activated his [Mishra's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory), but PV [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)ed it. A little counter war featuring a pair of [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep)s and a [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) ensued, and the Mystic stuck around. This allowed Turtenwald to get his [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) into play around Paulo's countermagic.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppro11/fm10Ros.jpg)PV tried to find some answers by playing [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), but he didn't find what he was looking for in the one turn he had before the [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) ate him. After a shuffle, he managed to find a [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) to deal with the Mystic, but the [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) was still beating him down. Eventually, he tried a second Jace, but it was stopped by a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), accidentally flashing a Jace of his own. With the clear advantage, Turtenwald tried to lock it up with a [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill), but PV had a [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare). Knowing that a Jace lie around the corner should Turtenwald find a fourth land, PV dredged back his [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam), which he used to [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) one of Turtenwald's [Tundra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tundra)s. After taking one more hit down to two, he was able to recur his [Mishra's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory) for an infinite blocker as well. It looked like he'd set up a great defense to buy himself a little time, but Turtenwald managed to find a [Mishra's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory). Unable to play both the [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) and [Mishra's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory) in the same turn, PV tried a last-ditch [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) to find some prayer. Instead, he found nothing.


"I can't help but feel I got lucky that game," Turtenwald said after a quick sigh of relief.


Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa 0 – Owen Turtenwald 1


Paulo made the decision to crack his [Flooded Strand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand) for a [Tropical Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tropical+Island) on the second turn. He had a [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) in his hand, but only one other land, so he had to act in order to keep playing the lands that are so important in this matchup. Turtenwald made sure that was his only time, though, shutting [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) off with [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage). He found a fourth land naturally on his next draw, allowing him to avoid cracking his new old [Flooded Strand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand). He made good use of the fetch land with a [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) to follow it. He found a [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland), which he promptly played and used on Turtenwald's lone [Tundra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tundra). In response, Turtenwald fired off a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppro11/fm10Tur2.jpg)[Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep), [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse), [Go for the Throat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat), [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), and [Tropical Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tropical+Island) were the contents of PV's hand. Turtenwald thought for a moment before taking the [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse). The Pulse turned into a [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), which was actually much better in the situation. PV fetched up a second [Underground Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea) and promptly put the powerful enchantment into play.


Again, Turtenwald denied him the chance to use his card. His [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) drew out a Mental Misstp, but he had a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) to force it through. Immediately after that, with a clear advantage and PV tapped out, he dropped the [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill). An attack dropped PV to nine. PV tried to clean up the mess, cracking the [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) with a [Go for the Throat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) and a [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), removing Turtenwald's attackers, but dropping himself to five in the process. Turtenwald kep swinging, using a [Mishra's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory) to do his dirty work. Now free to begin dredging [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam), Paulo did just that, trying to mill off a [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) to Loam back, which was his best way of stopping the Factory before it killed him. Unfortunately, two unsuccessful dredges left him with a large, useless graveyard, which Turtenwald put him into.


Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa 0 – Owen Turtenwald 2

Deck Tech - Hulk Rebirth with Jeremie Ross-Latour
-------------------------------------------------


*by Brian David-Marshall* 


![Pattern of Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pattern+of+Rebirth)

I got the chance to watch [Protean Hulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Protean%2BHulk)-[Pattern of Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Pattern%2Bof%2BRebirth)creator Felix Lapan play in the Feature Match area yesterday and could not help but root for a deck featuring some of my favorite cards from the era of Urza block -- [Pattern of Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pattern+of+Rebirth), [Academy Rector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Rector), and [Phyrexian Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Tower).


Lapan described himself yesterday as a casual player who has been working on this deck on the Montreal [Legacy](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrtype15) scene for the past year.


He debuted the deck many months ago and won a 29 person event with it right out of the gate. He has continued to tinker with the deck as new sets were released and [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) for [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) fit perfectly into the deck's game plan.


Felix won a Grand Prix Trial on Friday Night but could not capitalize on his three byes when he picked up three quick losses on Day One and dropped from the event. Fighting on in his stead was his friend Jeremie Ross-Latour who had only picked up two losses coming into Day Two and navigated round 10 successfully.



![Academy Rector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Academy+Rector)

For the second round of Day Two action he was squaring off against [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge)-wielding Justin Russell and was looking at a hand of [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order), [Pattern of Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pattern+of+Rebirth), [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith), and three lands.


"I am going to keep this one," announced Ross-Latour and I figured if we were going to see just how this deck works that was about as good a hand as you could ask for.


Russell led off with [City of Brass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) and announced: "[Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), targeting myself."


"Are you playing [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge)?"


"I might be. I am naming [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp)," said Russell who also showed off [Bridge from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) and [Cephalid Coliseum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum). He had mulliganed to five on the play.



![Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stinkweed+Imp)

Ross-Latour played [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) for zero and fetched [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) to accelerate his mana development. Russell put his opponent on a [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order) deck.


"There might be 10/10s in my future," he sighed as he dredged back [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) and netted a [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) for his efforts. "I wonder how awkward this is going to be for me."


"[Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) you naming [Sarpadian Empires, Vol. VII](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarpadian+Empires%2C+Vol.+VII)," laughed Roos-Latour, who needed to get the [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Cabal%2BTherapy) into his graveyard as a sac outlet. he saw the Imp, [Bridge from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below), and [Cephalid Coliseum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum).



![Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Natural+Order)

Russell was able to start dredging [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Golgari%2BGrave-Troll)s. He played and cracked the Coliseum and flashed back [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) naming [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order).


"Bingo!" said Ross Latour who also showed off the [Pattern of Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pattern+of+Rebirth) as his only other live card.


"Let me read this," frowned Russell as he parsed the Pattern and suddenly understood why Ross-Latour had thrown away his discard spell.


"Good thing you have that [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy)."


The Canadian played his fourth land -- this was just turn three mind you -- and put Pattern on the [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor).



![Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dryad+Arbor)

"If there are any other spicy cards you want to name, now is the time to do it," laughed Russell.


Ross-Latour surveyed the graveyard and saw multiple [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Careful%2BStudy) and [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough)s. He flashed back [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Cabal%2BTherapy) -- the [Pattern of Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Pattern%2Bof%2BRebirth) triggered immediately and he searched out [Protean Hulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk) -- and shrugged, naming [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough). He was out of mana though and needed to live a turn and be able to untap his [Phyrexian Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Tower) that he had needed to use in a more traditional mana to generate mana that turn.


Russell was able to mount a small attack but his deck was not firing on all cylinders -- and he had to exile a [Bridge from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) when his opponent sacrificed the Arbor. Ross Latour did not even wait to go to his main phase -- he did not want to draw one of his combo pieces. As soon as he untapped he sacrificed the Hulk with [Phyrexian Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Tower) and got [Carrion Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) and [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double). He sacrificed the [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double), which was copying the [Protean Hulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk), to [Carrion Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) and demonstrated an infinite loop by fetching [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) and [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic)


**Here is how it works:**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Reveillark
 | 
Body Double
 |
| 
Mogg Fanatic
 | 
Carrion Feeder
 |

The [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) comes into play with the [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) and the [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) is sacrificed to deal one damage to the opponent.


The [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) then gets sacrificed to the [Carrion Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) and [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) and [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) get returned to play.


The [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) copies the [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) and gets sacrificed to the [Carrion Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) and then returns itself -- now a 0/0 in the graveyard


-- to play along with the [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic). From there he can demonstrate that he can keep doing that over and over again for nigh infinite damage.


For the second game Russell led off with [Putrid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp) and Ross-Latour had a [Tinder Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinder+Wall). Russell had a slow start and could only watch helplessly as the Canadian played a pair of [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) on turn two. [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) on turn 3 meant Ross-Latour had access to 8 mana.


He used two to play [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) for 1 fetching [Starved Rusalka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starved+Rusalka).


"This is only there for [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) and it is the first time it has ever been good. So it is never leaving my deck," laughed Ross-Latour about the only green sacrifice outlet he could find for his deck.


"I play [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge). You don't have to tell me," laughed Russell.


Ross-Latour used four more mana to play [Pattern of Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pattern+of+Rebirth) on one of his Birds that he tapped for mana. He had two green mana floating and he was able to Rusalka the Bird into [Protean Hulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk) and then the Hulk into infinite combo death.

Feature Match Round 14 – Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa vs. Drew Levin
----------------------------------------------------------------


*by Nate Price* 

Nate Price


Both of these players have been jockeying for position down the stretch, looking to lock things up so they can draw into Top 8. Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa and his BUG Landstill deck have been making a mockery of this field this field so far, deftly maneuvering amidst the decks and picking up win after win. Drew Levin was a player we had been keeping an eye on all weekend, waiting for him and his UW deck to make a break for Top 8. It appeared that this was the home stretch of that break.


### Game 1


Levin hit first, suspending an [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) on the third turn. PV had to dig for lands with a [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) to cast his [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). After a brief counter war, Levin cast Fact or fiction, still in response to the Jace. Paulo put Jace and [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) in one pile, [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare), [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), and [Mishra's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory) in the other. Levin took the smaller pile before letting Jace resolve. He used the Jace he had just received to kill the one in play before PV could use it more than once. The second copy that PV had in his hand came down to replace it immediately. After the Vision came out of suspension, both players sat with full hands.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppro11/fm14Ro.jpg)*Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa*
Levin tried for a [Crucible of Worlds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+Worlds), prompting a decent counter fight. Ultimately, PV won the war and the Crucible went to the graveyard. For turns the players played land and said go. Each turn, PV's advantage grew as he activated Jace. Eventually, PV drew a trio of counterspells out of Levin's hand with a trio of [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)s. Levin was eager to reduce the number of cards in his hand before his [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s resolved. When it came off on the next turn, PV simply let it resolve.


Things continued in this manner for a few more turns, with both players just drawing cards and keeping their hands full. When PV found his [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam), things changed. He cast it, returning a pair of [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s to his hand from his graveyard. He also began to attack with his Mishra's Factories. Levin tried to stop one with a [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares), but PV used [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) to kill his own Factory, enabling him to get it back with a Loam. Levin did manage to kill one with a Swords, leaving PV with one less avenue to victory. Running somewhat low on cards, PV started using Jace to fateseal himself, inching himself closer to an ultimate victory. He tried for pair of [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill)s to cement his advantage, but Levin countered them both.


With PV's Jace on 11 counters, Levin tried to kill it with a copy of his own. A massive counter war ensued, involving three spells from each player. Eventually, the Jaces collided, ending that path to victory. Just as before, PV simply played another.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppro11/fm14Le.jpg)*Drew Levin*
Both players were getting low on libraries now, with around a dozen cards left apiece. If the game kept up at its current pace, PV would win by a single card. Things got interesting a few turns later when PV fatesealed Levin and allowed him to keep an [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision). PV was running low on counter**Magic**, and it seemed at the time like the Vision was one of Levin's outs to win, aiming it at PV to take the lead. Levin kept PV off of Jace ultimate once again with a [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) at 9 loyalty. He suspended the Vision PV left him and passed the turn. PV replayed Jace and started his loyalty climbing again. Again, at 9 loyalty, Levin killed it with his own Jace. Again, PV replayed another. This time, Levin countered it, and PV didn't fight back.


On the following turn, the Vision came off suspend, and Levin aimed it at PV.


"I don't know why you gave me this," Levin commented. "It was my win condition."


"I have no idea either."


Levin still held two [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will)s, and they were good enough to force around a [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). The Vision resolved, and Levin felt confident in victory. Unfortunately, PV had a [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) and an [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) to trigger it, forcing Levin to draw three cards, putting PV ahead once again. A mere two draw steps later and Levin had been decked, with PV sitting at two cards left in his library.


Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa 1 – Drew Levin 0


### Game 2


The second game saw Levin get a good aggressive start for a time-crunched game, but his [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) was stopped by [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will). [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant) was next, and it hit the table, immediately making a Soldier. PV had a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) to make at end of turn, though, and it had dispatched Elspeth within two attacks. PV made a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) for himself, bouncing the token. When he tried to [Go for the Throat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) the second, Levin stopped it with [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). Jaces once again collided, clearing planeswalkers from the board.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppro11/fm14Decks.jpg)Turns flew by and seconds ticked away, but it became incredibly apparent that Levin wouldn't be able to win in time. The last turn drifted away, giving PV a ticket to Top 8.


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa 1 – Drew Levin 0**




Deck Techs – NO RUG with Reid Duke and Aggro Bant with Jon Barber
-----------------------------------------------------------------


*by Nate Price* 

This round, I was fortunate to have two of the decks I had been targeting for a deck tech playing each other, so I scheduled them for a feature match to kill two birds with one stone! The first was Reid Duke's NO RUG deck. For those of you unfamiliar with the nomenclature, NO stands for [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order), the powerful green sorcery. Since the printing of [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus), green-based decks have been adding the combo to their decks as a plan B, or a way to kill seemingly out of nowhere. According to Duke, the combo shores up holes, making his deck better against decks that he normally wouldn't beat.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppro11/dt2.jpg)*Reid Duke and Jon Barber*
**Duke:***Take this matchup, for example. His deck is just better than mine across the board. His creatures are just better and bigger, and my removal doesn't kill them as well as it does the smaller creature decks. [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order) gives me a way to win once his deck kicks in and starts taking the lead. One good thing about this deck, though, is that it doesn't need the combo to win. There were even some matchups I sided the combo out in.* 


At this point, I'd like to introduce you to Jon Barber's Bant deck. Bant has been a staple of [Legacy](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrtype15) for a very long time, reaching top tier status soon after the release of [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). The powerful creature gave the deck a second creature to go out of control alongside [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). With the inclusion of [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic), the deck gets another good way to fight counter**Magic**, as well as a way to get the equipment it needs to fight the creature decks. The deck has delineated into three varieties. One, the most aggressive version, is the one Barber is playing. It features all of the best creatures and very little counter**Magic**. The midrange deck features more blue to support [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will). The last version features the same [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order) as Duke's deck. When I asked Barber about the decision to run his version instead of NO Bant, he explained.


**Barber:***Honestly, the combo doesn't really help us win any match ups that we shouldn't win. With that in mind, we just wanted the deck to be as streamlined as possible. As it is, there are no dead draws in the deck. It's possible for both [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order) and [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) to be dead draws in those decks. We like that we can start to apply pressure and literally not stop thanks to [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith).*


Considering how prevalent [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) is this weekend, I asked both players about the card. It is in both of their decks and made things possible in their games that wouldn't have been without it.


**Duke:** *It really makes the deck run. After all I get to use it on turn one to fetch [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor), making it a ramp spell. I can use it to fetch [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Since I'm not running white, [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) is actually better than any three drop I could run, which makes [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) the best three drop in my deck! Also important is the ability to fetch a creature that I can [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order) away.*


**Barber:** *Yeah, the card is just amazing. It is the best creature in my deck at every slot. It's a land. It shuffles back in, so they never stop coming. You can cast three of them in a game and rather than thinning your deck, you never run out of gas.*


One card that both players mentioned that I thought was worth bringing up was [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppro11/dt2Order2.jpg)**Duke:** *Well, I don't want to say that the deck would be unplayable without it, buuut...I kind of would be. It is a first-turn Zenith target. I can fetch it with a sac land. It's a free creature that I can search out of my deck in multiple ways to use for [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order). It can chump block if needed. It's just a very versatile card that gives this deck so many more options.*


**Barber:** *I completely agree. It's amazing how many times I've gotten to sacrifice a [Windswept Heath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath) to get one of these and block a [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant). On top of that, getting a free creature that can hold an equipment so I don't have to miss my curve is great.* 


In their match, each deck showed the power it's capable of.


The first game looked like it was going to be all Duke. Barber mulliganed to five to start things off. Duke build Duke built himself an army of three [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s over the first few turns. It looked like he was going to run over Barber until a pair of consecutive Knights of the Reliquary appeared to hold off Duke's army. Eventually one picked up a [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), giving it protection from all of Duke's creatures. Within two attacks, Barber had come back from a fairly terrible position to steal the first game. The game really seemed to come down to the turn after the first Knight was played. It was only a 3/3 at the time, and Duke dug for a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) with [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). He had the chance to [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) for one more card, but chose not to, instead opting to play the third [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). That Knight was the beginning of Barber's comeback.


Neither player could stick a creature for the early turns of the second game. [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch)s were killed, a [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) and [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) were countered... it was just pure attrition. Eventually, the game reached a spot where both players were attacking with 1/1s, a [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) for Duke and a [Sylvan Safekeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Safekeeper) for Barber. After a few attacks apiece, Duke found a Green sun's Zenith to snag a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Barber matched that with an [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), but Duke had an [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) to kill it, but not before it got a couple of charge counters that Barber used to give a [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) +4/+4. At that point, the Goyf started eating chump blockers. Fortunately for Barber, a Green's Sun Zenith got him a [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) before things got too out of hand.


...And then they got out of hand anyway. Duke drew his card for the turn and cast [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order), getting a [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) from his deck. With his last card, Barber tried to find something to help him with [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), but Duke denied him with [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast). [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) did its job and sent them to Game 3.


Game 3 was interesting. Duke was forced to [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) a [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) on the second turn removing a second copy. This left him open to the [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) that followed it. He had a [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast) in hand, but no red mana to cast it. After getting fatesealed once, he managed to [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) into a [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest), allowing him to kill the planeswalker. After that threat was dealt with, Barber upped the ante again, playing [Thrun, the Last Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll). Duke tried to get some defense going, but his [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) was hit with [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares), and he lost his red mana and a [Tropical Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tropical+Island) to [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s. Just when things seemed lost, he sacrificed his [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) to [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order) and got a [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus).

Deck Tech: Hive Five for Hive Mind with Bryan Eleyet
----------------------------------------------------


*by Brian David-Marshall* 

Bryan Eleyet came across the country to play his [Hive Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Mind) deck in the hopes of qualifying for Pro Tour Philadelphia with a Top 16 finish or better. His friend Kyle Jefferson originally found a version of the deck on an online forum and immediately began playing the deck in MTGO Legacy Daily events to crushing effect.


"We saw that Team America was getting better," said Eleyet of one of the most popular Legacy decks which features [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach). "So we added [Misdirection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misdirection)s to the list."


Kyle Jefferson, ironically ran afoul of one too many Team America builds on Saturday and was cheering his friend from along the rail. Eleyet had only two losses coming into round 13 -- both losses coming against Merfolk -- and he had a steep task ahead of him if he was going to avoid a third loss. His opponent for this round was none other than Player of the Year hopeful Martin Juza playing Blue-White Landstill.


In Game 1 Eleyet got a Ponder Misstepped and floundered on one land for the bulk of the game while Juza was able to set up with [Mishra's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory) and [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill). Eventually Eleyet conceded in the face of a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) when he did not want to give away too much intel on his deck.


In the second game a turn two [Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) drew a raised eyebrow from Juza who [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed in response but it ended up resolving. Despite having a couple of Standstills cracked by Eleyet and being at a eight cards to three advantage Juza did not have a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) for [Hive Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Mind). Martin shook his head as Eleyet played [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact).


"I am going to die on my upkeep right?" confirmed Juza as he shuffled up for the third game.


Eleyet got his Ponder Misstepped and his [Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith)[Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze)d on the first two turns but got a third turn Monolith to stick around. Juza played [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) and Eleyet had to use [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation) to keep it from blanking the eponymous card in his deck. He paid for the Pact and had to tap his Monolith to do so -- ironically that would end up being Juza's undoing.


Juza transposed the card text from [Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) and [Mana Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Vault) in his mind and was dead certain that the Monolith could onluy be untapped during its controller's upkeep. As such he saw no point in using the [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) he was holding on the tapped Monolith on his own turn and instead attacked with a pair of Factories.


He only had two many back to play [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) when Eleyet untapped his Monolith at the end of Juza's turn and then played [Hive Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Mind) on his turn. Eleyet really wanted to qualify for Philadelphia and there was a deep audible sigh as he played [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation) to counter the [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell).


Juza did not have the [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) and could only [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) -- which Eleyet readily paid. He then played [Pact of the Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+the+Titan) and showed him two more Pacts.


"I think I messed up," said Juza. "For some reason I thought that you could only untap that during your upkeep. I just thought that was how it worked."


He revealed the [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) he was holding and talked some about the matchup which they both felt was slightly in their own favor.


"Any aggro deck and the Landstill decks -- not so much this version -- are pretty good match ups," said Eleyet, acknowledging that Martin Juza's deck might just be a notch or two better than what you usually find in the Swiss rounds. "Pretty much anything that isn't Merfolk or Team America is a pretty good match up. Both of my losses are to Fish -- I also beat it twice though."

Feature Match Round 15 – Brian Eleyet (Hive Five) vs. Ross Merriam (Elves)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Brian David-Marshall* 

Both players were sitting down to a win and in situation with 12 wins and two losses. There were just a hair too many players with that records for everyone to intentionally draw into the Top 8. These two Pro Tour aspirants were on the wrong side of the tiebreakers to be able to do so.


Despite the pressure of the situation they were both friendly and talked easily before the match. Bryan Eleyet was spending his third straight round in the Feature Match arena and they joked that he was becoming fast friends with the coverage crew and the two compared Grand Prix experiences.


"Is this your first GP?" asked Eleyet, who had come all the way from Spokane, Washington for this event.


"Nah," said the Connecticut native. "I think this is my sixth."


"This your best finish?"


"Definitely!" laughed Merriam. "I usually do very well in the PTQ on Sunday though."

### Game 1


Both players kept and Merriam cracked a fetch to play [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) while Eleyet just passed the turn with [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) in play. Merriam played [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) and also played [Wirewood Symbiote](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Symbiote). Eleyet [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed at the end of his turn and played a [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) on turn two.


[Quirion Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quirion+Ranger) and [Wirewood Symbiote](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Symbiote) allowed Merriam to do all sorts of mana shenanigans with untapping creatures and bouncing [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s. His [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) for two yielded [Elvish Visionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary).


"There is so much to be said for play testing," clucked Eleyet who clearly did not have a wealth of experience playing against Elves.


"So many of my opponents have said that today," laughed Merriam who had gotten at least one win yesterday to an opponent not using [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) on the correct piece of the Elves engine. He bounced Visionary with Symbiote and replayed it but Eleyet played [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) on the Visionary. Merriam discarded [Elvish Spirit Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Spirit+Guide) to play [Nettle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel) and passed. Eleyet played [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) for three [Hive Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Mind)s.


The Washington natiove floated mana from [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) into [Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), played another [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), and cast [Hive Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Mind). [Pact of the Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+the+Titan) was not something Merriam was prepared to pay for when his copy went on the stack and he reached for his sideboard.


"You got it."

### Game 2


Merriam led off with [Nettle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel) and Eleyet resisted any urge he might have felt to counter it with [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep). Instead he [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed on his turn kept the three cards on top -- drawing [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) with a Grim Monolity in the wings. Merriam attacked with his Seninel and untapped with Visionary.


Eleyet [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed on his turn and tapped [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) for [Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) but could not win this turn. Merriam attempted [Glimpse of Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+of+Nature) and that was a spell worthy of Eleyet's [Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misstep). [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid) still managed to look scary as he paid three green mana for a Visionary that he was able to pick up and replay with a [Wirewood Symbiote](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Symbiote). He was digging for a siodeboarded [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) but it did not float to the top in time.


Eleyet untapped into [Hive Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Mind) and played [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) -- something Merriam most certainly could pay for. Merriam went and got Spirit Guide with his copy but then the Spokane player played [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation) on the original [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact).


"I will copy [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation) targeting..." mused Merriam before accepting the inevitable. "...You win. I could not find a [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy)."


"When you cracked that fetch land I was saying 'Please don't get a [Bayou](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bayou)'"


Final result: **Bryan Eleyet wins 2-0 to secure a berth in the Top 8 of Grand Providence and earned the invitation to Pro Tour Philadelphia that he had flown across the country in search of.**
