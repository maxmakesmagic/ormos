The massive 2012 Grand Prix schedule concludes with trips to ten different countries from September to December, including a rare visit to Moscow and the first Grand Prix in Costa Rica. That brings the total Grand Prix to be run in 2012 to an astounding 42 events across the globe.


To help kick off "Hook" block this fall, the Pro Tour returns to the birthplace of **Magic** for the first time since 2004. Seattle's Pro Tour will be held October 19-21, 2012 and the format will be Modern / Booster Draft with a Modern Top 8. The Standard-format Pro Tour Qualifier season for Seattle begins in April with in-person and **Magic Online** events.


Moving over to the Grand Prix schedule, this section of the year features five events in the United States, four in Europe, and visits to Canada, Taiwan, Japan, New Zealand, and the aforementioned Costa Rica. A full schedule can be seen below. Formats will be announced in the coming months, so be sure to keep an eye on the Grand Prix information page. The top four finishers at Grand Prix in this stretch of the schedule will earn invitations and airfare to the first Pro Tour of 2013. The prize payout for all of these events except Bochum will be $30,000. Bochum will offer cash-equivalent prizes equaling $30,000 (prizes subject to change).


Start your Grand Prix prep by finding a Grand Prix Trial at a Wizards Play Network location near you. Look for Trials for the autumn Grand Prix to start soon and get a leg up on your competition with a three-round bye.
