### Shuhei Nakamura vs. Matteo Orsini-Jones


Shuhei Nakamura, reigning Player of the Year, comes into this round at a respectable 8-2, but needs to keep the dream alive by smashing through powerful Limited player and Englishman Matteo Orsini-Jones. Nakamura has a five-color concoction with a fair number of domain cards, whereas Orsini-Jones has a very aggressive black-red deck. 


The two players were extremely calm and collected as they prepared to do battle, shuffling up in complete silence. 


**Game 1**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptkyo09/r10_orsini-jones.jpg)*England's Matteo Orsini-Jones weighs the options.*Nakamura kept, and led with three mountains, not a good sign for his multicolor deck, while Orsini-Jones spent his early turns fixing his mana with a [Grixis Panorama](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grixis+Panorama). Orsini-Jones’s [Hissing Iguanar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hissing+Iguanar) was the first creature to hit play, and all Nakamura could do was pass without a land. The Iguanar bashed in to the red zone, bringing Nakamura to 17 and then 14 as Nakamura was forced to discard his [Nacatl Outlander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nacatl+Outlander), and then [Vein Drinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vein+Drinker), as the land refused to arrive.


[Scourge Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+Devil) accelerated the clock to strike 10, and Nakamura, unable to cast his spells, could only scoop on the next turn when no fourth land or second color was forthcoming.

**Game 2**


Nakamura led with a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) this time, and the [Jund Panorama](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jund+Panorama) that followed helped ensure he wouldn’t be encountering the same virtual lockdown due to mana screw again. [Matca Rioters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matca+Rioters) hit play for the Japanese pro as a 3/3 on turn three, but Orsini-Jones cycled into [Wretched Banquet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Banquet) to deal with the lone Rioters.


Nakamura, unfazed, tapped out again to play [Fleshformer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshformer), passing with no fourth land, but quickly remedied that with a second [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) into Bant Obelisk. He swung Orsini-Jones down to 18 since the Englishman was unwilling to block the incoming [Fleshformer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshformer) with his newly-made [Rockslide Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rockslide+Elemental). The first red Elemental was joined by a second, of the Hellspark variety, and both bashed in to take Nakamura to 16.


Nakamura untapped, laid a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to reach the full five colors for his -2/-2 on a stick, and followed it with the [Vein Drinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vein+Drinker) he had been forced to discard in the first game. The board did not look good for Orsini-Jones, but he kept his cool, swinging in with the now 2/2 first striking Elemental. Nakamura declined to block and went to 14, but did not hesitate to swing in again with the [Fleshformer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshformer), evening up the life totals at 14 apiece.


Orsini-Jones was up to seven lands but had only a [Rockslide Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rockslide+Elemental) to his name: not ideal for a beatdown deck. He swung in again past the active [Vein Drinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vein+Drinker), taking Nakamura down to 12. He followed up with a [Blister Beetle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blister+Beetle), shrinking the [Vein Drinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vein+Drinker) to 3/3 before attempting [Skeletonize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletonize). Nakamura held up a hand and responded with an activation that took the [Rockslide Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rockslide+Elemental) along with his dying Drinker.


Nakamura had a replacement monster, however, in [Charnelhoard Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charnelhoard+Wurm). Orsini-Jones looked at Nakamura’s hand of four cards, and made his move to match the Wurm with his own double-devouring [Tar Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tar+Fiend), a massive 8/8. When Orsini-Jones declined the block the incoming Wurm, Nakamura used a -4/-4 [Drag Down](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drag+Down) from his hand before the Wurm’s recursion damage trigger went on the stack, then replayed it to kill the 8/8.


Orsini-Jones combined [Infest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest) and [Bloodpyre Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodpyre+Elemental) to sweep the board of Wurms and Formers alike, but Nakamura quickly rebuilt his army with a [Rhox Charger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+Charger) and [Rakeclaw Gargantuan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakeclaw+Gargantuan). Orsini-Jones only had [Viscera Dragger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Dragger), and it alone couldn’t complete with the exalted, first-striking combination. He quickly dropped to 0.

**Game 3**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptkyo09/r10_nakamura.jpg)*Coverage reporter Keita Mori gets an action shot of Shuhei Nakamura.*Orsini-Jones got to start off the third and final game, but inauspiciously, as he was forced to mulligan. Orsini-Jones tried to improve his hand’s quality using two cyclers, and found himself a [Shambling Remains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Remains). It turned out his six appeared to be doing much better than Nakamura’s seven, as the Player of the Year again could not find land. He found a third land two turns later, but it turned out two turns of silence from the opposing mage is all Orsini-Jones’s team needed.


Matteo dropped a [Hissing Iguanar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hissing+Iguanar) and [Hellspark Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellspark+Elemental), his next attack dropping Shuhei from 16 to 6 and then 5 when the Elemental expired with a hiss. Shuhei could only pass the turn with four mana up. When Matteo unearthed his Hellspark for another go, Shuhei extended the hand.

 “I kept a one-land hand, with two cyclers,” explained Orsini-Jones, the silence of the match broken, as Nakamura just shook his head. “I didn’t want to go to five.” 


“It’s such a good feeling when your opponent is reigning Player of the Year and he goes, turn three discard,” Orsini-Jones added, clearly sympathetic with Nakamura’s mana-screw plight during the match but unwilling to look a gift horse in the mouth.


Orsini-Jones left the [Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena) triumphant, undefeated in Limited at this Pro Tour.
