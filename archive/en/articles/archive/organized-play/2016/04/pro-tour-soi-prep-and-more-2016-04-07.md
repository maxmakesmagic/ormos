*Shadows over Innistrad* will be unraveling from pallets and boxes and onto store shelves tomorrow, and that means the new cards will be introduced to the Standard Constructed format as of midnight on April 8. With it, the new Standard rotation kicks in. *Khans of Tarkir* and *Fate Reforged* leave Standard and *Shadows over Innistrad* comes in, reshaping the Standard format as we know it.


With a new Standard coming, now is the perfect time to dive in and explore what the format has to offer as everyone discovers what works best for them. The new Standard format has also given Pro Tour competitors a new deck-building puzzle to solve, and we'll be seeing what the world's very best players bring to the tables at [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi) April 22–24.


Today, we'll be taking our first look at the Pro Tour, along with what exclusive goodies will be available in Madrid's big tournament the weekend of April 22–24.


Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* Exclusives
============================================


If you're local to the Madrid region and would like to check out Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* for yourself, come on by! The Pro Tour is open to the public, and the tournament layout is set up in a way so that you can view every match in progress.


Sunday is even more exciting for on-site viewers, as we'll have seating and the projector set up to showcase the Top 8 broadcast, complete with the commentators out in front of the audience as they discuss the action.

Checking out the Pro Tour in person, or being a competitor at the event, also opens up an opportunity to pick up some exclusive merchandise that you will only be able to find at the Pro Tour! Perhaps the most sought-after item (and a Pro Tour merch staple) is the event-exclusive playmat. And of course, with this being a return to Innistrad, this Pro Tour playmat has gotten in on the double-face card design by showcasing two sides of Avacyn.

We'll also have some merchandise that will only be available for the duration of the *Shadows over Innistrad* block. That block-specific item, which you'll find at the upcoming Pro Tour as well as Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* in Sydney, is a sweet T-shirt featuring a fresh look at Liliana.

Also, as a callback to Zendikar, the merch booth will be selling this Pro Tour–exclusive poster, featuring original artwork from Kevin Tong.

Finally, this Pro Tour will also see some new evergreen additions to the store: a tin that will hold your draft sleeves and dice (along with some sweet sleeves featuring the promo artwork for [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy)) and a Planeswalker-symbol notebook for keeping track of notes, life totals, and more.

The merch booth will also feature staples from previous events, such as the [Trick Jarrett–approved](https://twitter.com/TrickMTG/status/700353351959982080) Planeswalker hat, the 2015–16 premier play season Pro Tour T-shirt, and the mana symbol baseball T-shirts.

Stop on by if you're in the area to pick up some Pro Tour souvenirs. If you're not in Madrid the weekend of April 22–24, now is probably a good time to start talking to your friends who are competing to see what they can pick up for you!
