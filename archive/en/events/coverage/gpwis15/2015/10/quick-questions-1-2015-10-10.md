**What commons do you most want to open?**


While it's the powerful and rare cards that get most of the headlines, the backbone of any good Limited deck is its commons. A few copies of a strong removal spell can completely blank an opponent's bomb, and they're much more important for a deck's overall consistently. So which commons were pros at Grand Prix Madison most hoping to open?

“The three I'm most interested in are [Clutch of Currents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+Currents), [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner) and [Kalastria Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Healer) if I can get multiples. I don't think blue is a great color in this format but those two cards are good. With Healer, in Sealed games go long and it's exactly the kind of card that can grind them out over the course of a game.”

“I have a few. Of course [Complete Disregard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Complete+Disregard) is the best black common. In green I like [Lifespring Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifespring+Druid) because it lets you do so much. And in red I really like [Valakut Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut+Invoker). The card is a good creature on its own, and when you hit eight mana it completely takes over.”

“[Gideon's Reproach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Reproach) is the best white common by far, and one of the best ones in the entire set.”

“I think [Clutch of Currents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+Currents) is great. It's better in Draft than Sealed, but I think it's really powerful in both.”
