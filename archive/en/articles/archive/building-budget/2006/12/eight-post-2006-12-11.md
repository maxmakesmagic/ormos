 - This week's deck is wicked-bad good. Totally, fer sure.

Howdy everyone, and welcome to the last new Building on a Budget article of this year! When I first took over this column from the ever-not-as-bald-as-me JMS in April of this year, I had no idea what to expect. From the highs to the lows, we had quite a rollercoaster ride, didn't we?


When *Time Spiral* was first released, there was a card that I immediately wanted to play with. This card is not the most flashy of cards, or the most desirable (good for the budget!), but it works well with a card from **Magic's** past. That card?




![Vesuva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vesuva)


[Vesuva](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva).


Its partner?




![Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cloudpost)


[Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost).


Back in the day, the French developed a [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) deck revolving around [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s. They would use [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) plus [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) to get multiple [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s into play, and use them to fuel an entwined [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail). They named this deck Twelve-Post, although they could only actually have 4 [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) out at a time.


Enough of the history lesson! [Vesuva](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva) allows you to copy any land, and that includes [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost). This means that if you play with four [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s and four [Vesuva](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva)s, you have access to a potential *eight* [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)! What does this mean for your mana?


One [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) = 1 Mana  

Two [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) = 4 Mana  

Three [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) = 9 Mana  

Four [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) = 16 Mana  

Five [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) = 25 Mana  

Six [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) = 36 Mana  

Seven [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) = 49 Mana  

Eight [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) = 64 Mana  

Nine [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) = Either you're playing the mirror match, or you're a dirty cheater!


Compare this to the Urzatron, and you'll see that a focus on the locus comes out way ahead! If you're playing [Urza's Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Mine), [Urza's Power Plant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Power+Plant), and [Urza's Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Tower), you need to get three different lands out at once, and then they produce seven mana. You only need one [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) to get things going, since any combination of [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s and [Vesuva](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva)s past the first will act identically to one another. Three [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s equals nine mana - outpacing Urza lands by two mana.


Now, let's say you build a deck around [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) and [Vesuva](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva). What do you do with such an engine? Let's take this step by step.


### Step One: Searching for Land


In order to make sure you get [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s and [Vesuva](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva), you need ways to search for these lands. Technically Eight-Post could start as any color deck, as [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) produces colorless mana. Green has the best cards to search for non-basic lands, and the original duo of [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) and [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) seem fine for use as ways to search for [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost). 


### Step Two: Searching for Land, Part Two


One old tried-and-true trick for setting up your draws is to run [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) in a deck that uses multiple shuffle effects. I've already got eight in the deck. [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) is a natural fit in this deck. Without [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), this deck can get stuck not having enough colored mana sources. With [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), the deck can play turn-one [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost), turn-two Forest, and then have access to two colored mana the rest of the game while dropping [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s/[Vesuva](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva)s every turn.


### Step Three: Finding a Use for 64 mana (a.k.a., Profit!)


You've got eight [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s in play. Now what? The skies are the limit, my friend! Use [Wurmcalling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcalling) to make 60/60 Wurms each turn! Cast and activate a turn-four [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver)! Wipe the board clean with [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), using only one land!


I took a look at the cost of these cards on ***Magic** Online* and found that they were all surprisingly cheap â€“ perfect for a budget deck. Let's look at a breakdown for the deck.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Card** | **Cost in tickets** |
| [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) | 4 for 1 |
| [Vesuva](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva) | 2 each |
| [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) | 4 for 1 |
| [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) | 4 for 3 |
| [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) | 2 each |
| [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) | 2 for 3 |
| [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) | 4 for 1 |
| [Wurmcalling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcalling) | 2 for 1 |

The total cost on four [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost), four [Vesuva](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva), four [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying), four [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), three [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), four [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), three [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), and two [Wurmcalling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcalling)? 25.5 tickets. This leaves us with 4.5 tickets to work with, and 32 more cards to fit into the deck.


Since we're running [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) and [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow), it's easy to fit in any other non-basic lands that might tickle our fancy â€“ they are easy to search out! As a kill condition, I added in the mother of all mana-intensive lands, [Dark Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) (30 mana? No problem â€“ that's only four [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s over two turns!)


I also decided that I could easily support a second color of mana. In particular, the ability to recur [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) appealed to me, so I put in the blue and added a single copy of [Academy Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins). Once I got up to thirteen mana (three [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s, an Island, an [Academy Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins), and any other two lands), I would be able to completely lock down the game with this artifact. I could activate [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), put it back on the top of my deck, and control every turn my opponent had for the rest of the game.


Once I had added [Academy Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins), I also wanted a B-plan for killing my opponent with a recurring artifact. I settled for [Triskelion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion). The Blue also enabled me to add in another spell which takes advantage of having a trazillion mana: [Spell Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Burst). Once I get multiple [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s into play, I can essentially counter a spell a turn for each Island I have in play.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Card** | **Cost in Tickets** |
| 13 Forests/3 Islands | Half a ticket |
| [Triskelion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion) | Half a ticket |
| [Spell Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Burst) and [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) | Half a ticket |
| [Dark Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) | 1 each |
| [Academy Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins) | 1 each |

With one [Triskelion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion), two [Spell Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Burst), four [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow), one [Dark Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths), one [Academy Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins) and the basic lands, I was up to 53 cards and 29 tickets. For the last ticket worth of cards, I went with three [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) (to stave off weenie rush) and four [Krosan Tusker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker) (another shuffling/land search mechanism), bringing the total cost of the deck to thirty tickets.


Here's the deck:

How did the deck do? Better than I could ever imagine in my wildest dreams. When I play in Extended [Pro Tour Qualifiers](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/ptq) in January, I'm going to use this deck as the starting point for qualification. Let's take a look at the game logs.


**Game 1: Brothwin (W/G Beatdown)**


He gets quick [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur), and I get [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost), [Vesuva](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva), then [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) for a third [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost).

**Game 2: Zeffrin (R/W/U Good Stuff)**


I drop [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost). He drops [Bloodstained Mire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire) and sacrifices it for [Sacred Foundry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry). I drop [Vesuva](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva), play Top, and set up another [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost).

I play and activate a fourth-turn [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver).


He plays [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) for 0 (thanks to my [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) turn!), and I [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) for [Academy Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins) on my turn.

He [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb)s it on my next turn, but I put it back on top of my deck, activate [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) to draw it, and replay/use it for the second time that turn. He concedes, since that allows me to lock him down for the rest of the game.

**Game 3: EMU345A (W/R/G Samurai/[Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis))**
He gets a lot of Samurai, but I set up my board with [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) and get one of his turns with [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver). This lets me empty out his hand to the board, setting up for a devastating [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone). I get several [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s to the board and drop [Dark Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths), allowing me to kill him in one swing with Marit Lage.

I don't have enough to recur the Slaver (which would allow me to make him sacrifice all of his permanents, one turn at a time), but I do make him lose half his board, including all his good cards. He also plays [Trespasser il-Vec](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trespasser+il-Vec), discarding all his cards.

I drop [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), but he drops Yosei number two. I am forced to activate my [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) in response so that I don't eat massive Godo death. He has a second Godo, which gets a second [Loxodon Warhammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer), and he swings me down to 8 before I can untap again. Once I do, though, I get [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), make him play another Godo (killing the one on the board), and lock the board down with [Academy Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins).

He [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)s and [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt)s me down to 1, but I get [Wurmcalling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcalling), drop a 9/9 Wurm, and swing in twice to knock him down to 2 before he draws a fifth land or another burn spell. [Triskelion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion) seals the deal.

**Game 20: Silverspear (B/R Rakdos)**


He gets an early morph and [Hellhole Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellhole+Rats). I ramp up to [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) twice, and then blow [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) revealing [Liege of the Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liege+of+the+Pit). Then I get a [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) lock, and he concedes after I am about to get his second [Liege of the Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liege+of+the+Pit) morphed.


*Record: 20-0*


**Game 21: ZaHand (B/G Zombies)**


He gets early [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch). I [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) it while he's tapped out, because I don't want to lose the ability to recur. He drops double [Rotlung Reanimator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotlung+Reanimator), but I keep them at bay with [Triskelion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion). He breaks that stalemate with [Undead Warchief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Warchief), but I block one Reanimator, shoot the other one with damage on the stack, and then recur [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) to wipe his board clean. A [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) for [Dark Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) allows me to kill him two turns later.

**Game 22: Aearon (Sunburst)**
He gets early [Draco](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco) and [Etched Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Oracle), and I can't draw any [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s. I [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) for four straight turns, and end up with eleven non-[Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) lands on the board! This allows me to [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) him, kill [Draco](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco) by refusing to pay the zero upkeep, use [Engineered Explosives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) to kill his own [Myr Retriever](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Retriever), and then use the [Myr Retriever](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Retriever) to get back [Etched Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Oracle) to draw myself three cards! Within a couple of turns, I finally get two more lands down and [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) lock him with [Academy Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins).

**Game 23: Rocktomaspm (B/U Dimir)**


He gets stuck on two lands, and I Reap/Sow both of them and start making ever-increasing Wurm tokens. He concedes after drawing no more lands.


*Record: 23-0*


**Game 24: GuitarHero (U/B Ninjas)**


He [Boomerang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boomerang)s my first land, then drops two [Mistblade Shinobi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistblade+Shinobi). He trades them for [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and then raw-dogs double [Ninja of the Deep Hours](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours). I make a 3/3 Wurm with buyback, he bounces it. I make a 2/2 Wurm, which leaves me enough mana to [Spell Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Burst) another bounce spell. He doesn't have one, and I draw four [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s, allowing me to start dropping 6/6 Wurms with double [Spell Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Burst) backup.


*Record: 24-0*


**Game 25: Quans (U/R Coinflip)**


He gets [Krark's Thumb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark%27s+Thumb) and [Fabricate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate)s for [Izzet Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Signet). I Reap/Sow his [Steam Vents](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) and build up to [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver). He has triple [Pulse of the Forge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Forge), double [Mirror Gallery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Gallery), and [Squee's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squee%27s+Revenge). I Squee him for 10 (he gets double tails on a heads flip the first time) and then drop a 10/10 Wurm (no buyback) on my turn. He can't kill it, and I have triple Island, quadruple [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost), a Forest, and [Spell Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Burst) in hand. He dies shortly thereafter to my Wurm.

Well, that concludes Building on a Budget for the year! I hope you all have a happy holiday season, a great New Year, and enjoy tinkering around with my Eight-Post deck! I didn't make any changes to the deck over twenty-five games (after all, why change any cards if you literally don't drop a game?), but there's a lot of things you can do if you have access to sixty-four mana!

*Puny Hew-mans! I am BoaB and I come with a warning for you all! This deck might cost thirty tickets now, but since that Bleiweiss made a deck that went undefeated, BoaB anticipates much rising of prices of cards in this deck. Trade for them now, Hew-mans! Trade for them while you still can!*
