Known Issues List Updates
=========================


In this edition of the Bug Blog, we've added a few Game Play issues for player awareness. Also, Wednesday, September 9 marked the introduction of public Leagues to *Magic Online*, so a current list of known issues that players may encounter while participating in Leagues has also been added to the Known Issues List.


The [Known Issues List](#list) has been updated to reflect these changes, so refer to that for the most up-to-date statuses on *Magic Online* known issues. If you want to see the history of fixed known issues, refer to the [archive](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-fixed-known-issues-archive).

**Newly Added Known Issues as of Thursday, September 10** 


**Game Play**


 


* Cardset | If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that had a choice made as it entered (such as [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) or [Painter's Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant)), the copy correctly allows the controller to make a new choice, but the abilities of the copy that refer to that choice do not function correctly.
* Cardset | Under rare circumstances, [Pyromancer's Goggles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Goggles) incorrectly creates multiple copies of a spell.
* Cardset | Players are unable to drag-and-drop cards to split them into piles when prompted to do so by a card like [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). Cards can no longer be dragged from one pile to another in these scenarios, but players can move cards to another pile by single-clicking on the card.
* Cardset | Under rare circumstances, a player who controls two creatures that can’t attack alone (such as [Bonded Construct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Construct)) but must attack with one of them will be able to attack with only that creature rather than being required to attack with both. Under even more rare circumstances, that creature will instead turn on its controller and attack that player on the next turn. We recommend that players keep their Bonded Constructs on tight leashes.
* Duel Scene | If a player’s spell or ability causes his or her own cards to be revealed, those cards are incorrectly not added to the player’s own Revealed Cards area. The player’s opponent should still see the revealed cards correctly.
* Duel Scene | Zooming in on a card exiled by a land with hideaway shows an additional basic Swamp. This is a visual-only bug, players cannot play the Swamp using hideaway. Right-clicking on the exiled land will display it correctly.

 


**Client**


 


* Trade | No error message is displayed when adding locked cards (such as cards used in a current league) to a trade binder. These cards are correctly not displayed to trade partners, however.
* Chat | Players who drop from a league cannot send messages using a league game’s chat window.
* League | When viewing a league game replay, the header does not display the league ID number. Instead, it displays the match number, incorrectly labeled as an event number.
* General | Under rare circumstances, the Upcoming Tournaments schedule does not appear on the Home screen and Scheduled Events don’t load in the Play Lobby. If this occurs, players will be unable to play in any Scheduled Event for which they are already signed up. Closing *Magic Online* and signing back in will address this issue. .
* General | Under rare circumstances, the Game Details window will display buttons to replay matches instead of a round timer or standings. This will also prevent a toast message from notifying the player that the next round has begun. As a temporary workaround, the Return to Game button found on that screen should address this issue.
* Help Scene | The Help Scene contains several minor display errors such as blank spaces and inappropriate line breaks.
* League | The player filter menu in the League Details window incorrectly displays the word “Clan” instead of the name of the player’s clan.
* League | The default sort order for standings in the League Details window is incorrect.
* League | A duplicate Duel Scene can be created by closing *Magic Online* and signing back in during a league match. This duplicate can be safely hidden by closing the window, but conceding in either window will concede the match.
* League | If a player sorts the standings in the League Details window, that sort is incorrectly not persistent once the League Details window is closed.
* Play Lobby | Paused Leagues are incorrectly not identified as such in the Play Lobby.
* League | The League Details window shows an incorrectly pluralized "View Your Previous Decks" button after completing a course in a Constructed league. This button will show only the deck most recently used in the league.
* League | When rejoining a Constructed league, the "View Your Previous Decks" button is temporarily incorrectly inactive between opening the Entry Requirements dialog box and the next time the League Details window is opened.
* League | If a player has more than sixteen decks of a Constructed league’s format, a second scroll bar will incorrectly appear when entering the league and selecting a deck.
* League | When a league transitions from Open (players can join, matches can be played) to Closed (players cannot join, matches can still be played), the message that informs players how much time remains until the league transitions to Completed (no more matches can be played) is not properly being sent. This information is still available in the League Details window, however.
* League | If a player attempts to play a match in a league before the standings load, the matchmaking dialog box will display "Stage 0" instead of the player’s actual stage number. This is a display issue only.
* Play Lobby | The "Play" button shown when filtering the Play Lobby to display leagues does nothing when clicked.
* Play Lobby | The text displayed in the search bar when filtering the Play lobby to display leagues reads “Search Constructed Tournaments Games / Players” instead of “Search Constructed League Games / Players”. Filtering for Limited leagues will show a similar error.

**Known Issues With Scheduled Fixes for the Wednesday, September 23 *Magic Online* Client Update** 


**Client**


* Chat | Viewing event details or joining tournaments causes chat windows that are docked in the Duel Scene to become undocked.

Temporary Workarounds for Known Issues
======================================


 


We're hard at work whittling down the Known Issues List. In the meantime, we've found temporary solutions that may help alleviate certain problems that players are experiencing. Refer to the table below to see if there is a suggested temporary workaround for an issue that you are experiencing.


**Game Play**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| General | [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) counters are obscured by the equipped creature.
   | Players can use card zoom or the preview pane to determine the number of counters.
   |
| Duel Scene | Cards that search for multiple cards at once don’t show the cards properly in the Revealed Cards area. | The cards are properly identified in the game log.
   |
| Duel Scene | It is visually difficult to tell which set of blockers an attacking player is ordering when ordering multiple sets of multiple blocking creatures. | You must start by ordering blockers for the left most attacking creature, then hit OK to move on to the next attacking creature to the right.
   |
| Duel Scene | Graveyard order appears incorrectly in expanded or undocked views.
   | Keeping the graveyard in small, undocked “preview” (default) window will display order correctly for cards like [Buried Alive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) and [Sphinx’s Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%E2%80%99s+Tutelage).
   |
| Duel Scene | Zooming in on a card exiled by a land with hideaway shows an additional basic Swamp. This is a visual-only bug, players cannot play the Swamp using hideaway. | Right-clicking on the exiled land will display it correctly. |

**Client**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| Collection | Dragging or adding a large number of cards to a deck or trade binder causes *Magic Online* to freeze while processing, resulting in a "Main Navigation is Not Responding" error.
   | While the client is not responsive, waiting several minutes will allow the process to complete. Using the error dialog to close the client will cancel the transaction. |
| Collection | Rapidly checking and unchecking filters for a deck or binder with a multi-type card (for example, [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) is an artifact and a creature) can cause a crash. | This crash will not occur if players use the filters at a normal speed. |
| Duel Scene | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out. | If a player suspects this is happening, logging out and back in may resolve the problem. |
| Duel Scene | Land can visually appear tapped at the start of a turn if a player turns a creature face up during their opponent's end step.
   | The issue is visual only and clicking the tapped lands will add mana to the mana pool correctly. |
| General | Under rare circumstances, the Upcoming Tournaments schedule does not appear on the Home screen and Scheduled Events don’t load in the Play Lobby. If this occurs, players will be unable to play in any Scheduled Event for which they are already signed up. | Closing *Magic Online* and signing back in will address this issue. |
| General | Under rare circumstances, the Game Details window will display buttons to replay matches instead of a round timer or standings. This will also prevent a toast message from notifying the player that the next round has begun. | As a temporary workaround, the Return to Game button found on that screen should address this issue. |
| Sideboard Issues:
  
 Duel Scene | Black game screen after sideboarding.  | These issues seem to be tied to the player's computer going to sleep during deckbuilding. Preventing the computer from hibernating may alleviate these issues.
   |
| Store | Updating billing and shipping information during the checkout process can have inconsistent results.
   | Players who update from the Account Settings page should not have issues.
   |
| Trade | If a player opens a booster pack that is in their active trade binder, attempting to trade a different booster pack from the same set cancels the trade.
   | Logging out and then back in will correct this issue.
  |

Known Issues List
=================



The following are a list of known issues on *Magic Online*. Our goal with the known issues list is to give players insight into what we're working on, as well as helping players avoid problematic bugs and performance issues.


Please note, this is not a comprehensive list of known issues, simply the ones that we feel players are most likely to encounter. These issues are also not sorted in any particular order, aside from their category. While the list below is not sorted by priority or projected fix date, bugs and performance issues listed as "scheduled" have a scheduled fix in the near future—this status is subject to change.

| Game Play Known Issues |
| Cardset | If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that had a choice made as it entered (such as [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) or [Painter's Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant)), the copy correctly allows the controller to make a new choice, but the abilities of the copy that refer to that choice do not function correctly. |
| Cardset | [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command)'s first mode doesn't appear in the Effect area after it resolves.  |

| Cardset | [Kurkesh, Onakke Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kurkesh%2C+Onakke+Ancient) does not copy activated abilities of artifacts that sacrifice as part of their activation cost. |
| Cardset | [Lightning Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm)'s activated ability will sometimes let the wrong player change the target. To mitigate this issue, we suggest letting the [Lightning Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm) activated ability resolve before activating it another time. |
| Cardset | [Oracle of Mul Daya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) reveals one too many cards from the top of the library after casting Genesis Wave or similar spells. |
| Cardset | A [Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) copying a creature incorrectly does not display its triggered ability in blue text. |
| Cardset | [Puppeteer Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppeteer+Clique)'s ability does not trigger when it enters the battlefield due to persist. |
| Cardset | Players are unable to drag-and-drop cards to split them into piles when prompted to do so by a card like [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction).

| Cardset | [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) incorrectly allows a player to redirect spells or abilities to the [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), even if it’s no longer on the battlefield.  |
| Cardset | [The Chain Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) does not allow Planeswalkers that enter the battlefield after activating [The Chain Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) to use their abilities twice. |
| Cardset | [The Great Aurora](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Great+Aurora) incorrectly allows tokens shuffled into a player's library to be drawn later in resolving the spell. |
| Cardset | [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) counters are obscured by the equipped creature.  |
| Cardset | Cards that ask a player to choose X targets, such as [Glimpse the Sun God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Sun+God), briefly indicate incorrectly that X is equal to zero when the last potential target is chosen before moving on to the cost payment step.  |
| Cardset | Casting [Sylvan Primordial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordial) causes the game to be locked in a multiplayer game if there are no legal targets for one player. |
| Cardset | Conceding while looking at cards with [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) reveals cards to opponent. This applies to all actions involving scry or looking at X cards. |
| Cardset | Delayed triggered ability of [Otherworldly Journey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otherworldly+Journey) has missing association arrows with the exiled card.  |
| Cardset | Demonic Pact does not identify the modes already used while on the battlefield.  |
| Cardset | If [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance) causes a player to sacrifice lands, that player won't be able to activate abilities of permanents for the rest of that phase.  |
| Cardset | In some scenarios, casting [Mulch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch) crashes *Magic Online*. |
| Cardset | Mana generated from [Crucible of the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+the+Spirit+Dragon) must be added to the pool before a player casts a Dragon spell.  |

| Cardset | Spells that target [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) more than once incorrectly trigger [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent)'s ability twice. |
| Cardset | The second ability of [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) does not display the chosen value of X.  |
| Cardset | Under rare circumstances, [Pyromancer's Goggles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Goggles) incorrectly creates multiple copies of a spell. |
| Cardset | Under rare circumstances, a player who controls two creatures that can’t attack alone (such as [Bonded Construct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Construct)) but must attack with one of them will be able to attack with only that creature rather than being required to attack with both. Under even more rare circumstances, that creature will instead turn on its controller and attack that player on the next turn. We recommend that players keep their Bonded Constructs on tight leashes. |
| Commander | [Mishra, Artificer Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%2C+Artificer+Prodigy) will freeze the client when used as a Commander. |
| Duel Scene | Cards that put multiple cards into the graveyard at once (e.g. [Buried Alive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) or [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage)), the cards appear in the wrong order. This is a display error only.  |
| Duel Scene | Cards that search for multiple cards at once don’t show the cards properly in the Revealed Cards area. These cards are properly identified in the game log. |
| Duel Scene | Colorless mana autoconsumed before special mana (e.g. from [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) and [Mishra's Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop)). |
| Duel Scene | Creatures that enter the battlefield with counters based on the number of creatures in the graveyard (for example, [Undergrowth Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undergrowth+Scavenger)) do not count themselves if they are put onto the battlefield directly from the graveyard. |
| Duel Scene | If a player’s spell or ability causes his or her own cards to be revealed, those cards are incorrectly not added to the player’s own Revealed Cards area. The player’s opponent should still see the revealed cards correctly. |
| Duel Scene | It is visually difficult to tell which set of blockers an attacking player is ordering when ordering multiple sets of multiple blocking creatures. |
| Duel Scene | Spells with multiple targets (such as [Silumgar's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Command), [Agony Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), etc.) sometimes lack visual indicators to show what is happening to each target.  |
| Duel Scene | The prompt text where the card states "Choose up to X target... X is currently [#]." States 'zero' when the last valid target is clicked.  |
| Duel Scene | Trying to attach equipment to creatures that do not meet the equipment's requirement incorrectly depletes mana pool. |
| Duel Scene | When affects like [Parallax Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallax+Wave) and [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) end and creatures return to the battlefield, if one of those creatures was a [Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest) then all other creatures are Exiled.  |
| Duel Scene | When colorless mana is added to a player's mana pool as a result of a creature dying in combat (e.g. [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion), [Su-chi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Su-chi)), the user is unable to spend that mana if no stop is set. |
| Duel Scene | When a player plays a Ravnica shock land (such as [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain)) off the top of the library with [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), the new top card of the library is incorrectly revealed before the player decides whether to pay 2 life. |
| Duel Scene | Zooming in on a card exiled by a land with hideaway shows an additional basic Swamp. This is a visual-only bug, players cannot play the Swamp using hideaway. Right-clicking on the exiled land will display it correctly. |
| General | When the "No Possible Play: Yield All" function is active, tapping [Mishra's Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) when it's the only land the player controls will automatically end the turn even if the mana could be spent.  |

| Client Known Issues |
| Trade | No error message is displayed when adding locked cards (such as cards used in a current league) to a trade binder. These cards are correctly not displayed to trade partners, however.  |
| Cardset | The promo version of [Mizzium Meddler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Meddler) made its way to *Magic Online* without a set symbol. The set symbol will be added with the launch of *Battle for Zendikar*. |
| Chat | Players who drop from a league cannot send messages using a league game’s chat window.  |
| Collection | Adding "All but 4" can have inconsistent results depending on the version of cards in the player's collection. 
  |
| Collection | Adding untradeable objects to trade binders doesn't always trigger the correct messaging. 
  |
| Collection | New decks with the same name as an existing deck cannot be saved. Deck names are not case-sensitive. Currently, attempting to create a deck with a name that differs only by case (e.g. “Mardu” and “mardu”) will not generate an error message.
  |
| Collection | Rapidly checking and unchecking filters for a deck or binder with a multi-type card (for example, [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) is an artifact and a creature) can cause a crash.  |
| Duel Scene | Black Game Screen After Sideboarding. 
  |
| Duel Scene | Challenging a player directly does not allow the player to set Wins Per Match or Match Clock options. 
  |
| Duel Scene | Land can visually appear tapped at the start of a turn if a player unmorphs a creature during their opponent's end step. The issue is visual only and clicking the tapped lands will add mana to the mana pool correctly. 
  |
| Duel Scene | When face down cards are given an activated ability, the art displays incorrectly on the stack when that ability is activated.
  |
| League | When viewing a league game replay, the header does not display the league ID number. Instead, it displays the match number, incorrectly labeled as an event number. |
| General | If a player is running *Magic Online* on a laptop connected to a second monitor, they are unable to maximize *Magic Online* on the second monitor.
  |
| General | Under rare circumstances, the Upcoming Tournaments schedule does not appear on the Home screen and Scheduled Events don’t load in the Play Lobby. If this occurs, players will be unable to play in any Scheduled Event for which they are already signed up. Closing *Magic Online* and signing back in will address this issue. |
| General | Under rare circumstances, the Game Details window will display buttons to replay matches instead of a round timer or standings. This will also prevent a toast message from notifying the player that the next round has begun. As a temporary workaround, the Return to Game button found on that screen should address this issue. |
| Help Scene | The Help Scene contains several minor display errors such as blank spaces and inappropriate line breaks. |
| League | The player filter menu in the League Details window incorrectly displays the word “Clan” instead of the name of the player’s clan. |
| League | The default sort order for standings in the League Details window is incorrect.  |
| League | A duplicate Duel Scene can be created by closing *Magic Online* and signing back in during a league match. This duplicate can be safely hidden by closing the window, but conceding in either window will concede the match.  |
| League | If a player sorts the standings in the League Details window, that sort is incorrectly not persistent once the League Details window is closed.  |
| Play Lobby | Paused Leagues are incorrectly not identified as such in the Play Lobby. |
| League | The League Details window shows an incorrectly pluralized "View Your Previous Decks" button after completing a course in a Constructed league. This button will show only the deck most recently used in the league. |
| League | When rejoining a Constructed league, the "View Your Previous Decks" button is temporarily incorrectly inactive between opening the Entry Requirements dialog box and the next time the League Details window is opened.  |
| League | If a player has more than sixteen decks of a Constructed league’s format, a second scroll bar will incorrectly appear when entering the league and selecting a deck. |
| League | When a league transitions from Open (players can join, matches can be played) to Closed (players cannot join, matches can still be played), the message that informs players how much time remains until the league transitions to Completed (no more matches can be played) is not properly being sent. This information is still available in the League Details window, however.  |
| League | If a player attempts to play a match in a league before the standings load, the matchmaking dialog box will display "Stage 0" instead of the player’s actual stage number. This is a display issue only. |
| Multiplayer | Dropping out of a game does not concede the game if the player is not the first one to drop out. 
  |
| Multiplayer | Multiplayer matches do not show up in a player's Game History. 
  |
| Play Lobby | The "Play" button shown when filtering the Play Lobby to display leagues does nothing when clicked. |
| Play Lobby | Clicking the Play button in an event lobby does not take the player to the next available tournament.
  |
| Play Lobby | The text displayed in the search bar when filtering the Play lobby to display leagues reads “Search Constructed Tournaments Games / Players” instead of “Search Constructed League Games / Players”. Filtering for Limited leagues will show a similar error. |
| Sideboard | Extra cards are sometimes added to a player's deck in addition to their choices when sideboarding. 
  |
| Trade | Attempting to add more copies of a card than are in a player's collection directly from the Search Tool can cause a crash. |
| Trade | Both players clicking Submit at the exact same time in a trade can cause the trade to be cancelled. 
  |
| Trade | If a player attempts to add cards to a binder so that the binder would have more than 50,000 cards, exactly enough cards will be added to reach 50,000 though an error message will display telling the player to decrease the number of cards and try again.
   |
| Trade | If a player opens a booster pack that is in their active trade binder, attempting to trade a different booster pack from the same set cancels the trade. Logging out and then back in will correct this issue.
  |
| Trade | Occasionally when using the Search Tool to filter a players collection, players will incorrectly receive list of cards that are unavailable when they are actually available. 
  |
| Trade | The Search Tool is not present in the Other Products tab of a trade.
