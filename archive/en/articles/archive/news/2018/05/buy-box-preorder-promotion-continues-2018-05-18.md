Getting a whole booster box already feels great—so many packs to crack!—but we're always looking for ways to make a good thing even better. That's what the Buy-a-Box promo program is all about. [With *Dominaria*, we tried a couple new things](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/dominaria-buy-box-pre-order-promotion-2018-03-21) and got a lot of great feedback from stores and players—enough that we're continuing two promotions in *Core Set 2019* and beyond!


Prerelease Pickup
=================


*Dominaria* was the first time you've ever been able to preorder your booster box and pick it up right there at your Prerelease, *before the set is even technically out*! That proved to be a popular option, so we're sticking with it. For *Core Set 2019*, *Guilds of Ravnica*, and beyond, you'll have the opportunity to preorder your booster box for Prerelease pickup at your local game store and get your hands on the new cards faster than ever.


(Supplies are limited—check with your local store for details. This promotion is only available at participating stores that are members of the Wizards Play Network, so make sure you ask!)


Special Promo-Only Cards
========================


Another *Dominaria* experiment we'll be continuing was the introduction of [Firesong and Sunspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firesong+and+Sunspeaker), a legendary Minotaur creature only available as a Buy-a-Box promo (not even showing up in booster packs). Going forward, we'll be continuing this promotion, offering a mechanically unique Buy-a-Box promo card at local game stores with each major set release for the foreseeable future. Grab your booster box from your favorite local game store to get your extra-special promo.


(As above, supplies are limited—check with your local store for details. This promotion is only available at participating stores that are members of the Wizards Play Network.)
