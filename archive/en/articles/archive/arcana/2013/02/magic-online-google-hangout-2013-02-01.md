Oh, hello! Would you like to know more about the **Magic Online** wide beta client? And would you like to learn these things by watching the recorded video of a Google+ Hangout that walks through the new features of the client and answers some common questions asked by the **Magic Online** community? Well, good news! Sean Gibbons is your host, and he's talking to Chris Kiritz and Ryan Spain. There's even a very brief cameo appearance by Worth Wollpert! That's what's happening!
