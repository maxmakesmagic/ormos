According to the events of the [*Invasion* novel](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=products/magicnovel/214380000), the dark lord Yawgmoth prepared for millenia to invade Dominaria, the world of his birth. 

If *you* were going to flood your home plane with a seemingly unending army of metallic horrors and sophisticated war machines, destroy every living thing you could find, and rip the plane down to its component elements only to rebuild it in your own image, how would you do it? 

Would you drive your minions to Dominaria in, say, a station wagon? No. You would not.

You'd order up thousands of these:

*Phyrexian portal ship, flight mode*


It's a Phyrexian portal ship, designed to make the journey from plane to invasion-worthy plane while maintaining the maneuverability of an airship.

Here's the portal ship in portal-opening mode.

These ships were key in Yawgmoth's plan to invade Dominaria. You can see them in the background of some *Invasion* card art, such as [Disrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupt) and [Distorting Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distorting+Wake).

[Disrupt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Disrupt)

[Distorting Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Distorting%2BWake)

You'll note that, in both images, the mission of the portal ships is being thwarted by heroes (Urza and Teferi in [Disrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupt), and the crew of the *Weatherlight* in [Distorting Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distorting+Wake)).

 Meddlers.
