While four- or five-color Green decks were all the rage in the first draft, they were joined in the second draft by the very traditional Black/Blue/Red. Black/Blue/Red has enjoyed popularity since the inception of Invasion Block, with a strong mix of creatures and some of the best elimination available in the game. Apocalypse adds a number of strong cards to the mix for Blue/Red-based cards.


The trend towards primarily allied colors continued in the second draft. Canadian's apparently, tend towards drafting from their first two packs, and use Apocalypse to shore up the edges of their allied colors. This use of Apocalypse is quite common, with the other two uses (drafting for Apocalypse by *starting* with enemy color cards, or drafting for more than three colors) being less popular combined than using allied strategies.


This draft also showed the first use of two color decks for the weekend, with two brave souls stepping into Blue/White and Black/Blue. The unpopularity of this strategy isn't surprising, since Apocalypse and Invasion/Planeshift both reward different two color combinations for their more powerful Gold spells. In order to stay within two colors, a player will usually have to eschew strong picks in other color combination.
