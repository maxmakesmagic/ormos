Live Coverage of 2004 Grand Prix Hong Kong
==========================================












Chuen Hwa Tan from Malaysia is the Grand Prix Hong Kong Champion!
-----------------------------------------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gphk04/fin.jpg)When a cadre of professional Magic players descended on Hong Kong the weekend after Kobe the joke making that rounds is that someone nobody had heard of would hoist the trophy. Chuen may not be known but he proved himself to be no joke. He was near the top of the standings all weekend long and defeated some stiff competition in the Top 8.


After dispatching Takuya Osawa form Japan in the round of eight he took down one of Japan's finest in the semi-finals as Masashi Oiso fell to his speedy black-white deck. In the finals it was a match-up between him and Pro Tour Amsterdam Top 8 player Olivier Ruel from France. Ruel put up more of a fight than was expected from his deck but in the end he would have to wait for his sixteenth Top 8 to win an individual event.


Chuen had only a Grand Prix Top 16 appearance previous to this and has never played on the Pro Tour. He is hoping to attend San Diego but was going to savor the experience of Hong Kong before worrying about another tournament.


From here many of the Pros will be heading to Grand Prix Sendai in Japan. The following weekend is Columbus and Birmingham. Come back here to keep up with all the happenings.
