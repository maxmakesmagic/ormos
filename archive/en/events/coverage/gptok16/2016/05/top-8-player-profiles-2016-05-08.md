Grixis Control, because it was the only deck which I could build with my own cards.

If I went back to two days ago, I would change a few cards from my sideboard. I would also consider playing Human decks, I just don't know which build.

I would remove [Evolutionary Leap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolutionary+Leap) from the maindeck, it was out of line.


**What is your favorite card from the plane of Innistrad?**  
[Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone), because it is almost as strong as [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) is.
