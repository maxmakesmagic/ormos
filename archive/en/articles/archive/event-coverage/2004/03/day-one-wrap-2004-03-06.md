It is time to put up the chairs and flick the lights. Day one of Grand Prix Hong Kong has come to a close. That sound you hear is the Pros exhaling a collective sigh of relief. Nearly all of the star power that was here today will have the chance to shine in the draft portion tomorrow. Despite almost universal cries of "my deck can't win" almost everyone squeaked out the wins they needed.


Masashi Oiso of Japan, last year's Rookie of the Year, showed no signs of the sophomore slump with an impressive 8-0 record on the day. Also undefeated were Chuen Hwa Tan from Malaysia and Steven Tan from Singapore. Victoriano Lim from the Philippines had a nearly unblemished record at 7-0-1 as well.


The top tables tomorrow will feature players from all over the globe clashing in the draft arena. The table to keep an eye though will be table number four. Lumped right in the middle of the pack with 6-2 records is a table that has all the makings of a Pro Tour Top 8. In fact only one player at the table does not have a Pro Tour Top 8 on his resume. Hon Ming Au Young is a Hong Kong local standout and he will be joining a who's who of Magic. Tsuysohi Ikeda, Jin Okamoto, Jens Thoren, Albertus Law, Ben Stark, Anton Jonsson, and Osamu Fujita will all try to stake a claim to winning one of the toughest draft pods in recent memory.


Tune in tomorrow for draft coverage, feature matches, player profiles and our special feature on when you should play the [Darksteel Pendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Pendant)!
