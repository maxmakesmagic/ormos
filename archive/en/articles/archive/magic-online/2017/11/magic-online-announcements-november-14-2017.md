**Play Point Bundles go on sale tomorrow, November 15​**


Starting November 15, *Magic Online*will offer three new Play Point Bundles in the *Magic Online*store. These Bundles are only available through the holidays, and will disappear from the store when *Rivals of Ixalan*releases on January 19, 2018.


You can use the Bundles either to round out your Play Point collection or to buy in bulk and save some money. Just purchase, open, and play. And speaking of saving money, if you don’t open the Silver (240) Play Point Bundle, you can use it to join an *Iconic Masters*draft between November 17 and December 6 to save 10 Play Points. See below for more on that.


More information about *Iconic Masters* and the Play Point Bundles can be found [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/iconic-masters-comes-magic-online).
