**Name:** Brandon Bozzi


**Job title and duties:** Creative Coordinator/Associate Developer. I manage the names and flavor text process, write names and flavor text, and work on design and development teams.


**Age:** 25


**Education:** I graduated from Richard Stockton College in 1999 with a BS in Psychology.


**Began working at Wizards:** 2000


**Previous job:** Before Wizards I worked at a Jester’s Playhouse, a great game store in New Jersey.


**How you got your job here:** Applied through the Wizards website. I had to move from New Jersey to California, then from California to Seattle, but so far it has been worth it.


**Previous jobs within WotC:** My first job with WotC was with Organized Play. I was the Northern California Regional Representative. I traveled all around Northern Cali, Oregon, and Nevada visiting retail stores that sold WotC product. I would teach them about the product, how to sell it, how to run tournaments and demos, and answer any other questions they had.


**Magic accomplishments prior to working here:** I've never been on the Pro Tour like some of the other R&D folks. But, I was enough of a Spike to win more than my fair share of local tournaments, including a Halloween tournament (I also won for best costume. That's right, I won best costume at a **Magic** tournament.) and an *Unglued* release tournament. (I won a rubber chicken stuffed with booster packs. Clearly a better prize then anything you could win playing on the *Pro Tour*.)


**Expansions or projects you've worked on:** I’ve worked in some capacity or another on every set from *Torment* to "Earth."


**Favorite part of your job:** Creating. I enjoy building the **Magic** world, both through card design, and through names and flavor text.


**Least favorite part of your job:** Paperwork. I use writers from all across North America to work on names and flavor text. Between contracts, tax forms, and other legal necessities, each set translates into piles of paperwork.


**Thing you've worked on that you're most proud of:** Though I can’t really talk about it, I’m very happy with the work I’ve done on the latest set. It won’t release for a year or so, but I’m really looking forward to seeing if you guys have as much fun with it as I am.


**Other games you currently enjoy playing:** I’m a gamer at heart, so I play pretty much everything. Here’s what I’m playing nowadays: **Dungeons & Dragons**, *Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne*, *SSX Tricky* (it just never gets old), *Half Life* (I know, I’m a little behind on this one), *Jungle Speed* (a super-fun new game I picked up at GenCon), and of course **Magic**.


**Favorite Magic card(s):** I love legends. I’ve been a big fan of the **Magic** storyline since the beginning, so legends have always seemed like the most flavorful cards to me. Before I started working at Wizards, I had collected one of every legend (with the exception of the [1996 World Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=1996+World+Champion)…Tom, if you’re looking to sell, give me a call ;)
