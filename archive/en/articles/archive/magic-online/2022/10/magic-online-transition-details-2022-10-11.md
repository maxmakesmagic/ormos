*Magic Online* will officially transfer from Wizards of the Coast's servers to Daybreak's servers starting at 9 a.m. Pacific time (16:00 UTC) next Tuesday, October 18.


Key Details for You
-------------------


* On that day, uninstall the old client, then after transition, download the client from the new MTGO.com website.
* Everything else inside the game will be the same.
* New help sites and forums are a click away once transition is complete.
* Follow [MTGO Twitter](http://twitter.com/magiconline) for updates on transition day.
* Redemption availability and pricing are changing with *Dominaria United*.
* [Commonly Asked Questions](#faq) are at the end of this article.

Moving Day
----------


An extended downtime is expected—allow eight to ten hours, barring any unforeseen issues. We will not rush as we want to ensure all our services (Store, Trade, Game Servers, Collections) work as you expect before we go live.


* IMPORTANT: All users will need to uninstall their current version of the game, then download the client from the new MTGO.com website once that site becomes available.
	+ The first time you start MTGO during or after downtime, you will see a pop-up reminder to uninstall first.
* All cards, decks, and other objects in your collection as of downtime will be copied to the new servers.
* All settings within the game (stops, keybindings, etc.) will revert to default values. You'll need to set them to your preferences once you are in the new game client.
* Casual games will be available for play once we are out of downtime.
	+ To test server stability, we will have a one-day Super Jump League available with free entry once we first go live.
* We will initially disallow trading and purchases in the Store for a period after we are up.
* Depending on when the work finishes, there may be a delay in getting Scheduled Events and Queues re-posted and Leagues un-paused. It is hoped that these events will be back on schedule by Wednesday morning at the *very* latest.
* Decklist data for events in the first week following transition will be delayed in reaching MTGO.com—this delay is needed to get the data pipeline running correctly.

Getting Help
------------


The most important thing to know is that, where possible, your customer experience within the game—how you join games, how you build decks, and how you compete in events—will not change.


That said, there will be a couple key differences in how you access help outside the game:


* The support website is changing—be sure to bookmark [our new support site](https://help.mtgo.com/) today. Once we are up from downtime, click there and input the same username and password you use for *Magic Online* to file a ticket.
	+ If you have filed a ticket with [Wizards Customer Service](https://mtgo-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new/) and it is not resolved by Tuesday's downtime, you will need to file a new ticket on Daybreak's site following downtime.
* Our main website remains MTGO.com—this link will become active partway through downtime.
* At launch, we will have forums available for bug-reporting purposes. You'll also log in to the forums with your MTGO username and password—just like the support site.

How can you contact us to provide feedback? Our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/magiconline) and the [r/mtgo Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTGO/) community are reviewed daily, and you can also provide general thoughts and reimbursement requests at [our new support site](https://help.mtgo.com/). For bug reports, the new MTGO forums are the best place to log issues where our team can see them, and you can upvote/like existing issues like our previous systems. We hope to have additional methods of contacting us available soon.


Redemption Timing and Changes
=============================


*Streets* *of New Capenna* will be the last set to be offered under the current pricing and limited-time redemption structures. Orders for that expansion's redemption sets close at 9:00 a.m. Pacific (16:00 UTC) tomorrow, as previously scheduled.


Starting with *Dominaria United*, redemption sets for Standard-legal expansions will be offered on a while-supplies-last basis. Once our limited stock runs out, no more sets of that expansion will be available to purchase—whether that takes a few months or a couple of years.


We are glad to be able to continue offering this unique service to our customers. Unfortunately, there are cost increases across the board—from getting the sets printed and shipped to our warehouse in San Diego to the general climb in shipping and energy costs. While we can absorb some of those increases, we do have to make significant changes.


The purchase price of a redemption token in the MTGO Store will rise to $35. Shipping fees will also go up—$10 for domestic orders and $35 for international orders. (All prices are in US Dollars.) Another key change: the shipping costs are now per item instead of per order.


The ordering process remains the same—you purchase the Token and its shipping cost (the payment processing will look slightly different as it will be handled through Daybreak's web-based system), we pull the cards from your MTGO account overnight the following Tuesday, then shipping takes place a few days later (longer during holiday periods). Purchasers remain responsible for all taxes and import duties/customs costs. Once we are up from downtime next Tuesday, full details can be viewed at our Redemption Policy page.


*Dominaria United* redemption sales are delayed due to the transition. Our current target date to open redemption sales is Tuesday, October 25, at 9:00 a.m. Pacific time (16:00 UTC). Please watch MTGO's [Twitter page](http://twitter.com/magiconline) or the Weekly Announcements Blog at the new MTGO.com for any date-change announcements.


That's it—we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!


Commonly Asked Questions
========================


Transition Logistics
--------------------


**Q**: Do I need to do anything with my account to prepare for the transition?


**A**: No action is required prior to October 18. To improve client performance, you can take the following recommended action:


* Clear out old non-League draft decks from the Freeform section of your Collection:
	+ You can shift-click to mass-select a group of decks within a format. Then right-click, choose Delete, and confirm deletion with "OK."

 


**Q**: What is the estimated time this will take?


**A**: We project a minimum of 8–10 hours to complete the transition. Once it is complete, to verify stability of the game, we will turn on some functions in waves:


* Wave 1 – Casual games (Open Play and Tournament Practice), and the Collection scene (including deck building) will be available to join right away.
	+ We will also activate a one-day Super Jump League to aid in stability testing.
* Wave 2 – Store purchases and trading will be disabled for a period after downtime ends.
* Wave 3 – Paid Events (Queues, Leagues, and Scheduled Events) will be restored last—aiming for Wednesday morning (October 19) at the latest.

Information on the status of each wave will be posted on the [@MagicOnline](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline) Twitter account.


 


**Q**: Do I need to install a new client?


**A**: Yes. Once downtime starts on October 18, uninstall the current Wizards version of the client. Then when the game is announced to be back up again, download the Daybreak version of the client from MTGO.com.


 


**Q**: Will anything be different about Daybreak's version of MTGO after I open it or are there changes to functionality?


**A**: There will be two main differences:


* The Terms and Conditions will be updated and carry an October 18, 2022, update date.
* Purchases in the Store will connect to Daybreak's web-based payment processing portal after clicking "Checkout."

Beyond that, MTGO will look exactly the same post-transition. All Leagues will still be active until their previously announced end dates. Queues and Scheduled Events will be re-posted just like any other downtime.


Your Account
------------


**Q**: Will I lose anything from my account in this process?


**A**: No. All items in your Collection at the start of the transition downtime will be copied from Wizards servers to Daybreak servers. All of those items will be available in your account once downtime is complete and you have the new version of the client installed.


 


**Q**: Will I retain my status, points, avatars, standing, etc.?


**A**: Yes. Play Points, Event Tickets, Leaderboard trophies in the current Leagues, Avatars, and all other objects in your Collection will be the same post-downtime as it was pre-downtime.


 


**Q**: Will I be able to access my account and buy things while the move is happening?


**A**: No. Accounts will be inaccessible as with any normal downtime. The Store and Account Creation will likewise be disabled during the transition period.


Getting Help
------------


**Q**: How do I get help post-transition?


**A**: Once the transition ends, you can click Daybreak's [MTGO support site](https://help.mtgo.com/). Links to the support site are also available within the help section inside the game.


The MTGO support site's landing page contains a knowledge base with answers to the most frequently asked questions.


![Support Home Page](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/bYfJ3l3cK0.jpg)


If you still need assistance at that point, you want to provide feedback, or you want to file for reimbursement:


* Click "Submit a request" at the top right of the landing page.
* Log in to the support site using the same username and password as MTGO.

![Sign-In Page](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/HGg9KdWcDI.jpg)


* Fill out the support form as completely as possible.

 


**Q**: How can I report a bug without requesting reimbursement?


**A**: Like past systems, *Magic Online* will have a forum available when we come up from transition downtime. That forum will be accessible at [forums.mtgo.com](https://forums.mtgo.com). If someone has already reported your issue, you can upvote it.


![Forums Home](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/TZeaHjGJJU.jpg)


 


**Q**: I had an unresolved ticket with Wizards customer service regarding *Magic Online*. Will that ticket be transferred to Daybreak customer service?


**A**: No. Any tickets not resolved by Wizards customer service by the time downtime starts on October 18 will be closed. Once Daybreak's [support site](https://help.mtgo.com/) is live when downtime ends, you can submit a ticket there.


 


**Q**: What happens when I change my MTGO password and then try to log in to the support site?


**A**: The password will automatically update for the support site.
