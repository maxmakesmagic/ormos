Be had to ship his opening hand, and Lanthier did the same. Their sixes were acceptable, and the match began.


Be started by fetching a mountain. Lanthier fetched island, and began sculpting his hand with [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), denying both cards. Be fetched again on turn two and played [Immolating Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immolating+Souleater). Lanthier played [Halimar Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths) and passed. Be hit with Souleater, pumping thrice with his mana, and then spending a further twelve life. Lanthier calmly showed him a backbreaking [Twisted Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Image).

*Dan Lanthier*

Lanthier untapped and laid [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) off a mountain. Be played his fourth land and summoned [Hero of Oxid Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Oxid+Ridge). The attack brought Lanthier down to twelve. Lanthier [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed and shuffled. Next came [Halimar Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths). He looked at the three cards with a frown, set them, and passed the turn back to Be. Be went to attack, and Lanthier sent the Hero home with an unkicked [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). He blocked with [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite). Be spent four life and a mana to get rid of it, then replayed his Hero.


Lanthier was in a pickle. He played [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa) for a mountain, then [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed. Be sent his squad and tapped out, trying for the kill. Lanthier played [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), untapped an island, and played [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) on the Souleater. He showed Be the [Splinter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin, and they were on to Game 2.


Lanthier 1 - Be 0


This game Be started off right, with [Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin) Guide. Unfortunately for him, Lanthier had [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep) at the ready. He played island and [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed, choosing to shuffle. Be got in for a quick four with a second Guide and [Teetering Peaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks). Lanthier put out a [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite).


Be swung in, and after Lanthier blocked, he cast [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). Lanthier tried to save with [Mutagenic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth), but Be had a second Bolt, killing the [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) and saving his Guide. Lanthier played out a [Shrine of Piercing Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Piercing+Vision). Be dropped another Peaks, and though the Guide gave Lanthier an [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa), he was already down to eight.

*Ronald Be*

Lanthier played his fourth land and passed. Be was stalled on three land, and hit again with the Guide. A kicked [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) sent it packing. Be replaced it with [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix). Lanthier [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm)ed it away and played a second Shrine, leaving an island untapped. Be threw down two Guides and charged in. Lanthier was down two four.


He dug with [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), shuffling everything away. Be moved to attack with his Guides, and Lanthier tapped one with [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch). Be tried to [Combust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust) it, but [Mutagenic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth) made the save, but left Lanthier at two. Be was happy to trade his Guide for the Exarch, and did so. Lanthier drew his next card, then conceded.


Lanthier 1 - Be 1


Lanthier kicked off with [Halimar Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths). Be fetched a mountain and got to stick his [Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin) Guide, knocking Lantheir to eighteen. Lanthier untapped and [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed, choosing not to shuffle. Be played [Teetering Peaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks) and hit again, giving Lanthier a free land. He fetched away a dud card from the [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), and was down to thirteen.


He untapped and [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm)ed. Be replaced the Guide with [Kargan Dragonlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kargan+Dragonlord) and levelled up once. Lanthier passed on four lands and took two from the incoming Dragonlord. At end of turn, he played [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), tapping a land and leaving Be with three mana free. He tapped four for [Splinter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin, and breathed a sigh of relief when Be tapped out for [Act of Aggression](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Aggression). He tapped his last mana for [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel), and he was on to the semifinals.
