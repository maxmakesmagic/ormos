In what seems to have become the theme of this format, a blue-white control deck faces off against Fires in the finals.


### Game 1


Kim was operating off a single land, but his mana draw did not suffer - over the first few turns he cast a Bird, a pair of Llanowar Elves, and a Barbarian, then followed it all up with Fires of Yavimaya. Although Hoon took a lot of early damage, he totally wrecked his opponent on turn four by destroying four creatures with Wrath of God. This on top of the Dismantling Blow he cast the turn before left the Korean player with nothing but a pair of lands in play.


As Kim struggled with mana, Hoon got plenty of time to set up total control over the game. He cast Story Circles for both red and green, and a Tsabo's Web. He now simply needed to draw a win condition. Eventually Millstone came into play. Kim tried several times, casting a Thunderscape Battlemage or attempting to overrun his opponent with Saproling tokens - but it was in vain. Hoon was able to mill his opponent at leisure.

| In | 3 Duress | 2 Urzas Rage | 1 Boil | 1 Obliterate | 2 Kavu Chameleon |

### Game 2


Mana problems plagued Kim in the second game. His two forests and a Llanowar Elf weren't enough to cast much. He was forced to make a Thornscape Battlemage without kicker, only to have both creatures removed via Wrath of God. When Kim finally drew a City of Brass and cast a Duress, it wasn't good news for the Korean player. He found plenty of countermagic, a Wrath of God and a Rout.


Eventually Kim managed to force a Blastoderm into play. Normally it can be devastating - especially if a control player does not have a Wrath of God in hand. Hoon was unfazed though - he used Gerrard's Wisdom to gain 12 life, negating most of the damage Blastoderm would deal in its lifetime. Kim used a Duress to take out his opponent's Rout and cast another Blastoderm. Hoon drew a Wrath of God and cast it. Kim tried to cast his third Blastoderm in a row, but it was countered. Kim forced through a Boil, but it only took out two Islands. Hoon still had six lands in play, which gave him an edge over Kim, who has taken eleven damage from his two Cities of Brass at this point. Kim had a pair of Rishadan Ports in play, which would allow him to at least force his opponent into taking damage from Adarkar Wastes, if not tap the Singaporean player out of blue mana.


When Hoon tapped out to cast Fact or Fiction, his opponent responded with an instant Ghitu Fire for seven, bringing Hoon down to three life. He would have won on the following turn by casting Urza's Rage, but Hoon gained sixteen life by casting Gerrard's Wisdom. He followed it up by casting Mahamoti Djinn, prompting the Korean player to concede the game.


**Sideboard:**


Kim brought his Saproling Bursts back in, for this game, hoping to surprise his opponent.


### Game 3

Kim opened the game with the not-so-common turn 1 Duress, turn 2 Yavimaya Barbarian play - amusing the on-looking Gary Wise. He got a Barbarian into play and was slowly eating away his opponent's life total. Fires of Yavimaya also entered play, but Hoon was able to counter or Disenchant all further threats for a while.


"Fat 'Moti" made an appearance a few turns later. Kim, apparently having forgotten how his own cards work, did not attack with Yavimaya Barbarian, which has protection from blue. He summoned a Thunderscape Battlemage with black kicker and passed the turn. Hoon, low on life, did not attack. On the next turn, Kim summoned a Kavu Chameleon and attacked with all of his creatures, allowing Hoon to kill off the Battlemage and go down to six life points. Hoon drew a Gerrard's Wisdom while holding three other cards in hand but chose not to cast it, keeping the mana open for a Foil. His opponent attacked with all of his creatures and finished the game with an Urza's Rage.


**Sideboard:**


Kim certainly outmaneuvered his opponent here. He boarded Saproling Bursts back out, while Hoon brought in Disenchants.


### Game 4


Kim was off to a very fast start. He summoned a couple of mana critters and played Fires of Yavimaya, then cast Shivan Wurm on his fourth turn. Hoon countered, then countered again as another Wurm tried to enter play a turn later. A Thunderscape Battlemage resolved, prompting the mana-hosed Hoon to discard a Mahamoti Djinn and Gerrard's Wisdom. Hoon was stuck on four mana - two islands and two Adarkar Wastes, so casting a Wrath of God or a Wisdom would be very painful.


Finally, Hoon had to use up his Wrath. Kim was waiting for just that, summoning a Kavu Chameleon next turn. The Chameleon went all the way, ending the game a few turns later.


### Game 5


Once again, Kim sneaked Fires of Yavimaya and a Barbarian past Hoon's countermagic. Hoon almost shut down a pair of Rishadan Ports with his Tsabo's Web, but Kim was able to destroy it via Thornscape Battlemage. Having reached six mana, Hoon cast Wrath of God, getting rid of the threats in play and still having the mana up for countermagic.


Kim's next creature was a Kavu Chameleon. Hoon cast his second and third Accumulated Knowledges, suddenly holding a hand full of cards. He proceeded to also Fact or Fiction, revealing Wrath of God, Gerrard's Wisdom, Mahamoti Djinn, Absorb, and plains. Hoon ended up keeping plains, Mahamoti and Wrath. Hoon proceeded to gain sixteen life with Gerrard's Wisdom he was holding, and it was smooth sailing from there. Mahamoti Djinn came out on the following turn, and Kim did not have the cards to race it with - especially not with the countermagic in his opponent's hand.


**Final Result:** Hoon 3 - Kim 2
