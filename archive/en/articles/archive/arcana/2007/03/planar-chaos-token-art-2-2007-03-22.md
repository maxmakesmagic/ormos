[Last week](/en/articles/archive/planar-chaos-token-art-1-2007-03-15) we showed three of the five unique pieces commissioned for *Planar Chaos* token art. Today we'll look at the remaining two, plus a "little" something to whet your appetite for later. 

### Soldier token

With the help of [Stormfront Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Riders) and/or [Benalish Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Commander), you'll have the Salt Plains swamped with these guys in no time.

### Knight token

What happens when your [Riftmarked Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftmarked+Knight) joins the party after some time in suspendsville? 

![Riftmarked Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Riftmarked+Knight)Say hello to his evil twin.

That's it for *Planar Chaos* token art, but don't worry, there's more to come in the future, where this guy's already waiting for you.
