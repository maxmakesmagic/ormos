The May 11, 2016 Update
=======================



 Posted in **Daily Magic Update**
 on May 11, 2016

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on May 11, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by Seth Manfield, [first on the Top 25](#top25), first in our hearts—[second on the Daily *Magic* Update](#winNY).


Today's Must
============


1. [Dreams Come True in New York \*4th\*](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32899_Dreams-Come-True-In-New-York-4th.html) | StarCityGames.com | Michael Majors

Michael Majors is having a moment. One of the Pro Tour's brightest up-and-coming stars, Majors has been on a tear lately that saw him reach Platinum status on the back of a string of major finishes. His latest was at [Grand Prix New York](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpny16), where he placed 4th. Which you probably already know because it was in the headline.


Not only is he killing it on the Pro Tour, he's also knocking it out of the park (to pile on more metaphors) in writing content. This article is no exception, as it covers Green-White Tokens inside and out in a straight-forward, readable way.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Winning in New York with White-Black Control](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13265&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=5-11-2016) | TCGPlayer | Seth Manfield

Why the 4th-place report in the Must slot and the winner's report in the second slot? Because Seth Manfield has to get second at something.


He doesn't get second at much these days. The leader of the Player of the Year race, winner of Grand Prix New York, and first as the humblest player dominating the Pro circuit, Manfield is pretty much doing it all.


1. [Limited Resources 336—*Shadows over Innistrad* Roundup](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-336-shadows-over-innistrad-roundup/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

Marshall and Luis are back this week to look at the current state of *Shadows over Innistrad* Limited, but the show is only 102 minutes long—so you can rest assured, they don't go through every single card. Just, like, half of them.


1. [Building Around Story with Alison Luhrs](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/building-around-story-alison-luhrs-106) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

Alison Luhrs, a community manager at Wizards of the Coast and a writer for *Magic Story*, joins Jimmy and Josh to talk about building Commander around some of her favorite *Magic* stories and characters. A definite must for anyone who tries to tell a story with their Commander deck.


1. [Fiora: Conspiracy Capital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS7WltCcoR0) | SeibenMTG

Seiben takes a break from Innistrad lore to visit Fiora from *Conspiracy*.


And now he's dead. That's what happens when you try to look too closely into Marchesa's territory.


1. [Blue-Black Mill Alternate Win Condition Modern Deck Tech for *Magic: The Gathering*!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNj1w6aaenw) | The Mana Source | Wedge

"Your deck isn't about interacting—at all."


Sold! Apparently this deck has done well on *Magic Online*. And it mills. I know that piques your interest.

1. [GP Toronto 2016—Event Vlog—What to do at a *Magic* Grand Prix?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu2Ga7ywPZU&feature=youtu.be) | Milo: The Gathering

I missed this a few days ago, but with Grand Prix coming up in the next few weekends, it's a good video to check out if you're thinking about attending [Grand Prix Los Angeles](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpla16), [GP Charlotte](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpcha16), or any other upcoming weekend festivals of *Magic*.

Top 25
======


1. Manfield widens his lead

It doesn't seem like that long ago that we were hailing Owen Turtenwald as an unstoppable force on his way to another Player of the Year title.


What we didn't count on was Seth Manfield [raising his game to ridiculous heights.](https://twitter.com/PascalMaynard/status/729838595188654080)


It still seems like a two-man race between No. 1 Manfield and No. 2 Turtenwald, but Manfield is clearly in the driver's seat after a Grand Prix win increased his total lead over Turtenwald from 3 points to nearly 9 in the Top 25 and [8 points in the Player of the Year race](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/top-players/statistics/2015-16-player-of-the-year) (The Top 25 is a one-year trailing calculation, while the Player of the Year only considers this Pro season, hence the slight discrepancy. They line up at the end of the season.). And I've been harping on this every week, but Manfield's lead in the Top 25 is so vast, he is the same number of points above No. 3 Steve Rubin as Rubin is above players *who aren't even ranked*.


While the top of the list had little movement, the middle was busy. After strong Grand Prix performances, No. 8 Luis Scott-Vargas, No. 10 Shota Yasooka, and No. 18 Yuuya Watanabe were the big gainers, while No. 15 Brad Nelson dropped five slots to fall out of the Top 10.


Additionally, Michael Majors and Kazuyuki Takimura joined the rankings this week, displacing Martin Dang and Kentaro Yamammoto. Majors is especially one to watch, as he's risen quickly and recently hit Platinum status for the season.

What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Magic Mics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics) | Reuben Bresler, Evan Erwin, and Erin Campbell

Last week the crew talked about teams and Super Leagues, so there's probably not much more to talk about this week. They'll probably just sit there and stare at their screens for a bit. Maybe play games on their phone.


Orrr—they'll talk about the hottest topics of the day. Whatever those may be. It's a live show. Anything could happen! Tune in tonight at 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT on [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics).


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Hélène Bergeot explains the attempted Platinum restructuring](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4itqyz/helene_bergeot_explains_the_attempted_platinum/)

We featured the video of [Hélène's interview with MagicTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmaPfNHV8IY) yesterday, but the discussion on Reddit has only picked up today. You can view the community response to her comments at the link above.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Sam Black's Black-Green Aurora Control](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpny16/9-32-decklists-2016-05-08)

When [The Great Aurora](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Great+Aurora) was initially released, there were a few attempts to create ramp decks around it that would out-permanent opponents and then set everything back with [The Great Aurora](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Great+Aurora). It was fun, a bit cute, and never particularly serious.


And then Sam Black turned his sights on it.


The deck builder extraordinaire finished 15th at Grand Prix New York with [The Great Aurora](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Great+Aurora) in his deck.


I shouldn't have to explain more to entice you, but I will. Black takes elements of [Seasons Past](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seasons+Past) decks (including [Dark Petition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Petition) and [Seasons Past](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seasons+Past)), mixes them with some ramp and some creatures (ranging from [Sylvan Advocate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) all the way up to [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger)), and a bunch of singletons held together by [Dark Petition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Petition).


I don't have his kind of genius, but this list is something special—and something I can barely explain. Just enjoy. Though if you want a more detailed explanation and have StarCityGames.com Premium, [Black covered the deck today](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32897_BG-Aurora-Control.html).
