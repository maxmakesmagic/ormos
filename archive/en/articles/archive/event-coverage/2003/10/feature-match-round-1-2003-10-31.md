![Round 1: Nitter vs. Jensen](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/992.jpg)What happens when you take *Mirrodin*'s heavy artifact theme and combine it with *Urza Block*'s explosive mana, [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) and [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder)? Pure insanity. As always, there's a heavy buzz around the first day of the Extended Pro Tour, as everyone wants to know who has done the best job breaking the format. In this feature match between recent Pro Tour Champion William Jensen and Pro Tour Nice Champion Eivind Nitter, we saw a perfect example of just how huge *Mirrodin*'s impact on the format is. Jensen's deck is based around the [Mana Severance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance)/[Goblin Charbelcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher) kill combo, supported by [Mystical Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor) and [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker). Nitter's deck also has [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), along with a splash of red for [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder), which can bring back [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) enough times to turn a regular game of **Magic** into Solitaire.

### Game 1

Nitter's deck came out swinging, as he played [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), and [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker). [Shivan Reef](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef) and [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder) followed, as Jensen used [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) on end step. He untapped, played [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) set to blue (imprinting [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike)), then played [Talisman of Progress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Progress) and a [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith). Nitter took his turn and used the [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) to produce six mana, played [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), and used it on Jensen. With the Welder active and able to keep bringing it back to steal plenty of turns, Jensen conceded.

Nitter 1 - Jensen 0

Nitter- "So, that was a turn three kill..."

### Game 2

![William Jensen smiles at a strong grip](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/994.jpg)This time, it was Jensen with the fast start, opening with [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) and [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key). Nitter summed [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder), and Jensen cast [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), looking for something to do with his mana. In the meantime, Nitter used the turn to play [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), and Jensen played [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), getting [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver). With adequate mana floating, he was able to activate it. On Nitter's turn, Jensen was in control and had a hand of [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), [Thirst of Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+of+Knowledge), [Great Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace), [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) and [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder) to work with. Jensen played out all of Nitter's permanents, causing the European to comment, "It's not looking back for me!" Before the turn was over, Jensen used Nitter's Welder to trade his [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) for the [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver). It was activated once again, and Jensen chose to discard [Thirst of Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+of+Knowledge) to the [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore). [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder) traded Jensen's [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) for [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), and [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) was cracked, drawing into [Citanul Flute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citanul+Flute). [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) shot down a Welder, leaving Nitter with one left.

Jensen- "You're done."

![Eivind Nitter can't help but sneer](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/995.jpg)On Nitter's next turn of being a spectator, Jensen let the [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) and Welder die. On end step, he cast [Mystical Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor) to get [Mana Severance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance), which took all the lands out of his deck. Luckily for Nitter, he now got to control his own turns. He cast [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) to get [Bosh, Iron Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosh%2C+Iron+Golem), and yet another [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) on the following turn to get [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus). [Rack and Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rack+and+Ruin) took out Jensen's [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) along with Nitter's artifact land. Just when Jensen seemed to be a turn away from losing to a Bosh attack and "chuck", he cast [Mystical Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor) to get [Rushing River](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rushing+River), bouncing Nitter's [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) and Bosh, which annihilated his board position. With only two lands and no threats out, Nitter had to essentially start from scratch, although he drew into [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) to help things along. Jensen used [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) to get [Goblin Charbelcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher), with was representing a lethal activation thanks to [Mana Severance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance). Nitter handled the problem by attacking with the [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) to bring Jensen to two life, where he couldn't use his [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) to activate the Charbelcher, and was short one mana to do it otherwise. Nitter's next attack brought Jensen to one, and he cast [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), looking for the one mana source he needed to activate the Charbelcher. It wasn't there, and he conceded.

Nitter 2 - Jensen 0
