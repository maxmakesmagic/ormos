Nine of the top 25 ranked players came to battle yesterday, only two remain. Ivan Floch had the best record with 8-1 and was hoping to start the day with a strong draft and be set for a smooth sailing to yet another top 8.



 When it comes to strategy in *Khans of Tarkir* draft the top players seem to be divided into two camps. One who thinks that the best strategy is to aim for four or five colors, drafting dual- and trilands very high, and then never having to pass a strong rare in any color. The other favors two color aggressive decks, filled with two-drops to put as much pressure on the board as possible and hopefully never having to worry about the more powerful late game cards or expensive morphs.



Ivan Floch, and Czechs and Slovaks he's been testing with, have been known to be part of the latter. And his first draft in Strasbourg was a fine display of this preference.
