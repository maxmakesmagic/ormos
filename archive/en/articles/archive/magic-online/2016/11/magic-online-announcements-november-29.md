**Upcoming Sealed MOCS Monthly Event on December 4**


A *Magic Online* Championship Series (MOCS) Sealed Monthly Event is coming up on Sunday, December 4! Players can spend 35 Qualifier Points (QPs) to enter the event. The series will contain 24 Monthly Events, each of which qualify top players for one of the four Playoff Events. These Playoff Events qualify top players for the *Magic Online* Championship, a Pro Tour, and the Pro Tour Challenge event at that Pro Tour.


Monthly and Playoff Events also award top players MOCS Leaderboard Points for the year as a whole. Top players on the Leaderboard at the end of the 2017 MOCS will qualify for the year-end Championship event.


We look forward to seeing you on December 4 for the latest Monthly Event! Learn more about the 2016 *Magic Online* Championship Series [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2016-magic-online-championship-series).

**The Year of Modern Flashbacks Continues with *Return to Ravnica* Starting Tomorrow**


It's 2016: The Year of Modern Flashbacks! If you want to build up a collection for Modern, these Flashback Drafts add everything you draft to your collection once the event is over. Even if Modern isn't your thing, you can enjoy a leisurely Draft through the planes of the past with rotating formats each week!


Triple *Return to Ravnica* Flashback Drafts start tomorrow and run until Wednesday, December 7 and are followed up by *Gatecrash* Drafts. Get the full schedule [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/content/magic-online-limited-events#YearOfModernFlashbacks) and mark your calendar for the formats you're most excited about!

**Upcoming *Amonkhet* Standard Pro Tour Qualifier on December 3**


Attention all Pro Tour hopefuls: a Pro Tour Qualifier (PTQ) is approaching! The second Standard Pro Tour Qualifier of the *Amonkhet* season will take place on this Saturday, December 3.


Remember, you are no longer required to enter into the PTQ Finals immediately following the Preliminary that you qualified through, thanks to the redesigned PTQ system that *Magic Online* Events Manager Lee Sharpe announced [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-qualifier-changes-2015-11-16).
