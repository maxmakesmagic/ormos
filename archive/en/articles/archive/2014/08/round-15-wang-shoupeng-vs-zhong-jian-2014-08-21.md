Both players have been enjoying a decent weekend thus far but would need just one more win to break into their very first Grand Prix Top 8. Wang Shoupeng has a handful of lifegain cards against Zhong Jian's Boros Burn and [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack) will prove to be a crucial card in this matchup.


**Game One**


Wang had a rather lackluster draw, managing only [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) on turn 4. Zhong capitalized on the slow start by pointing triple [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike)s to the dome, before chaining the demon to the rocks.


When [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) made an appearance, Zhong was able to negate the life gain with a timely [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack). However, the second copy successfully gained Wang 4 life, especially precious in this matchup. Zhong's [Temple of Triumph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Triumph) helped him find a second [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack), good enough to stop Wang's third [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) from cushioning his life total.


However, Zhong was facing assault from triple Gray Merchants and without a good way to remove those vanilla 2/4 bodies, he quickly scooped up his cards.

**Game Two**


Satyr Firedrinker and [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) quickly knocked off some of Wang's precious life points, but Wang was happy to half the damage output with [Devour Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+Flesh). [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) traded with [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) later on, restoring peace to the battlefield.


Zhong used the temporary stalemale to resolve [Blind Obedience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Obedience). After that, it was a simple matter of simply unloading the string of burn spells one by one.


[Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), in addition to an extort trigger, reduced Wang from 16 to 12 life. [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack) lowered that to 8. Double [Warleader's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warleader%27s+Helix) eventually made that a big fat zero, equalizing the score for Zhong.

**Wang Shoupeng 1 – Zhong Jian 1**



**Game Three**


Wang was first to play this game but was cursed with a mulligan. His next six were satisfactory, but not good enough to pressure Zhong and could only wait for his imminent death.


[Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) drew first blood, and [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood) on [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) was next. [Warleader's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warleader%27s+Helix) brought Wang to 11.


Wang tried to win the game fast with [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) and [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) but it was not to be. Triple [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack) and Lighning Strike was good enough to ensure Zhong a spot in the Top 8.


**Wang Shoupeng 1 – Zhong Jian 2**


Zhong Jian beats Wang Shoupeng, and advances to the Top 8!
