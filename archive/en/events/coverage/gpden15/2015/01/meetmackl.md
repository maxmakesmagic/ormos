Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






 Valentin Mackl Top 8ed his first Grand Prix last Summer before going on a tear over the remaining course of the year that included three Grand Prix Top 8s and eleven Grand Prix Top 16s. Austrian, Mackl often finds himself a stranger in a strange land when he travels to North America for Grand Prix tournaments. Despite huge amounts of success this last year, most *Magic* players still don't recognize Mackl. I had the opportunity to sit down with the 2014 Austrian World *Magic* Cup Captain to talk about his experience with *Magic*.
