Did you hear about the Inaugural **Magic: The Gathering** Game Dev Rumble? It was great! Teams from a variety of Seattle-area game dev houses came to Wizards of the Coast and played **Magic**!


First, the competitors:

That's a lot of competitors! Officially, everyone had an eight-person team, although there may have been deviations from that. For teams that were below eight people, there were extra competitors to add in. Everybody was split into twelve draft pods (Azorius, Izzet, Rakdos, Golgari, Selesnya, Orzhov, Dimir, Gruul, Boros, Simic, Pirate, and Ninja) and they participated in a three-round *Gatecrash* draft.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1163_gameplay2.jpg)Sadly, the play area wasn't big enough, so competitors had to roam around the lobby of the building.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1163_warpaint.jpg)Kevin Doo of Team Xbox Live came equipped with Garruk-themed war paint. He also went 3â€“0 on the night and was joined by eleven others:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Players Who Went 3-0 | Team |
| Kevin Doo | Xbox Live |
| Lucas Scotta | Xbox Live |
| Travis Webb | Xbox Live |
| Alex Loret de Mola | Bungie |
| Travis Pijut | Bungie |
| Greg Marques | Amazon.com |
| Aaron Forsythe | Wizards |
| Michael Mackend | Signal Studios |
| David Franti | Popcap |
| Jonathon Junker | Airtight Games |
| Stevn Stadnicki | Airtight Games |
| Sean Wissler | 5th Cell |

And after two rounds of play, his team was in the lead!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1163_scoreboard.jpg)In fact, the XBox Live team won! Here's how they did it:




| **Points Earned** |

| **Team** | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** | **TOTAL** |
| Xbox Live | 15 | 21 | 18 | 54 |

| Sucker Punch | 6 | 6 | 8 | 20 |
| 5th Cell\* | 6 | 3 | 3 | 12 |

Their prize was this handsome Garruk Trophy.
