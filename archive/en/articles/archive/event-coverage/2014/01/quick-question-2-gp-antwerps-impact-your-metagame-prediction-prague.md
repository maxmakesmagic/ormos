![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra14/qq_shenhar.jpg)***Shahar Shenhar**: Metagame predictions are weird anyway. I played against Merfolk, Mono-Red, and Red-White [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter%C2%A0Twin). I could use almost nothing of the detailed sideboarding guide Frank Karsten gave me!* 
















![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra14/qq_dickmann.jpg)***Patrick Dickmann**: I expected more of (my) [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter%C2%A0Twin) deck and more people to be prepared for the match-up. Unfortunately, true.* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gppra14/qq_juza.jpg)***Martin Jůza**: Not a big impact. I guess the blue-red decks, either the all-out combo versions of [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter%C2%A0Twin) or the ones like Antwerp's winning deck, are more popular now.*
