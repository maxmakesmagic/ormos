**JANUARY EPISODE**


The first of two January podcasts gets a head start on the *Planar Chaos* previews. Tune in next Saturday for more inside knowledge from R&D on *Planar Chaos*, with a preview card you won't want to miss!


Here's what's in store this week:


* With the [2006 World Championships](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/worlds06/welcome) in the books, Randy welcomes longtime R&D member Henry Stern to the booth. A regular at Worlds through the years as both a player and a Wizards of the Coast employee, Henry provides his unique perspective on the largest **Magic**event of the year and how Wizards has changed over the years.
* *Planar Chaos*previews are just around the corner! Before we get to the first card previews on Monday, writer Scott McGough stops by to discuss his [Planar Chaos novel](http://ww2.wizards.com/books/wizards/products/?doc=959157400). Are there any clues to cards and storyline to glean from the excerpt he reads? Listen in to find out.
* This Month in **Magic** is all about *Planar Chaos*. The [prerelease events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/prerelease/planarchaos) are January 20-21, and the[release tournaments](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/release/planarchaos) run Feb. 2-4 when the set goes on sale.
