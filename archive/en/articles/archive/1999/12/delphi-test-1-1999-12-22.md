---

**1. Ingo has a Gray Ogre (2/2), enchanted with his Spirit Link. Laurie has a Worship in play (and a creature), and has only a single life left. Ingo attacks with the Ogre, and Laurie doesn't block. Will Ingo gain life from the Spirit Link?**


Spirit Link (Enchant Creature): Whenever enchanted creature deals damage, you gain 1 life for each 1 damage dealt.  

Worship (Enchantment): Damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead if you control a creature.


a) No, since the damage was prevented, Spirit Link doesn't trigger.  

b) Yes, since Worship just puts Laurie at one life.  

c) No, since Laurie's life total did not change, Spirit Link could not trigger.


**2. Ingo plays an Engineered Plague naming "Elves". Laurie has an untapped Elvish Lyrist that is not summoning sick and a Llanowar Elves in play. Can she sacrifice the Lyrist to destroy the Engineered Plague, and so save the Llanowar Elves?**


Elvish Lyrist (Elf): {G},{Tap},Sacrifice ~this~: Destroy target enchantment.  

Engineered Plague (Enchantment): As ~this~ comes into play, choose a creature type. ; All creatures of the chosen type get -1/-1.


a) Yes, since the naming of the creature type is triggered, and therefore goes on the stack, so Laurie can respond using the Lyrist's ability.  

b) No. She can destroy the Engineered Plague, but the pseudo-spell is independent from its source, and will still resolve to kill the Llanowar Elves.  

c) No. The naming of the creature type happens as Engineered Plague comes into play. The elves die as a state based effect, before Laurie has the chance to use activated abilities.


**3. Ingo activates his Treetop Village. He then enchants it with a Rancor. When will the Rancor go to the Graveyard?**


Treetop Village (Land): {1}{G}: ~this~ becomes a 3/3 green creature with trample until end of turn. This creature still counts as a land.  

Rancor (Enchant Creature): Enchanted creature gains +2/+0 and has trample. ; When ~this~ is put into a graveyard from play, return ~this~ to its owner's hand.


a) Since local enchantments don't target the permanent they enchant under 6th Edition Rules, the Rancor will stay until the Treetop Village leaves play.  

b) The Treetop Village will "de-animate" during the Cleanup Step of the End Phase, and the Rancor will then be put into the Graveyard.  

c) Since the Treetop Village is a land, Rancor can't enchant it even when "animated".


**4. Ingo animates his Treetop Village. He then puts a +1/+1 counter on it. When will the counter be removed?**


Treetop Village (Land): {1}{G}: ~this~ becomes a 3/3 green creature with trample until end of turn. This creature still counts as a land.


a) The counter stays on the Treetop Village, even when it deactivates.  

b) Non-creature permanents can't have a power or toughness, so the counter can't be placed on the Treetop Village at all.  

c) Since the Treetop Village is in an "animated state", its allowed to have power and tough ness, but the counters will go away during the Cleanup Step of the End Phase, when the Treetop Village deactivates.  

d) The counter stays and the Treetop Village remains as a 1/1 after the normal animation deactivates.


**5. Ingo uses his Dragon Blood to put a +1/+1 counter on his Spike Feeder. Can the new Counter be used just like the other Counters?**


Dragon Blood (Artifact): {3},{Tap}: Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.  

Spike Feeder (Spike): 0/0. ; ~this~ comes into play with two +1/+1 counters on it. ; {2},Remove a +1/+1 counter from ~this~: Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature. ; Remove a +1/+1 counter from ~this~: You gain 2 life.


a) No, only Spike counters can be used.  

b) Yes, all counters which share the same type are interchangeable.  

c) No, the Feeder will will keep track of which +1/+1's are its own.


**6. Ingo has a 2/2 creature in play. He enchants it with Rancor, and then another Rancor. Laurie then plays Humility. Ingo plays another Rancor on that creature and also gives it a +1/+1 counter. How big is the creature now?**


Rancor (Enchant Creature): Enchanted creature gains +2/+0 and has trample. ; When ~this~ is put into a graveyard from play, return ~this~ to its owner's hand.  

Humility (Enchantment): All creatures lose all abilities and are 1/1.


a) 4/2  

b) 8/2  

c) 3/1  

d) 1/1  

e) 7/1


**7. Ingo has a Juggernaut (Artifact Creature) in play. Laurie plays Disenchant, targeting the Juggernaut. Ingo responds by using his Soul Sculptor to turn the Juggernaut into an enchant ment. Is the Disenchant countered upon resolution?**


Disenchant (Instant): Destroy target artifact or enchantment.


a) Yes. Disenchant is modal, and so was set to artifact when it was played, and so on resolu tion the target is illegal.  

b) No, since the Juggernaut is both an artifact creature, as well as an enchantment.  

c) No. Upon resolution the Juggernaut is still an enchantment or an artifact, so the Disenchant is not countered.


**8. Ingo plays Wildfire. Laurie has a Sacred Ground in play. Will Laurie get her lands back?**


Wildfire (Sorcery): Each player sacrifices four lands. ~this~ deals 4 damage to each creature.  

Sacred Ground (Enchantment): Whenever a spell or ability controlled by an opponent puts a land into your graveyard from play, return that land to play.


a) Laurie makes the choice of which lands to sacrifice, so Sacred Ground won't trigger.  

b) Ingo plays the Wildfire, so Laurie will get her lands back.  

c) Laurie will not get her lands back since she is not the active player.


**9. Ingo controls a Forest enchanted with a Fertile Ground. Laurie controls Fellwar Stone. What color of mana can the Fellwar Stone produce?**


Fertile Ground (Enchant Land): Whenever enchanted land is tapped for mana, it produces an additional one mana of any color.  

Fellwar Stone (Artifact): {Tap}: Add to your mana pool one mana of any color that could be produced by a land an opponent controls.


a) Any color  

b) Only Green  

c) Any color Ingo choses or Green


**10. Ingo has an Opal Archangel in play. Laurie plays a Monk Realist. Can Laurie now destroy the Opal Archangel?**


Opal Archangel (Enchantment): When an opponent plays a creature spell, if ~this~ is an enchantment, ~this~ becomes a 5/5 Angel creature with flying. Attacking does not cause it to tap.  

Monk Realist (Cleric):When ~this~ comes into play, destroy target enchantment.


a) The Opal Archangel triggers on a creature being successfully played, so once Monk Realist comes into play, both the Monk Realist and the Opal Archangel trigger. Laurie puts her pseudo-spell on the stack first, targeting the Opal Archangel, and then Ingo puts his on the stack. Ingo's pseudo-spell resolves first, and the Opal Archangel is now an illegal target, and the Opal Archangel gets to live.  

b) Once the Monk Realist comes into play, the Opal Archangel will immediately be destroyed, since Laurie is active player.  

c) The Opal Archangel will become a creature before the Monk Realist comes into play. It will never be a legal target for the comes into play ability of the Monk Realist.


**11. Ingo sacrifices his Yavimaya Elder to his Altar of Dementia (targeting himself). Which ability resolves first?**


Yamimaya Elder (Druid 2/1): When ~this~ is put into a graveyard from play, you may search your library for up to two basic land cards, reveal them, and put them into your hand. If you do, shuffle your library. ; {2},Sacrifice ~this~: Draw a card.  

Altar of Dementia (Artifact): Sacrifice a creature: Target player puts a number of cards equal to the sacrificed creature's power from the top of his or her library into his or her graveyard.


a) The fetch 2 lands ability of the Yavimaya Elder  

b) The 'milling' ability of the Altar of Dementia  

c) Ingo chooses


**12. Ingo's Elvish Lyrist is enchanted with Pattern of Rebirth. Can he sacrifice the Lyrist to its own ability targeting the Pattern of Rebirth, and still be allowed to search his library to fetch a creature?**


Elvish Lyrist (Elf): {G},{Tap},Sacrifice ~this~: Destroy target enchantment.  

Pattern of Rebirth (Enchant Creature): When enchanted creature is put into a graveyard from play, that creature's controller may search his or her library for a creature card and put that card into play. If that player does, he or she then shuffles his or her library.


a) Yes, since the ability has already triggered before the Pattern of Rebirth leaves play.  

b) No, since the Pattern of Rebirth will be put into the graveyard before it can trigger.  

c) No, the Pattern will be destroyed by the Lyrist effect.


**13. Ingo has an Argothian Enchantress in play. He plays an enchantment, but Laurie counters it with a Counterspell. Will Ingo draw a card from the Argothian Enchantress?**


Argothian Enchantress (Enchantress): Argothian Enchantress can't be the target of spells or abilities. Whenever you play an enchantment spell, draw a card.


a) Yes, since the Argothian Enchantress has already triggered.  

b) No, since the enchantment wasn't successfully played.  

c) Yes, Ingo will draw as soon he announce the enchantment.  

d) No, when Ingo tries to draw, the ability doesn't see the enchantment and counters itself.


**14. Ingo announces playing a Goblin Grenade. Laurie quickly says that she bolts Ingo's only Goblin. Can she do that?**


Goblin Grenade (Sorcery): As an additional cost to play Goblin Grenade, sacrifice a Goblin. Goblin Grenade deals 5 damage to target creature or player.


a) No, since the sacrifice is a part of the cost to play the Goblin Grenade, and the goblin is gone when Laurie receives priority.  

b) Yes, and that will get the Goblin Grenade countered upon resolution, since Ingo can't sacrifice a goblin.  

c) Yes, but Ingo will get the Goblin Grenade back in his hand.


**15. Ingo announces Corpse Dance with Buyback. In response Laurie uses her Thran Foundry on Ingo's graveyard. What happens to the Corpse Dance?**


Corpse Dance (Instant): Buyback 2; Put the top creature card from your graveyard into play. That creature gains haste. Remove the creature from the game at end of turn.  

Thran Foundry (Artifact): 1, T, Remove Thran Foundry from the game: Target player shuffles his or her graveyard into his or her library


a) There is no creature to take now, so the Corpse Dance is countered upon resolution, and is put into the graveyard.  

b) The creature to return to play is locked in on announcement, and so on resolution Ingo searches his library for the creature and puts it into play.  

c) The Corpse Dance sees that there is no creature in the graveyard, does nothing and then returns to its owner's hand.


**16. Ingo uses his Corpse Dance, and puts a Phyrexian Plaguelord in play. Before his End Phase, he sacrifices it. Will the Phyrexian Plaguelord be removed from game?**


Corpse Dance (Instant): Buyback 2; Put the top creature card from your graveyard into play. That creature gains haste. Remove the creature from the game at end of turn.

17. Ingo has a Gaea's Cradle in play. Can Ingo play a second Gaea's Cradle and tap it for mana, before it goes to the graveyard? Gaea's Cradle (Legendary Land): T: Add G to your mana pool for each creature you control.


a) Yes, he can do that.  

b) No, he can't do that.  

c) Yes, if he has not played a land this turn.


18. Ingo plays an Argothian Wurm. Laurie has Sacred Ground in play. Laurie chooses to sacrifice a land to put the Argothian Wurm back on top of Ingo's library. Does she get the land back?


Argothian Wurm (Wurm): When Argothian Wurm comes into play, any player may sacrifice a land. If a player does, put Argothian Wurm on top of its owner's library.  

Sacred Ground (Enchantment): Whenever a spell or ability controlled by an opponent puts a land into your graveyard from play, return that land to play.


a) Laurie controls the ability, so the Sacred Ground won't trigger.  

b) Ingo controls the ability, so the Sacred Ground will trigger.  

c) Ingo controls the ability, but Laurie chooses which land to sacrifice, so the Sacred Ground won't trigger.  

d) The Sacrifice is a cost, so Sacred Ground won't trigger.


**19. Ingo plays Replenish. In his graveyard is a Treachery. Laurie has a tapped Mother of Runes, which has given itself protection from blue. Can Ingo put the Treachy on the Mother of Runes?**


Mother of Runes (Cleric): T: Target creature you control gains protection from the color of your choice until end of turn.  

Traechery (Enchant Creature): When Treachery comes into play, if you played it from your hand, untap up to five lands. You control enchanted creature.


a) Yes, that is legal, but it will "fall off" during the check for state based effects.  

b) No, the Mother is now an illegal enchantee, so he can't put Treachery on the Mother of Runes.  

c) Since local enchantment doesn't target under 6E rules, he can put it on the Mother of Runes, and the Treachery will continue to sit there.  

d) The Treachery is targeted, since it's a local enchantment, and can't be put onto the Mother, since the Mother is an illegal target.


**20. Ingo controls a Gray Ogre (Ogre- 2/2) enchanted with Gaea's Embrace. Laurie plays Humble on the Ogre, and it resolves. Laurie then proceeds to play Shock targeting the Gray Ogre.**


Gaea's Embrace (Enchant Creature): Enchanted creature gets +3/+3 and has trample. G: Regenerate enchanted creature.

Shock (Instant): Shock deals 2 damage to target creature or player.


**1) Can Ingo make a regeneration shield in response?**


a) Yes.  

b) No, since the Ogre has no abilities until end of turn.  

c) Yes, but the shield will do nothing since the Ogre has no abilities when the Shock resolves.


**2) If he made a regeneration shield in response to the Humble, will the Gray Ogre regenerate?**


a) Yes, the shield will replace the Ogre's destruction.  

b) No, since the Humble has wiped out the regeneration shield.  

c) He can't respond to Humble, as the Shock will have to resolve before he can activate the regeneration ability.


**21. Ingo has a Forest in play. He then plays a Conversion. After that, Laurie plays Phantasmal Terrain on the Forest, naming Mountain. Is the Forest now:**

c) 0 since the Mother of Runes will prevent all the damage, before any trample damage can spill over.

Laurie has a Grizzly Bear and Ingo has an Avalanche Rider in play, which he will have to pay Echo for this turn. This Upkeep Step, can Ingo refuse to pay the Echo for the Avalanche Riders, and because he has fewer creatures in pay than Laurie, use the Oath of Druids?**


Oath of Druids (Enchantment): At the beginning of each player's upkeep, if that player controls fewer creatures than an opponent, the player may reveal cards from the top of his or her library until he or she reveals a creature card. The player puts that creature into play and all other cards revealed this way into his or her graveyard.  

Grizzly Bear (Bear - 2/2)  

Avalanche Riders (Nomad): Haste; Echo; When Avalanche Riders comes into play, destroy target land.


a) Yes, when the Oath of Druids ability resolves it checks the number of creatures in play, and Ingo can use the Oath of Druids' ability to get a creature from his library.  

b) No, the Oath of Druids will not trigger at the start of the upkeep as Ingo didn't have fewer creatures than Laurie.  

c) No, Echo must be put on the stack before begining of upkeep effects, so the Avalanche Riders are still in play when the Oath ability resolves.

c) Yes, since they're in the same batch.  

d) Yes, all damage to Laurie from the Pestilence will be prevented until the end of turn.


**36. Ingo activates his Coffin Queen, targeting a Shivan Dragon. In response to the activation, Laurie plays Shock, targeting the Coffin Queen. Once the Shivan Dragon comes in play, will it then get to stay there, or will the Coffin Queen's ability remove it from the game?**
