Mattias Jorstedt vs. Andre Mueller
----------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpzur04/fm2_1.jpg)The byes are over. The Pro Tour big names finally get to shuffle up their decks. To start things off the always silent Mattias against the always loud Andre Mueller.


### Game 1


They playerd "land-go" for a while, with the Swede missing his third land drop. To find it he blew a [Tel-Jilad Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Justice) on a [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) (just to "scry"). He found a [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) but couldn't find another land.


The German kept on playing [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s and Ingots. Then he played [March of the Machines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines). That gave him two monsters (the [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot)s). A draw step later, still at seventeen Mattias decided he had had enough.


Andre: "Mana screw..."


Andre 1-0 Mattias.


### Game 2


Again Andre played a first turn [Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), but this time Jorstedt had the tools to avoid the screw. He played second turn [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) (for [Stalking Stones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones)), third turn [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) to get it back.


The Witness started swinging and Mueller used [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), followed by [Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) to find some answers. He settled on playing his own [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost).


Mattias: "Hmmm... technology."


The silent Swede played a second Witness to get his overworked Scrying back.


Andre: "The beats, the beats."


That was just the invitation Mattias was looking for. He thought for a while, activated his [Stalking Stones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones) and dropped the German to nine. A turn later, the German picked up his cards.


Andre: "Your game."


Andre 1-1 Mattias.


### Game 3


They dropped mana until Mattias dropped Troll Astetic. The German seemed unfazed and kept on his "card drawing" ways, with a [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge). The Swede walked [Molder Slug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Slug) into a [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend). That powered out [March of the Machines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines), which turned the [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) into a Troll-stopper.


Mattias took the opening to play a second Slug. This one stuck... until the end of turn. Then [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) sent it away. The Swede tried in again, this time meeting [Last Word](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Word).


The German was slowly regaining control of the table, and played a second Ingot. Jorstedt tried to answer with his [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) before playing a second Troll.


Mueller sent his artifact-turned-creature crew in... sneaking three damage past the Trolls. His opponent stared at the table nervously and fired a [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpzur04/fm2_2.jpg)The German thought about it... and allowed it with a smile. Out came [Duplicant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant) and [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness). The [Duplicant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant) took out a [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot), dying in the process, to Mattias' surprise.


[Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) gave Mueller zero help and a Thirst of Knowledge in response to Mattias Jorstedt's next [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) also came up empty. The German shook his head, cursed his sideboarding and scooped.


Final result:  

Mattias 2-1 Andre.
