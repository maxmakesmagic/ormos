**Card of the Day - lundi 31 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Last%20Chance)#### Last Chance


 *Portal* rare. While designing the *Portal*  and *Starter*  sets, R&D had to look at what cards could be brought over to a format where there are only sorceries and creatures. Last Chance is actually a *Portal*  version of Final Fortune, and it’s a good example of how drastically a spell's power level can change when moved from instant to sorcery. 
 



**Card of the Day - vendredi 28 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gaze%20of%20the%20Gorgon)#### Gaze of the Gorgon


 *Ravnica* common. During the early design process R&D examined all of the different abilities in the game and which colors they were associated with, to identify areas of potential overlap for each of the guilds. As this card illustrates, both the basilisk ability and regeneration show up primarily in black and green. 
 



**Card of the Day - jeudi 27 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sisters%20of%20Stone%20Death)#### Sisters of Stone Death


 *Ravnica* rare. When designing complex creatures with multiple abilities, one of the important challenges is to make sure that all of the abilities interact in interesting ways and in a fashion that makes sense as a whole. Sisters of Stone Death manages to pull this off with not just two, but three different abilities. 
 



**Card of the Day - mercredi 26 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Putrefy)#### Putrefy


 *Ravnica* uncommon. Because gold cards often naturally lend themselves to complexity, one of the challenges to designing these kinds of cards is also coming up with good, simple effects, such as Terminate from *Planeshift*. 
 



**Card of the Day - mardi 25 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Golgari%20Germination)#### Golgari Germination


 *Ravnica* uncommon. Note that cards like this are made to only trigger off of nontoken creatures to prevent them from creating an infinite loop combo that would be far too easy to set up. 
 



**Card of the Day - lundi 24 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Grave-Shell%20Scarab)#### Grave-Shell Scarab


 *Ravnica* rare. This card was called "Super Blinky" during playtesting, because the combination of dredge with the ability to draw a card made this creature feel very much like the nearly unkillable Blinking Spirit. The similarity also wasn't lost on Mike Flores, who titled his preview article on the card Blinky's Revenge.
 



**Card of the Day - vendredi 21 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mangara's%20Equity)#### Mangara's Equity


 *Mirage* uncommon. Several proper names in **Magic** are actually anagrams of other words. The *Mirage* team decided to poke fun at that habit by creating Mangara, which is an anagram of "anagram."
 



**Card of the Day - jeudi 20 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wall%20of%20Roots)#### Wall of Roots


 *Mirage* common. In one of the most bizarre rules issues ever, a deck showed up at a PTQ in ’98 built around using Wall of Roots infinite times “between turns”. Because it was nobody’s turn, you could use the ability as many times as you wanted (or so the argument went). Stasis was used to skip your untap phase, at which point Magma Mine was used to kill off the bewildered opponent. The deck was named “Wall of Boom” - and was quickly killed off by rules clarifications. 
 



**Card of the Day - mercredi 19 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Foratog)#### Foratog


 *Mirage* uncommon. During set design this card wasn't originally an Atog! When it was realized that it *could* be an Atog, a cycle was created which had one new Atog per set until all five colors had been represented. The other three (not counting the original "Atog") were Chronatog, Necratog, and finally Auratog. 
 



**Card of the Day - mardi 18 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ersatz%20Gnomes)#### Ersatz Gnomes


 *Mirage* uncommon. Like all other artifact Gnomes, Ersatz Gnomes have retroactively been given the creature type "Gnome."
 



**Card of the Day - lundi 17 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Zirilan%20of%20the%20Claw)#### Zirilan of the Claw


 *Mirage* rare. Ziliran was actually in the *Scourge*  file as a wacky reprint to help the Dragon theme… until someone pointed out that he was on the Reserve List and thus was not eligible to reprint.
 



**Card of the Day - vendredi 14 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sacred%20Foundry)#### Sacred Foundry


 *Ravnica* rare. **Magic** design has been trying out new variations on the original dual lands since the days of *Ice Age*. The idea behind this cycle was to combine the strengths of two different land cycles: *Invasion's* tap lands (like Coastal Tower) and the cycle of painlands from *Ice Age* and *Apocalypse* (like Adarkar Wastes and Battlefield Forge). By giving players the ability to choose when playing these lands they become more valuable for both aggressive and controlling decks. 
 



**Card of the Day - jeudi 13 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dimir%20Guildmage)#### Dimir Guildmage


 *Ravnica* uncommon. There are many different ways to unify a cycle of cards. In the *Mirage* guildmage cycle, each card had an off-color ability, one for each allied color of the guildmage's color. Also, the ability offered by a color of mana was the same on any other guildmage that had that ability. So, for example, both guildmages allied to white had the same tap ability for white mana. For *Ravnica*, the guildmages offer one ability for each color in their guild, but their abilities are different from other guildmages that share a color, to reflect the guilds' different philosophies regarding those colors. 
 



**Card of the Day - mercredi 12 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Savra,%20Queen%20of%20the%20Golgari)#### Savra, Queen of the Golgari


 *Ravnica* rare. An interesting thing about Savra is that, though she triggers specifically off of creature sacrifice, she doesn't actually give you any way to sacrifice creatures. That she is at her best when your creatures are dying, and giving you life in the process, ties right into the flavor of the Golgari.
 



**Card of the Day - mardi 11 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hunted%20Dragon)#### Hunted Dragon


 *Ravnica* rare. The idea for this popular card came from Richard Garfield. It worked out so well that it inspired an entire cycle of cards, one per color. 
 



**Card of the Day - lundi 10 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Faith's%20Fetters)#### Faith's Fetters


 *Ravnica* common. The white member of the five-card "comes-into-play" cycle of auras, this one is unique because it's the only one that can enchant any permanent rather than just creatures. Originally, this card was just like the other four, but its scope was moved to "enchant permanent" to make the effect more versatile and, in the process, more interesting for constructed play. 
 



**Card of the Day - vendredi 7 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Autochthon%20Wurm)#### Autochthon Wurm


 *Ravnica* rare. Double-digit colorless mana costs are quite rare in **Magic**. In fact, there have been only nine such cards printed so far: Aladdin's Lamp, Stratadon, Darksteel Colossus, Mycosynth Golem, Blinkmoth Infusion, Mox Lotus, Draco, Autochthon Wurm, and the undisputed king of meaty casting costs - the mighty Gleemax. Aladdin's Lamp is a special case because, due to typesetting issues back in the days of *Arabian Nights*, "10" couldn't be shown as one symbol. It was instead shown as ![ Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/55.gif%0A%09%09%09), which caused quite a bit of confusion and was corrected starting when the card was reprinted in the *Revised* edition. 
 



**Card of the Day - jeudi 6 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Selesnya%20Evangel)#### Selesnya Evangel


 *Ravnica* common. During early design, the token producers in *Ravnica* actually produced saprolings that were green/white, to match the guild that created them. However, once the structure for how the entire block would be put together was decided, the Selesnya token creatures were changed to just green. The exact reason why will have to wait until after the next two sets have been revealed. 
 



**Card of the Day - mercredi 5 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Selesnya%20Sagittars)#### Selesnya Sagittars


 *Ravnica* uncommon. Created by choosing two abilities, one of which is associated with each color that makes it up, R&D calls these "Chinese Menu" cards (choosing one option from Column A and one from Column B). Note that while in Alpha the ability to block multiple creatures originally appeared in red (Two-Headed Giant of Foriys) and white (Blaze of Glory), the ability now appears almost exclusively on white cards. 
 



**Card of the Day - mardi 4 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Watchwolf)#### Watchwolf


 *Ravnica* uncommon. Though 230 different creatures have been printed in gold border so far, very few of them are simply "vanilla" (no rules text), and many of those are poorly regarded cards from *Legends*. Just as Isamaru, Hound of Konda was printed to show that vanilla legends could be interesting, Watchwolf was created to show that multi-colored vanilla creatures could also be interesting. 
 



**Card of the Day - lundi 3 octobre 2005** 


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Glare%20of%20Subdual)#### Glare of Subdual


 *Ravnica* rare. Though its predecessor Opposition was blue, Glare of Subdual was printed as a green-white card for flavor reasons. Strategically, the Selesnya guild seeks to gain position on an opponent by achieving superiority in numbers and then using that superiority to put the game away. The way this card allows creatures to work together to accomplish goals is a perfect fit for the Conclave.
