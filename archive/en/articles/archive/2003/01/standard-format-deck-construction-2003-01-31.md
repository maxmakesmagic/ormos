*Updated February 24, 2014*

Constructed decks must contain a minimum of sixty cards. There is no maximum deck size; however, you must be able to shuffle your deck with no assistance. If a player wishes to use a sideboard, it must have fifteen or less cards.

With the exception of basic land cards, a player’s combined deck and sideboard may not contain more than four of any individual card, counted by its English card title equivalent. All cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest are basic.

The following card sets are permitted in Standard tournaments:

* *Return to Ravnica*
* *Gatecrash*
* *Dragon's Maze*
* ***Magic** 2014*
* *Theros*
* *Born of the Gods*
* *Journey Into Nyx* (effective May 2, 2014)

  
There are no cards banned in Standard tournaments.
