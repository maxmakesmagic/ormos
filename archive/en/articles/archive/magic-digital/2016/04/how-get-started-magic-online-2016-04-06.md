 By night, Gaby streams Magic on Twitch. By day, she's co-founder and VP of Content at Dose, the Chicago-based media company behind Dose.com and OMGFacts.com. 






This video is intended for *Magic* players who have never tried *Magic Online* or who have not played for a long time. *Magic Online* has undergone a lot of changes recently—most notably the reintroduction of Leagues that allow you to play on your schedule—making this as good a time as any to jump in.


The video below will show you how to sign up and create an account with *Magic Online*, plus some of the basics of getting set up and playing. You can find some helpful links here, and then watch the video below.


Enjoy!
