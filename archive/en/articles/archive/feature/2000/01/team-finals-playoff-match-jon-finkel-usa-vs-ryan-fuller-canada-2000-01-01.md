 In what looked to be Team Canada's best match up, Pro Tour veteran Gab Tsang faced off against newcomer Frank Hernandez in a dual of National team third chairs. The match up, which judging by the archetypes would normally favor Hernandez, looked good for Tsang because of a sideboard loaded with Submerges and Somnophores, both excellent cards against the American's deck.
