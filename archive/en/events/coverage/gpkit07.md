===================================

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpkit07/Closing-Blurb.jpg)Junya Iyanaga piloted his controlling Blue/White deck through a star-studded Top 8 here at Grand Prix Kitakyūshū this weekend, defeating Grand Prix playoff veterans such as Shouta Yasooka and Olivier Ruel. Ruel had his own victory this weekend too, achieving Level 6 status within the Pro Players Club and keeping his hopes alive in the Player of the Year race. With only one more Grand Prix stop between here and the World Championships in New York in a month's time, PoY hopefuls are going to have their best game faces on for Daytona Beach next weekend. Tune in here next weekend and we'll keep you updated with who is still in the running as they round the last corner and make a b-line for the finish.
