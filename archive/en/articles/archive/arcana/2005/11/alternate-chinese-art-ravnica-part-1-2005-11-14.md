Your [Dimir style guide Arcana](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/944) has me thinking - what alternate art (if any) was used in China for these skeletal sneaks? In particular, the obviously fleshless House Guard?

Clever choice of words, Jonathan. Yes, it's true, we've [mentioned before](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/50) in a [couple Arcanas](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/93) that Chinese regulations require that skeletons not appear in the art of **Magic** cards distributed there. Hence, many illustrations are touched up or re-commissioned for a set's Chinese printings.

Here are some examples of the alternate art found on Chinese printings of *Ravnica* cards.

![Dimir House Guard](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/AltArt_DHG.jpg)

[Dimir House Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+House+Guard) is a clear example of a card with skeletons in the art. In this case, some skin was added to the main figure, and even to the smaller figures that are barely visible at card size. The creature is still a gruesome, zombielike monster -- but it's no longer a bare skeleton.

![Woodwraith Strangler](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/AltArt_Woodwraith.jpg)

[Woodwraith Strangler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodwraith+Strangler) may be a less obvious case of skeleton art, but its bare-skull face still needed modification. You can see the result here -- a bit of skin over the nose and cheekbones, some filled eye sockets, and some lips over those snaggly teeth, and voila: a Chinese-legal image.

Stay tuned to Magic Arcana for more Chinese alternate *Ravnica* art later this month.
