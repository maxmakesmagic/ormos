![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/mistformultimuswatch.jpg)It's been just over a year since the last time we [checked in on](/en/articles/archive/mistform-ultimus-watch-%E2%80%93-morningtide-edition-2008-01-21) our old friend [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus). Last time we saw good ol' Ultimus, there were 215 relevant creature types. And that certainly seems like a lot. Since then, *Shadowmoor, Eventide, Shards of Alara,* and *Conflux* have come out. Let's take a look at the current list, shall we?

Hey, waaaait a minute. That's only 216! There's only one creature type that's been added. And to save you the effort of squinting at the list muttering things like "Advisor? Where's that from?" we'll tell you that the new type is "Noggle". Also, there are [29 Advisors in **Magic**](http://beta.gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&type=advisor%7C%7Csubtype%3dadvisor). One of them is [Gaddock Teeg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg)! Anyway, there you go. Noggles.


...


So, since we've got you here, and since Noggles have come up, it might be worthwhile to answer a question that's been flooding in ever since the first Noggle poked its donkey-like nose into **Magic**. Namely, "Are Noggles the same thing as Donkeyfolk? Or what?"


To answer this question, we're going to turn to *Un-* Rules Manager Mark Rosewater, who answered this question while [writing Savor the Flavor](/en/articles/archive/art-appreciation-jeremy-jarvis-2008-07-23) in the guise of The Mimic last July.

> > One of the things I’m really enjoying about *Shadowmoor* and *Eventide* is the introduction of so many new races/creature types. One of them that you haven’t touched much upon yet is the noggle. I’m writing in because my friends and I have been discussing the noggles and I have two questions. One, what Celtic mythological influence do they stem from? And two, haven’t we seen them before? Weren’t the donkeyfolk from *Unhinged* really noggles?

> Steven, I’ll start with the easy question first. The noggles are creatures of Scottish mythology also known as neugles, nuggles and nygels. Traditionally they are water spirits that take the form of a horse. The distinctive feature about them is that they have an odd tail that curls like a wheel over their back. Any unsuspecting victim that attempts to ride the horse finds that he cannot dismount and is taken to the sea. The creatures do not always drown their rider, though, as they are often merely mischievous. Noggles had a peculiarity for messing with water-mills and were often blamed as the reason for a mill malfunctioning. Obviously, the donkey/horse creature was merely an inspiration for *Eventide*‘s concepting team, and the creature that shows up in the set is quite removed from the noggles of lore.

> As to whether the donkeyfolk of *Unhinged* fame are noggles, it’s far less clear. The *Un-*sets break all lot of rules including those of flavor continuity. The Creative team doesn’t bother to answer questions such as whether Richard Garfield actually exists within the **Magic** multiverse. If you put them side by side...

Both have a donkey head and donkey arms and legs, but the *Unhinged* donkeyfolk seem to have much more human proportions while the noggles are much more squat. I will go out on a limb and say that the donkeyfolk from *Unhinged* are not from the plane of Lorwyn / Shadowmoor.

Thanks, Doug! Er, Mr. Mimic. That is, "Thanks, Mark!"
