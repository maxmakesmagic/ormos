DAY 1 COVERAGE



The Eldritch Moon is fading, and the rising sun of Ixalan is set to take its place. That’s the scene as we enter Grand Prix Washington D.C., the final event of the Standard season and the swan song of *Shadows Over Innistrad* and *Eldritch Moon,* as well as *Battle for Zendikar* and *Oath of the Gatewatch.*


Soon we’ll say goodbye to the Zombies and Eldrazi of those worlds, and say a friendly greeting to the Merfolk and Pirates of Ixalan (and maybe a not-so-friendly one to the fearsome Dinosaurs looming).


But first things first – one last Standard showdown in the nation’s capital. We’re coming off the heels of a pair of incredible accomplishments. The first is the brother duo of Brad Nelson and Corey Baumeister, who made the Top 8 of back-to-back Standard Grand Prix together, the first time in *Magic* history such a feat has been accomplished. It’s also the first event since the unprecedented dominance of the Temur Energy deck that the duo plus Brian Braun-Duin all played to Top 4 finishes.


That certainly makes things interesting this weekend. Can the wild run continue for Nelson and Baumeister? Newly solidified as the top deck in Standard, will Temur Energy stay on top or the will the rise of sideboarded Solemnity shut it down? With a diverse Standard format and a large field, the next two days are sure to be exciting.


Tune into Twitch.tv/Magic for full coverage.
