The [***Magic** 2010* Prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases) is just around the corner! Unless you're reading this on the weekend, in which case it's happening *right now*! This doesn't really have much to do with this cool wallpaper, but we just thought we'd mention it. Anyway, here's Alluring Siren by Chippy. Enjoy!


And be sure to scroll down for the final installment of Core Set Survivor!

### Core Set Survivor!


There are exactly sixteen cards that have been in every core set from *Alpha* to *Tenth Edition*. When ***Magic** 2010* comes out, only *eight* cards will have been in every core set. Over the weeks before the ***Magic** 2010* prerelease, we've been counting them down in this special Arcana sub-feature, giving you an "IN" or "OUT" on one card a day. And it all comes down to this. Two cards remain. [Rod of Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rod+of+Ruin) and [Scathe Zombies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scathe+Zombies). One will be in, and one will be out.
