### What’s Changed the Most About Standard Since the Pro Tour?


**![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/gpoak16/QQ---Lax.jpg)**


**Ari Lax** – “We’ve found a home for all the good stuff. All the stuff we thought were broken, people have made it work. There’s the best [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) deck, the best [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) deck. We’ve optimized.”

**(HoF) Patrick Chapin** – “Abzan, Jeskai, and Esper got streamlined. At the Pro Tour, very few people knew how to build them well. Now the metagame has warped around the tuned versions of those three. So there have been some weird decks showing up like Eldrazi and Rally doing well.”

**Matt Sperling –** “The impact of [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths) really is the story. At the Pro Tour, people properly predicted there would be a lot of red, and [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths) is bad against Red. But since then, the ecosystem has shifted away from that, and people have adjusted to losing three life for three cards.”


“Also, [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) has become incredibly good. This set made it easier to get double-white in a multicolor deck, and plus you can get a dual with it too.”

**(24) Craig Wescoe – “**Green-White Megamorph completely dropped off the map. [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) isn’t what it used to be. [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) is a real problem, and other decks can keep up with its graveyard shenanigans. And [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors) really started to do well. That’s because someone finally figured out the *good* Rally deck. At the Pro Tour it wasn’t there yet; it just took some time. “

**(9) Alex Hayne – “**Ramp got real good. All the other decks have gotten grind-ier, and Ramp tries to go over the top of people who care about drawing three cards.”

**(HoF) Brian Kibler** **& (HoF) Ben Rubin** –


Ben Rubin immediately jumps in, “Painful Truths!”


Kibler agreed completely. “Absolutely. Since the format’s moved toward efficiency, Painful Truth has been extremely important. I was playing at the Pro Tour but people didn’t quite know how to build with it and all the new dual lands.”  

Rubin added, “Well, *some* of us didn’t.” He pat Kibler on the back.
