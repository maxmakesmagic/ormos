After last weekend's epic series of Grand Prix, the GP circuit is taking a weekend off. However, that doesn't mean there's a shortage of *Magic* for you to watch over the next few days!


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/Week7_Bracket.jpg)


We're headed into Week 7 of the [Standard Super League](http://StandardSuperLeague.com/), and at this point, Owen Turtenwald has a lock on the playoffs. In fact, he's close to a lock for first seed as it stands, and last week's finals appearance only continued to improve his stance! Meanwhile, because of Brad Nelson's win last week, that leaves Brian Kibler in last place. He'll need a big finish over the next two weekends or he will find himself on the league chopping block!


As Owen cements his status as top dog, will Gerry Thompson, Paul Cheon, and Tom Ross be able to hold on to their leads for the Top 4, or will Brad Nelson and Josh Utter-Leyton threaten their chances in the next weeks?


Join hosts Randy Buehler and Luis Scott-Vargas for commentary of next week's Standard Super League. The matches get going every Tuesday at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET/1 a.m. UTC on the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic)!

This weekend's Modern showcase can be found at the [StarCityGames.com Invitational in Columbus](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/050615_columbus_fact_sheet.html) this weekend. It's the first time an SCG Invitational highlights Modern, and it will be played alongside Standard by the event's qualified competitors. As the Invitationals bring out some big players, who of those players will win the $10,000 first place prize, trophy, and invitation to SCG's Players' Championship?


Join Patrick Sullivan, Cedric Phillips, and Mattias Hunt as they bring you three days of Columbus coverage starting today at 8:30 a.m. PT/11:30 a.m ET/3:30 p.m. UTC on the [SCGLive Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/scglive). Coverage of Day Two starts Saturday at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET/1 p.m. UTC, and Top 8 coverage starts Sunday at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET/2 p.m. UTC.

Join Marshall Sutcliffe and Frank Lepore as they bring you live coverage of both days of the MaxPoint Invitational! It all starts Saturday at 12 p.m. PT/3 p.m. ET/7 p.m. UTC on the [GGSLive Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/tcgplayer#_blank). Coverage of Day Two begins on Sunday at the same times.
