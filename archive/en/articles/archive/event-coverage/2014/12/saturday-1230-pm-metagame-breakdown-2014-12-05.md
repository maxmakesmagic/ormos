Three rounds of Standard have concluded and players are moving into their Draft Pods as we speak. While they get busy deciding their picks, let us take a quick glimpse at the metagame right here.


39 players have decided to play with Primeval Titans to go along with their Valakut, the Molten Pinnacles while 37 blue-black mages have opted to go against them, preferring to run Spreading Seas and Tectonic Edges alongside their countermagic and suite of removal spells. Both these two archetypes alone make up slightly more than half the field.

The format is not without innovation though. We see 11 players choosing to attack with little red men (Goblins) and another 11 choosing to attack with little black men (Vampires), all accompanied with efficient burn or spot removal. Assembling lethal combos is still a viable strategy. Splinter Twin continues to threaten turn four kills, while some Tezzerators prefer to kill their opponents with Blightsteel Colossus! Many rogue decks litter the field as well, but only time will tell which are the good ones which float to the top!
