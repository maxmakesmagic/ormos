Showcase Last Chance Events July 31–August 3
--------------------------------------------


Following Showcase Challenge Weekend, your next opportunity to continue toward qualification for the Season 2 MOCS are the Last Chance Events. From Sunday afternoon through next Wednesday morning Pacific time, Preliminaries in the four Showcase Qualifier formats (Modern, Pioneer, Pauper, and Legacy) are replaced with Last Chance tournaments.


These five-round events cost either 30 Event Tickets plus 40 Qualifier Points, or 300 Play Points plus 40 QPs to enter. If you win all five matches, you will earn an Entry Token good for that format's Showcase Qualifier next month.


Note that Limited, Standard, and Vintage Preliminaries during this period will fire normally.


Learn more about Last Chance events [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/mocs-step-1-showcase-challenges-last-chance-events).

Showcase Challenge Weekend
--------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend.


These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and, starting with this season, invitations to the 2023 World Championship!


On Saturday, July 30, we have the Pauper Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (15:00), and we finish things off on Sunday, July 31, with the Legacy Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (15:00).


Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in August.

Update: Season 2 QPs Expiration
-------------------------------


Due to the success of the 20th Anniversary Series, there are a larger-than-normal number of accounts that still have lots of Season 2 Qualifier Points. Those QPs were due to expire next week.


As a one-time change, we are going to extend the validity of those Season 2 QPs for two extra weeks to August 17! This permits you to continue entering Limited Preliminaries from August 3–17.


There are three types of events that accept these as entry:


* Limited Preliminaries featuring *Double Masters 2022* (see item below):
	+ Through August 2, QP prizes will be Season 2.
	+ Starting August 3, QP prizes will be Season 3, usable only for other event types as normal.
		- Season 3 Premier event schedules will be posted next week.
* Showcase Challenges July 30–31 (see item above)
* [Showcase Last Chance Events](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/mocs-step-1-showcase-challenges-last-chance-events) July 31–August 3

Change Log
----------


* [Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kroxa%2C+Titan+of+Death%27s+Hunger) will correctly not cause life loss when a double-faced card with a land on its back face ([Shatterskull Smashing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatterskull+Smashing), etc.) is discarded.
* While [Trinisphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere) is on the battlefield, players will correctly be able to cast spells with casting cost XX when X equals either 0 or 1.
* Cards in exile that are foretold will correctly be revealed to all players at the end of the game.
* If [Skyclave Apparition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyclave+Apparition) leaves the battlefield after it had exiled multiple permanents (usually due to meld, mutate, or [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon)), it will correctly produce tokens with non-zero power and toughness.
* If you keep the same target for effects that change the target of a spell or ability, the game will correctly not trigger "becomes the target" abilities.
