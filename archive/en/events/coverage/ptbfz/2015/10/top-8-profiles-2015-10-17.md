**![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/ptbfz/t8_damodarosa.jpg)Name:** Paulo Vitor Damo Da Rosa


**Age:** 28


**Hometown:** Porto Alegre, Brazil


**Occupation:** *Magic* player and writer for ChannelFireball.com


**Limited Record:** 6-0


**Constructed Record:** 6-3-1


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** Ten Pro Tour Top 8s!


**What Standard deck are you playing and why?**


Atarka Red. It's so much faster than anything else, and the format is kind of clunky with people playing four colors.


**What *Battle for Zendikar* card impressed you the most this weekend?**


[Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames), I guess. I'm not playing many *Battle for Zendikar* cards myself, but that one was good every time someone cast it versus me.


**Who did you prepare for the tournament with?**


The [Face to Face](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Face+to+Face) guys: Alexander Hayne, Jon Stern, Nathan Holiday, Josh McClain, Shuhei Nakamura, Sam Pardee, Mike Sigrist, Neal Oliver, and Tyler Bloom.


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


It'd show me I can still compete at the highest level.

**Occupation:** Hedge Fund Manager


**Limited Record:** 4-2

Heh.


**What Standard deck are you playing and why?**


Jeskai Black, because the battle lands from *Battle for Zendikar* shored up its greatest weakness, big ground creatures. It let the deck play [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom) and Tasigur.


**What *Battle for Zendikar* card impressed you the most this weekend?**


Battle lands.

The Pantheon.

I'd have more than half the Pro Tour wins Kai Budde has.

[Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar).

A friend in my hometown and I practiced drafting on *Magic Online*.
