Born of the Gods Game Day and Challenge Deck
============================================



 Posted in **Daily Deck**
 on February 25, 2014 










This weekend, stores across the globe are running *Born of the Gods* Game Day, a day-long Standard tournament. They are also running the sixth quest in the Hero's Path, with the Battle the Horde Challenge Deck. 

Game Day Tournament
 Bring your favorite [Standard deck](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrstandard) and do battle! 

 Each participant will receive a [Kiora's Follower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%27s+Follower) promo card (while supplies last), while those who make the Top 8 will also get a [Pain Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain+Seer) promo card (while supplies last). Find a store near you with the [store locator](http://locator.wizards.com/). 

And if you're competing in that tournament, you'll happen to handily have a Standard deck at the ready to...

Battle the Horde Challenge Deck
Brave heroes, your Hero's Path continues this weekend! A horde of minotaurs threatens Akros, and the polis needs you!

 Battle the Horde is the sixth quest in the Hero's Path, which occurs this weekend, March 1â€“2, at the [*Born of the Gods* Game Day](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/gameday-facts).

 Bring your favorite deck with you to Battle the Horde, including the Standard deck you bring to play in the Game Day tournament! (But no, you don't have to join the tournament to perform the sixth Hero's Path quest.) Regardless of the deck you bring, you may also play with *up to three* Hero Cards you've collected from previous Hero's Path quests. 

 Once you finish your quest, your tournament organizer will provide you with your Game Day Hero Card, The Vanquisher:

 Dave Guskin, wise seer and experience game designer, has answered questions you might have about [Challenge Decks](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/HerosPathFAQ#challenge) in general and [Battle the Horde](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/HerosPathFAQ#battle) specifically, both of which are in the overall [Hero's Path FAQ](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/HerosPathFAQ). 

We know some players will want to bring home their own horde against which to do battle, and fortunately for you, stores will have Challenge Decks for sale starting with the Game Day event this weekend!
