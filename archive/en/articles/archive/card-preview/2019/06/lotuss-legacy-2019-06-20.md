A while ago, we printed a cheap artifact. You might have heard of it.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Black+Lotus)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)
Powerful, iconic, and desirable, [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) never saw print again after *Unlimited Edition*. But the *feeling* that Lotus invoked, the specialness of it, became something we have revisited from time to time.


The first such attempt was also, arguably, the most unintentionally powerful:


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond)
Here, we tried to evoke the *ability* of [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), but not the flavor. It wasn't a huge hit at the time, as the card needed a deeper card pool to become the powerhouse it is today.


Next up was a card that was another take on producing three mana. It also started the trend of naming cards after the OG power flower to evoke that special feeling of playing a *Lotus*.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lotus+Vale)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Vale)
Due to the wording on the card and the rules at various points in the game's history, the card actually occasionally functioned like a [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), depending on the oracle wording and the rules at the time. Those windows were slim, but the card remains powerful. I play it in several Commander decks—from a land-focused [Tatyova, Benthic Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tatyova%2C+Benthic+Druid) deck to a Bant deck that simply gets value out of a land that taps for more than one mana. Of course, it was always possible that a [Strip Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strip+Mine), [Stone Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain), [Sinkhole](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinkhole), or [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) just absolutely ruined your day.


The card was a hit, and more Lotuses followed. Although some were better than others, they all met with just a bit of that *feeling* the name evokes.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lotus+Petal)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lotus+Bloom)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gilded+Lotus)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus)
[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lotus+Guardian)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Guardian) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mox+Lotus)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Lotus)
Today's preview card harkens back to that first attempt at a Lotus land and does it cleaner, but still just as powerfully—without the risk. Or at least not as much. Introducing Lotus Field.


![Lotus Field](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_mLt8FEhO42.png)


Between this and [Gilded Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus), there are a *lot* of powerful ways to generate three mana of a single color in Standard right now.


But why would you want this card over, say, a random land? It doesn't produce extra mana (since you have to sacrifice two lands) and it comes into play tapped. It seems like a very pretty way to play a land tapped.


There are, however, multiple ways to make this card work for you. In Commander, there are basically 8,000 ways to do so, but even Standard has its fair share.


For example, how about untapping this gorgeous Field with one of these:


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kiora%2C+Behemoth+Beckoner)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+Behemoth+Beckoner) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blossom+Dryad)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blossom+Dryad)
[Blossom Dryad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blossom+Dryad) isn't setting the world on fire these days, but Kiora isn't far off playable, and with six mana at your disposal, you're certainly able to play creatures that trigger Kiora's static ability with ease. Imagine this simple scenario:


Turn 1: Forest, [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves)  

Turn 2: Forest, [Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+Behemoth+Beckoner)  

Turn 3: Tap both Forests to float two mana, play Lotus Field, untap Lotus Field with Kiora, have six mana at your disposal


That's without trying terribly hard. And on turn four with another land drop, you have eight mana ready to go. I'll leave it up to you to figure out what to do from there.


And even though [Blossom Dryad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blossom+Dryad) isn't a good card outside of Limited, note that it can let Lotus Field act as something of an awkward [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), by untapping it to use the mana before you have to sacrifice any lands.


But there are other ways to use it as well. For example, try pairing it with [Crucible of Worlds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+Worlds), essentially negating its drawback. Pair it with [The Mending of Dominaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Mending+of+Dominaria) to supercharge your mana base. Flip this into play with [Elvish Rejuvenator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Rejuvenator). Grow [Multani, Yavimaya's Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Multani%2C+Yavimaya%27s+Avatar) or recycle the dead lands with [Molderhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molderhulk). Or go wild and throw [Awakening of Vitu-Ghazi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening+of+Vitu-Ghazi) on it to make a 9/9 hexproof creature.


Dip into Modern and you have [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) and the *Modern Horizons* star [Wrenn and Six](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrenn+and+Six). Commander already has access to [Lotus Vale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Vale), but any deck that wants one will certainly be happy to have a second that's less vulnerable to [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland), [Strip Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strip+Mine), and [Field of Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+of+Ruin). There, you can pair it with [Deserted Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deserted+Temple); [Kiora's Follower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%27s+Follower); [Nissa, Vital Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Vital+Force); or [Magus of the Candelabra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Candelabra), among others.


However you choose to play it, Lotus Field is going to feel special every time it hits the battlefield.
