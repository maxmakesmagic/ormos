The 2019 Tabletop *Magic* Mythic Championship I, our first Mythic Series event of 2019, takes place February 22â€“24 as part of [MagicFest Cleveland](https://www.cfbevents.com/mtgcleveland).


Mythic Championship Cleveland will feature sixteen rounds of Swiss on Friday and Saturday, with three rounds of *Ravnica Allegiance* Booster Draft followed by five rounds of Standard Constructed each of those days. After sixteen rounds, the event will cut to the Top 8 players, who will return Sunday to compete in single-elimination Standard Constructed using the same decks as they registered for Friday and Saturday.
