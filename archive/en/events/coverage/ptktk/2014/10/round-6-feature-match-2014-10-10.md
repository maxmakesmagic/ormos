2014–15 Pro Club Platinum Pro–level, three-Grand-Prix-winning, and all-around good bloke Shahar Shenhar sat down first and shuffled up his Jeskai Aggro deck. Practicing in the Team ChannelFireball beach house all week, eating meals prepared by Luis Scott-Vargas, Shenhar settled on a version of Jeskai Aggro. He said that even though it's one of the few known entities going into the tournament, tuning it for the mirror can change the entire match-up. So the team put minor tweaks in here and there, and Shenhar chose to run with one of the most consistent-appearing decks.



 "It beats green-based decks," he said, "it beats the red decks," and he continued that it could be tuned well to beat the [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) combo deck that the team expected to see. He also had a plan for at least a version of the Mardu Planeswalkers deck his opponent is running.




 So all those superlative descriptions and nomenclature for Shenhar are great and all, but, his opponent, Jérémy Dezani needs only one—Number One. Right now, Jérémy Dezani is the top-ranked player in the world. It was at this new-format Pro Tour last year where Jérémy Dezani became a household name, and came like a screaming [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) across the sky to announce his rise into the top levels of *Magic*. He has yet to slow and has come with a creature-light, nary -absent, Mardu Planewalker deck that keeps the board clear while gaining incremental advantage with cards like Chandra Pyromaster, [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker), and even an Elspeth, Sun's Champion.





*The two titanic Platinum-pro players, Jérémy Dezani and Shahar Shenhar, go head-to-head in Round 6.*
