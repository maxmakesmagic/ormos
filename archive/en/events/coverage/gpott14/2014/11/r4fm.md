Even in this modern era of super-sized Grand Prix, there's no guarantee of an easy road to start the day. Take this match. On one side, hometown hero and 2008 Canadian National Champion Dan Lanthier, an odds-on favorite to do his country proud at this event. On the other, 14th Ranked Player Sam Black, for whom this event is just one stop on a road that ends at the World Championships in December.



**The Games**




 The match started inauspiciously for Lanthier, who went down to five cards and missed his second land drop. He found land soon after, but his development was stunted. Black, meanwhile, played out a small army off just plains, two morphs and a 4/3 [Abzan Battle Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Battle+Priest). It looked like he would run away with the game.




 A fourth land for Lanthier let him summon the mighty [High Sentinels of Arashin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Sentinels+of+Arashin) to go with his unexciting [Gurmag Swiftwing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Swiftwing). He had to take still more damage rather than risk it in combat when Black swung in with his Priest and a very suspicious morph. Lanthier untapped and prepared to meet Black's attack with mana untapped. Black sent the same two creatures. Lanthier pushed his High [Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinel)s in front of the morph. Black flipped up [Ruthless Ripper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruthless+Ripper), revealing [Bitter Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Revelation). Lanthier took it down with a [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut). Still, he was low in the single digits.
