*What's the funniest way you've heard of someone getting into **Magic**?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_miketurian.jpg)**Mike Turian:** I asked most people I played against at the *Rise of the Eldrazi* Prerelease how they started playing **Magic**. The thing that struck me was how I never got the same answer twice.

The coolest story I came across was from someone who told me that he had only been playing for a few months. He was in middle school when he started playing. He discovered **Magic** after his mom dropped him off at the convention center for an event. She had given him $20 dollars to enter the event. Unfortunately for him, that event wasn't going on that day. Fortunately for him, a **Magic** event was. The player quickly realized that if he went back to his mom without having played he would have to give back the $20 dollars, so instead he joined the **Magic** tournament and learned how to play **Magic**.
