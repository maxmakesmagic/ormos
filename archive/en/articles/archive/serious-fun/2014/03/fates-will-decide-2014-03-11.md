 Bruce's games invariably involve several friends, crazy plays, and many laughs. Bruce believes that if anyone at your table isn't having fun, then you are doing it wrong. 







Clone and its variants leave much up to the Fates. When you put a card that copies another card in your deck, you hope for something impressive. You think of the fantastic creatures you have put in your deck, and imagine copying one of them, leaving your opponents despairing over having to face multiple versions of your most powerful creatures. You may even think about copying the cards your opponents play. Matching an opponent's Kozilek with your Kozilek. Matching an opponent's [Chromanticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromanticore) with your [Chromanticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromanticore).

 But the Fates are not always kind. Those games where the only creature worth copying is a [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). Those games where your opponent's creatures are all hexproof. So much is left to the Fates. 

With this being Fated Week, I thought we'd let the Fates determine the wisdom of your decision. And what are you deciding?

 You are building a deck for tonight's game against your friends. You have decided to run a blue deck and have managed to make all your deck choices, but one. Are you running the latest "copy a creature" variant, [Fated Infatuation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Infatuation), or [Phyrexian Metamorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Metamorph)? You know there will be four or five of you playing tonight. You can see benefits for either card, and limitations for each, but you aren't the type to waffle and put in two of each. You've done that before and you never seem to get the one you want when you need it, so you are committing to one or the other. Which will it be?

 Did you choose [Fated Infatuation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Infatuation)? If this is your choice, then the Fates now take over. In this case, your fate will be determined by time. You are likely reading this on an electronic device that has a clock. Check the time on the clock:
