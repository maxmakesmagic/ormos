### *Theros* Preview Party


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1196_ino5e8iqv9_theroslogo.jpg)  
Want to attend our exclusive party? Be part of the Hero's Path Challenge at PAX. There will be three stations around PAX:


* **Heroes - The Polis** - This is the hub, start here to pick up your stamp card.
* **Monsters - The Wilds**
* **Gods - The Temple**

At each station you will have to solve the puzzle themed to the station and receive one of three stamps for your card. When you collect all three stamps, return to the Polis and turn in your card as well as a completed publicity waiver in exchange for an invitation to the party on Saturday night. Turning in your card also gives you an entry to the drawing for an oversized *Theros* preview card to take home!


For the first time, these puzzle stations will continue to run all four days of PAX! Even though the party is on Saturday you'll want to check out the stations each day as we reveal new *Theros* cards.


Party information: Saturday, August 31, 2013. 7 p.m. - 11 p.m. at the Showbox at The Market.
