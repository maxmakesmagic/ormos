 Paul Cheon took a long break from competitive *Magic*, but he's doing some serious work since his return last year. Cheon has eight Grand Prix Top 8s, a US National Championship, and a Team Worlds Championship to his name.



His opponent, Sam Pardee, has been demolishing North American Grand Prix events for the last few years. This is Pardee's fourth Grand Prix Top 8, and he shows no sign of slowing down.



 Pardee put a lot of pressure on Cheon early in the first game, but Cheon was able to stabilize the board with a timely [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). The two began trading hits and it looked like Cheon might win the race. Pardee wanted to set up a lethal [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) and Cheon knew something smelled fishy. To play around the burn spell, Cheon cast [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) and used it to give his [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) [Lifelink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifelink). Pardee went deep into the tank and needed to find a route to victory on Cheon's endstep. Eventually, he decided to cast [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) to bring Cheon into burn range along with his next attack. Pardee found [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) on the top of his deck and they were on to a second game.
