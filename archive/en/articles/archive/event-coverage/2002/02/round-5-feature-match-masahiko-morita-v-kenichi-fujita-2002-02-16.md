Veteran Mage Kenichi Fujita is no stranger to the Feature Match Area, and after a second-place performance at Grand Prix - Shizuoka, neither is Masahiko Morita. After relaxing for three rounds and winning their fourth, both were on track for Day 2.

Morita checked his opening hand one card at a time and found it acceptable. Having won the right to go first, he kicked off, starting with a turn-three [Cabal Torturer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Torturer). A [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) from Fujita dispatched it. However, Morita had drawn into an island, enabling a [Puppeteer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppeteer). He had a Firebolt of his own to dispatch Fujita's [Barbarian Lunatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Lunatic) before it could mess with his plans.

Fujita thought hard before deciding to play [Krosan Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Avenger). Morita played the waiting game behind his [Puppeteer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppeteer). [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) rescued the Lunatic. Morita reused his [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) to kill the Avenger. With the [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) gumming up his operation, Fujita threw his [Chatter of the Squirrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chatter+of+the+Squirrel) tokens at it, then finished it off with the Lunatic, tapping out.

Morita continued to play coy, waiting for Fujita to flashback his [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) on the [Puppeteer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppeteer) before acting. This time it was a [Cephalid Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter), and it went to work. Fujita tried to get his gang pants on, sacrificing a land to bring out [Stone-Tongue Basilisk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone-Tongue+Basilisk), but Morita was ready with a [Waste Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waste+Away) pitching [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis).

But Fujita was not going down without a fight. He laid out [Anurid Scavenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Scavenger) and put [Seton's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Desire) on his [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger). Fortune was with Morita, as his Looter turned up his second mountain, and put him at threshold. That meant that his [Shower of Coals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shower+of+Coals) could destroy Fujita's board.

But it wasn't over! Fujita tried the [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger), only to see it fall to [Morbid Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger). He brought it back with [Morgue Theft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morgue+Theft), and this time Morita couldn't handle it. Morita stripped a [Nantuko Cultivator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Cultivator) from his hand with a [Mesmeric Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) and brought out Laquatus. Fujita had [Fiery Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper) at the ready to dispatch him, and his 'Flinger ate the Looter.

By this time Morita had hit nine mana, and reused his Hunger to stop the 'Flinger. Fujita's [Nantuko Calmer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Calmer) spelt trouble. Morita shored up his defenses with a [Cephalid Sage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Sage) and [Grotesque Hybrid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grotesque+Hybrid). Fujita took a moment to bring back his by now very tired [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger).

Taking this as a sign of weakness, Morita went all out, casting [Patchwork Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patchwork+Gnomes) and [Organ Grinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Organ+Grinder). Fujita turned the tables with a monstrous [Sickening Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Dreams) for three. Morita was lucky to be able to pitch [Fiery Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper) to regenerate his Gnomes and finish off the Calmer.

Now Morita was hanging on my the skin of his teeth. Fujita had a 3/3 Cultivator and a [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) at threshold. He tried to race in the air with [Soul Scourge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Scourge) and [Aven Fisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fisher), but he wasn't at enough life. When he drew two successive land, it looked like it was over. His last hope was a [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) that brought up [Ambassador Laquatus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambassador+Laquatus). [Afflict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict) helped the [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) take it down, and they were on to game
two.

Morita started game two strong with Looter followed by [Puppeteer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppeteer). He had no answer for [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger), and dug furiously through his deck. His last loot turned up a very lucky [Fiery Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper) that went with his single mountain. [Clockwork Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Gnomes) showed up to help out.

Fujita tried a [Krosan Constrictor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Constrictor). Morita attacked with just the Gnomes, then tapped the Constrictor and attacked with the team. Fujita, having made no other plays, conceded to save time for game three.

Morita was slow out of the gates in the deciding game. Fujita let with [Krosan Restorer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Restorer), [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger), and a [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) for Morita's [Aven Fisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fisher). [Grotesque Hybrid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grotesque+Hybrid) fell to [Flame Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Burst) and [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger). But he couldn't stop Morita's [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and [Dreamwinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder).

Morita continued to press Fujita's resources, forcing the [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) with [Zombie Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Assassin). [Morbid Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger) took out [Krosan Constrictor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Constrictor) before it could become a problem. But then Fujita drew [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd), churning out some very big guns. [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise) took out the [Dreamwinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder) to clear a path.

[Restless Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restless+Dreams) got Morita back some valuable blockers, including the Hybrid that now held off two Elephants. Fujita made a [Twigwalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twigwalker) and waited. When Morita tapped out again the following turn, he used [Sickening Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Dreams) to wreck his board, and [Twigwalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twigwalker) to save his Elephants. Game and match to Fujita.
