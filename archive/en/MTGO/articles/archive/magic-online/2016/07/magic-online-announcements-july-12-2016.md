**The Year of Modern Flashbacks Adds *Alara Reborn***


It's 2016: the Year of Modern Flashbacks! If you want to build up a collection for Modern, these Flashback Drafts add everything you draft to your collection once the event is over. Even if Modern isn't your thing, you can enjoy a leisurely draft through the planes of the past with rotating formats each week!


Full Alara Block Flashback Drafts begin Wednesday, July 13, 10:00 a.m. PT/5:00 p.m. UTC, and are followed up with a triple *Magic 2010* Flashback Draft. You can join the full Alara Block Flashbacks with the full Alara Block combined boosters (three foil or regular) released on *Magic Online* during that time, as well as one booster each of each set. All three booster options require an additional 2 Event Tickets to join. The options to join with 10 Event Tickets or 100 Play Points will be available as well. No matter what you join with, the actual draft will consist of a *Shards of Alara* booster, a *Conflux* booster, and an *Alara Reborn* booster.


The [full Flashback Draft schedule](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/year-of-modern-flashbacks-2015-12-14) has been updated with formats throughout the rest of the year, so mark your calendar for the formats you're most excited about!


**Please Note:**  After Triple *Magic 2010* Flashback Drafts, we'll be taking a break for *Eldritch Moon* from July 27 to August 17.

**Reminder: No Downtime on July 13**


In an effort to make sure *Magic Online* is available when you want to play *Magic*, we’re working on ways to reduce the number of times we have to bring the system offline for maintenance. As a first step we’re simply going to eliminate at least one downtime each month.


Here are the dates of the exact downtimes we’ll be skipping through August of 2016:


* July 13
* August 3

**Please Note:** While there is no downtime tomorrow, a client only update will be delivered to address an issue that could cause trades to get out of sync. The update should be complete before noon and will be automatically applied the first time players launch the client after it is delivered.
