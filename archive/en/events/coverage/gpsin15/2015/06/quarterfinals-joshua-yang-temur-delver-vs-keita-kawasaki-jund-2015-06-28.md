 Joshua Yang is one of most active players of the Singaporean community. As a matter of fact, he is such a dedicated player that he is 5th on Lifetime Planeswalker points in all of Asia Pacific. Aside from a Nationals Team appearance back in 2011, he has also a couple of 9th place finishes at previous Grand Prix. Today, he has finally broke through to the Top 8, but he finds himself facing his most dreaded matchup.



Keita Kawasaki's Jund deck was laden with removal. [Terminate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate). [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay). [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil). All the nasty cards that are great against Temur Delver!


Game One
========



 Yang sculpted his hand with a pair of [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) before dropping a pair of [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets). Kawasaki tried to kill it with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), but Yang countered it with [Disrupting Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupting+Shoal) (exiling [Thought Scour](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Scour)) for the tempo play.

However, that did not amount to any advantage, because Kawasaki was able to stabilize with [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay), before adding beatsticks [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) to the board.


Yang was out of gas prety quick. Within two turns, Yang was forced with chump with [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) and [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). He knew the writing was on the wall.



**Joshua Yang 0 – Keita Kawasaki 1**



Game Two
========


Kawasaki forced Yang to lose [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) using [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), but quickly faced pressure from [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). [Thought Scour](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Scour) grew it into a 5/6, thanks to it milling [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) in the process.

This meant that Kawasaki's [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) was not good enough to keep [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) at bay, so he added [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) to hold the fort and munch away at Yang's graveyard.


Kawasaki did have [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) to kill Yang's [Huntmaster of the Fells](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells) before it could transform, before adding a pair [Huntmaster of the Fells](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells) of his own.


Yang tried to stabilize with [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Hooting Mandrills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hooting+Mandrills) but the advantage from the pack of wolves and werewolves, backed up with spot removal, was too overwhelming.

Yang: What a terrible match up, I just don't think I beat that attrition.



**Joshua Yang 0 – Keita Kawasaki 2**
