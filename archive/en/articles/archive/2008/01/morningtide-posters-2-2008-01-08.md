Hey! How about some more *Morningtide* posters?


As you remember from [yesterday](/en/node/603031), the tribes in *Morningtide* are more class-based than race-based. And do you know what makes a neat class? Soldiers!


![Soldier](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1499_MORPoster_Soldier_6r0bs.jpg)*[Soldier Poster in PDF (1.6MB)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1499_MORPoster_Soldier_6r0bs.pdf)*
Of course, no game of **Magic** would be complete without Wizards!


![Wizard](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1499_MORPoster_Wizard_1ru2y.jpg)*[Wizard Poster in PDF (1.6MB)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1499_MORPoster_Wizard_1ru2y.pdf)*
Oh boy! The prerelease, by the way, is the weekend of January 19.
