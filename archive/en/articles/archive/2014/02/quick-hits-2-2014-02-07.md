***Roberto Gonzales (Pro Tour Gatecrash Top 16)**: Drown in Sorrow makes a lot of decks unplayable.* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/sss14/qh_verhey.jpg)***Gavin Verhey (Magic R&D Designer)** : Brimaz, King of Oreskos makes players say 'I will play white because of this card.*
