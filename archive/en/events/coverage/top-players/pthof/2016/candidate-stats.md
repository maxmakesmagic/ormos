EVENTS: HALL OF FAME
--------------------


2016 CANDIDATE STATISTICS
=========================




Take a dive into the statistics of the 2016Â *Magic*Pro Tour Hall of Fame candidates.


















2016 CANDIDATE STATS
--------------------


*Editor's Note: After the date of which this data was published, some formula errors were discovered in the POY Top 10, PTs Played, and Median columns that were leaving off some recent events. This formula has been fixed to allow for the latest Pro Tours in those numbers. In addition, Lukas Blohon's Top 8 number has been adjusted up to 1 to account for his Top 8 at Pro Tour Dark Ascension (previously it was listed as 0). Lukas Jaklovsky's Pro Tour Top 8 number has been adjusted from 2 to 1.*


*In addition, due to a data processing error involving an event that was incorrectly classified, Marijn Lybaert's PT Top 16s, PT Top 32s, PT Top 64s, # of PTs have been shifted down by 1. His median finish was shifted up from 89 to 90.*


The following is a breakdown of the candidates for induction in the 2016 *Magic* Pro Tour Hall of Fame. **All statistics are through April 24, 2016.**


Key
===


**Median Finish:** Midpoint of career Pro Tour finishes (half above, half below)  
**Three-year Median:** Top median finish taken from three consecutive seasons (to qualify, must have played in a number of events in a three-year span equal to the total number of events minus three)  
**POY Top 10s:** Number of times a player finished in the Top 10 in a Player of the Year race.  
**Top Finishes:** These are cumulative counts by result finish (for example, a Top 8 finish is also counted as a Top 16, Top 32, and Top 64).  
**WC:** Appearance/Top 4 finishes at the current version of the *Magic* World Championship (2012-current, including the Players Championship)
