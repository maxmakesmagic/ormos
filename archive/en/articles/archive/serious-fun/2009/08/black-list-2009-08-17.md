Welcome to Exiled Week! This week is all about putting things out to pasture.

In the game, to exile something is to remove it from the game, at least temporarily. I can't begin to tell you how glad I am that writing about **Magic** will never again require me to type the words "removed from the game." (Which, yes, I just did, but that was strictly voluntary.) "Exile" is a breath of fresh air. It's a specialized term that people have to learn, sure, but it's shorter, and it's a heck of a lot more honest. As a plus, it's also what [Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exile) does (and [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile)—I wonder if they did that on purpose ...).

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/sf/sf52_exiled.jpg)The *From the Vault: Exiled* boxed set, which presold at Gen Con last week and officially goes on sale next week, uses a different meaning of "exile." It's talking about banned amp; restricted lists, which literally remove cards from the game of **Magic** (at least in specific formats). For tournament play, banned lists keep things fun and fair by putting a stop to particularly degenerate strategies. If a "broken" card or combo is allowed to persist, players are forced by the basic structure of tournaments to either beat 'em or join 'em, which can result in some *really* dull **Magic**.

Nearly all tournament players accept and understand the need to ban cards, and in any case, ultimately it's not their decision. Attitudes about banned lists in casual play, by contrast, vary widely from group to group and person to person. I've been pretty fortunate in that regard; generally speaking, I either loan or borrow decks, or play with people who are already using some agreed-upon format like Elder Dragon Highlander. Recently, however, I had a less fortunate experience that got me thinking about casual banned lists.

Banned Aid
I only spent a few days at U.S. Nationals in Kansas City, but you'll notice that I keep mining it for stories. That's because there was a lot of **Magic** packed into those few days. I already [told you about](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/51) one late-night Elder Dragon Highlander game, but there was another one after that that I haven't mentioned—chiefly because, while it was quite serious, I wouldn't describe it as "fun."

It was another three-person game, with me, a judge named John (but not the same one as last week), and a local guy we'll call Brian. Let me stress that I'm not telling this story to put anybody down—just to illustrate why I've been thinking about banned lists lately.
