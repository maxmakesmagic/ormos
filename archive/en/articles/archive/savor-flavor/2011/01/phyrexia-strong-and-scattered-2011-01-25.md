If the Mirrans had known of the evil that was incubating inside their planar core, they may have had a chance to thwart it before it took even a single Mirran life. They might have been able to send teams of specialists down into the core, protected by a halo of summoned creatures and shielding spells, on the path to hunt the source of the corruption and wipe it out once and for all.

In fact, that's what Koth, Elspeth, and Venser thought they [could do](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Multiverse/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature2/124a). Koth learned of the danger to his home world of Mirrodin when the Mephidross began spreading beyond its borders, and sought other-planar help to put a stop to it. Elspeth had first-hand exposure to the evil of Phyrexia in her childhood, when it ravaged her home plane; it left wounds on her psyche that still plague her today. And Venser grew up in Urborg, a place that will be forever recovering from the scars of the Phyrexian invasion of Dominaria—and he had a personal connection to Mirrodin, in the form of his former mentor, the silver golem Karn, Mirrodin's creator. All three of these planeswalkers knew the potential danger to Mirrodin. And all three of them believed they could track the Phyrexian corruption to its source, do a little magical dueling *zap bang k'pow*, and with any luck, wipe this force off the plane once and for all.

As it turned out, it was way too late for that.

Revised Expectations
The eradication of Phyrexia is tricky. It's not just the resilient nature of the Phyrexian oil, which carries the seed of corruption within every drop. It's not just the slippery-slope "zombie math" of any enemy that recruits its victims, which can turn any terrible battlefield victory into a doubly terrible mass Corrupted Conscience. It's also, strangely enough, the element of surprise. Phyrexia always seems to startle its victims, even when it *hasn't* had the advantage of cozily nesting within the mana-rich core of Mirrodin and then popping out at a crucial time, after battling Memnarch has already taken its toll on the populace. It's as if Phyrexia's ruthlessness and hunger is too vast to fit well into innocent brains; people just never anticipate the extent of the danger. Nothing could want to wage war on entire *ecosystems*, they think. No force could want to supplant our entire way of life with their own twisted version, using our component parts as *raw materials* in their vat factories. No civilization could be founded on the fervently-held idea that perfection somehow lies in the synthesis of *necrotic tissue* and *oil-stained metal*.

It's an advantage to be continuously underestimated. And it's that advantage that has allowed Phyrexia to gain a foothold on Mirrodin, not just as a niggling infection, but as a full-fledged pandemic. Phyrexia has flown under the radar—deep, deep under the radar—and it took advantage of that quiet time to establish itself. Even when it appeared on Mirrodin's surface, in those first encounters with nim, vedalken, elves, or the odd Mirran vermin, Phyrexia exploited its mystery. Phyrexian creatures played on the Mirrans' tendency to write off their encounters as isolated attacks or ordinary Mirran phenomena.

But now the Mirrans have realized the full breadth of what they face. Certainly Koth, Elspeth, and Venser have realized that facing Phyrexia is not a job for three lone mages, planeswalkers or no. Assumptions are being revised. Expectations are being recalculated. The struggle has caused Mirrodin's heterogeneous population to fly a single banner.

Interestingly, a similar pattern holds for the Phyrexians, but in reverse. While Mirrans are unifying, the Phyrexians are *diversifying*.

Factionalized and Fractionalized
During the Phyrexian invasion of Dominaria, Urza's planeswalker allies devastated the plane of Phyrexia, leaving Phyrexia's home all but destroyed. However, that insidious colonization weapon, the Phyrexian oil, ensured that Phyrexia would endure nevertheless. All it needed was a new plane to accommodate it, a new host organism to infect, and it would rise again.

But its new would-be home has changed it. Phyrexia always adapts to its surroundings in whatever manner will allow it to thrive. In its original system, Phyrexia only had access to black mana, so it grew as a black-aligned, necromechanical force. Here on Mirrodin, Phyrexia has evolved along all five colors of mana. (You'll see Phyrexia branch into new colors at the *Mirrodin Besieged* Prerelease.) 

This new form has made Phyrexia both stronger and weaker. It has spread into five color-aligned wings, allowing it to diversify and adapt more than ever before—giving it unprecedented strength and resilience in the fight versus the Mirrans. But this change has also introduced schisms in Phyrexia's core. What was once a monolithic threat united under Yawgmoth is now five distinct subfactions. Each bloc is Phyrexian through and through, but each has organized around a slightly different philosophy. 

Each of the five Phyrexian factions is led by its Praetor. Each Praetor is a cunning Phyrexian ruler that sets its faction's agenda and embodies its principles. Each Praetor has its own policy about how best to wage war against the Mirrans. Each has its own opinions about the potential success or uselessness of the other Phyrexian factions. And each Praetor has its own agenda regarding Karn, the silver golem whose fractured mind many hope will forge a victory for Phyrexia. For his part, Karn has been vacillating between polar opposite mental states, sometimes raging against his imprisonment in the Phyrexia-controlled core, sometimes embracing his throne (as it, indeed, has embraced him) and acting as the new Father of Machines. The Praetors offer him self-serving counsel, hoping to "Wormtongue" their way into his new regime and/or exploit his frequent losses of sense. But they all agree—whether by unity, experimentation, enslavement, industry, or predation, Phyrexia will ascend as the dominant power on Mirrodin, indulging no free species.

Phyrexia's diversification is at once its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. It has reworked itself to take the greatest advantage of the world around it, and it has picked up new forms and new, brutal magics—but it has gained this at the cost of unity of purpose. The Mirrans may be overwhelmed by Phyrexia's new expressions that attack it from every angle—or the Mirrans may find a way to use the chinks in Phyrexia's newly factionalized structure to bring the whole thing tumbling down. War will tell.
