Time flies when you're enjoying yourself, isn't it? It seemed like only yesterday when (1) Jeremy Dezani lifted the Pro Tour *Theros* Champion trophy, and I am "certain" it was yesterday that (19) Shaun McLaren had claimed Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*.


With just two more Pro Tours (and 18 more Grand Prix) to go, it is difficult to believe that we are now halfway through the 2013 – 14 season in the blink of an eye. As we anticipate the release of Journey to Nyx and **Magic** Core Set 2015, seven of the game's best talents are pretty much locked by for Platinum status, including both above-mentioned Pro Tour winners, former Player of the Year (3) Owen Turtenwald, (2) Reid Duke, master deckbuilder (5) Sam Black, up-and-coming (or rather, already there) (15) Josh McClain and Hall of Famer (4) Ben Stark.


In addition, (10) Alexander Hayne, (6) Shahar Shenhar, (13) Jacob Wilson, (25) Kentaro Yamamoto and (25) William Jensen might as well be considered to be locked as well, seeing how they are at a comfortable range of 36 to 38 Pro Points.


But what about the players in Asia Pacific? Let just take a quick peek at some of the top Asia Pacific countries ranked in order of their respective Point Leaders.

*1st Place: Hong Kong – (17) Lee Shi Tian*

After a stellar finish at Pro Tour Journey to Nyx, "Modern Master" (17) Lee Shi Tian (30 Pro Points) finds himself locked up for Gold and would only need a slight push to hit Platinum the next season. Barring any major upsets, he seems to have secured a slot to become the National Champion of Hong Kong once again and has a decently comfortable lead to clinch one of the two spots for the Player Championships at the end of the season.



**2nd Place: New Zealand - Zheng Jingwei**


Zheng Jingwei (24 Pro Points) received the bulk of his points from a Top 16 finish at Pro Tour *Theros* and a Top 8 at Grand Prix Melbourne on consecutive weeks and is on track to repeat the feat of New Zealand National Champion once again.

*3rd Place: Malaysia - Raymond Tan*

Raymond Tan (20 Pro Points) surprised all of Asia when he came out of nowhere to take down Kitakyushu, making him one of the few foreign players to have won a Japanese Grand Prix. He may not have done awesome stuff like drinking a full tankard of beer from his trophy as Brian Kibler did when he won Grand Prix Sendai, but he has performed solidly at the regional Grand Prix Circuit and as well as his Pro Tour debut at Pro Tour *Theros*. Aside from shooting for Malaysian National Champion, he is also in the running for Rookie of the Year, a glory that you only have one shot at.



**4th Place: Australia - Justin Cheung** 


This veteran superstar and four-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor from Down Under has been silently racking up decent finishes, including 50th place at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*. Justin Cheung (18 Pro Points) is a widely respected player around the continent and despite not being qualified for Pro Tour Journey to Nyx, we can expect to see him do great things in the next quarter, or die trying. Justin Robb (11 Pro Points), Patty Robertson (9 Pro Points) and Daniel Unwin (9 Pro Points) are also giving chase and it could be anyone's game.

*5th Place: Singapore - Kelvin Chew*

Ever since his Top 8 appearance at Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica*, Kelvin Chew (16 Pro Points) has become a mainstay in the regional Grand Prix circuit and consistently cashes whenever he competes, even if he did have to endure a heartbreaking 76th place finish at Pro Tour *Theros*. Hoping for an upset are five-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor Nicholas Wong (9 Pro Points), Grand Prix Beijing Semifinalist Wong Wei Quan (9 Pro Points), Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur Champion Fabien Li (8 Pro Points) and Grand Prix Singapore Finalist Chapman Sim (8 Pro Points).

*6th Place: South Korea - Park Jun Young*

Two-time Grand Prix competitor Park Jun Young (15 Pro Points) finds himself in a neck-in-neck race with fellow countryman Nam Sung-Wook (14 Pro Points). Even though Park did break into the Top 8 of Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur, Nam closed up the gap considerably by winning Grand Prix Melbourne, while also becoming the first South Korean player to win a Grand Prix. As we speak, Nam is still undefeated with 10 wins and it won't be surprising to see him revisit the Top 8 stage again.

*7th Place: Taiwan - Kuo Tzu-Ching*

After winning the **Magic** World Cup in 2012 and putting up a Top 8 performance at Grand Prix Kitakyushu last winter, Kuo Tzu-Ching (13 Pro Points) has had a rather silent quarter. His lukewarm performances have allowed fellow teammate, Huang Hao-Shan (12 Pro Points) to gain some ground at Grand Prix Melbourne where he made his fourth Top 8 Grand Prix appearance. Close friends of both, Yu Chung Hwang (8 Pro Points) and Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur finalist Ryan Young (8 Pro Points) also in contention.



A bunch of Pro Points will be handed out today and the situation within Asia is likely to change. But even if it doesn't, there is still half a season more to go!
