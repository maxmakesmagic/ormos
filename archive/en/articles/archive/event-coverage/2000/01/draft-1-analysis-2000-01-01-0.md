The 8 top seeded players featured many familiar faces as well as a few locals. The following 8 players passing downward:


![puppeteer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=puppeteer)Brian Davis  

Yannick Roussel  

Dusting Stern  

Gary Krakower  

Timothy McKenna  

Walter Egli  

Michael Turian  

David Rood

In the first pack Turian first picked a [Puppeteer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppeteer) in a weak pack. David chose a [Rabid Elephant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rabid+Elephant) forcing green and putting Brian into Black. The rest of the pack was people talking mediocre cards to force colors. In the second pack David opened [Flame Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Burst) with Davis taking [Second Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts) over a [Childhood Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Childhood+Horror) which went to Dustin. Davis opened a [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot) in another weak pack with people settling into colors with the only pick of note being Walter's poor pick of [Pulsating Illusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulsating+Illusion) over [Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate). The rest of the first 8 packs went by with everyone staying in colors and not fighting much. After pack one the deck highlights were:


**Brian Davis:** [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot), 2 [Second Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts), [Aven Flock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock)  
**Yannick Roussel:** 2 [Blazing Salvo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Salvo) and some filler creatures  
**Dusting Stern:** [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire), [Kirtar's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kirtar%27s+Desire), [Sandstone Deadfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandstone+Deadfall)  
**Gary Krakower:** 1 [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)  
**Timothy McKenna:** 2 [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), [Demoralize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demoralize), [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest), [Dwarven Strike Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Strike+Force)  
**Walter Egli:** [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer), [Cephalid Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter)  
**Michael Turian:** [Puppeteer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppeteer)

![chainflinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=chainflinger)The second set of 8 packs again went by with people simply taking cards in their colors when they came around. McKenna picked up 2 [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) back to back and they packs were far from amazing. A [Roar of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) went to Yannick. Walter defensive drafted a [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) over a [Ashen Firebeast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen+Firebeast) which seems very questionable. 

**Brian Davis:** [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot), 2 [Second Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts), [Aven Flock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock)  
**Yannick Roussel:** 2 [Blazing Salvo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Salvo), [Roar of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm), [Flame Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Burst)  
**Dusting Stern:** [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire), [Kirtar's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kirtar%27s+Desire), [Sandstone Deadfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandstone+Deadfall), [Nomad Decoy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomad+Decoy)  
**Gary Krakower:** 1 [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst), [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger)  
**Timothy McKenna:** 2 [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun), [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest), 3 [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger), [Ashen Firebeast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen+Firebeast)  
**Walter Egli:** [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer), [Cephalid Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter)  
**Michael Turian:** [Puppeteer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppeteer)  
**David Rood:** 3 [Barbarian Lunatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Lunatic), [Flame Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Burst), [Gorilla Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorilla+Titan), [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest)


![hallowed healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=hallowed+healer)The last set of packs continued much like the second one. Krakower picked up three more [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)s bringing his total to 4. By the end Mckenna picked up many more solid RG cards. Brian Davis had 4 [Second Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts) and Walter had 4 [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer). Krakower and Turian both had poor UB decks that wouldn't have been that impressive if they pooled their cards together. David Rood and Yannick Roussel both had solid RG decks with Yannick's sporting a [Shower of Coals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shower+of+Coals) he got very late in the draft. Dustin Stern had a GW deck that he is comfortable drafted. Brian Davis has a very defensive BW deck. 

**Brian Davis:** [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot), 2 [Second Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts), [Aven Flock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock)
