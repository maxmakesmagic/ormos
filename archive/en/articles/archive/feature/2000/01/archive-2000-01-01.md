[Team Round 1: France vs. Canada](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/team-round-1-france-vs-canada-2000-01-01)    Then the trash talk began. Fuller mana burnt to 3, and then (while tapped out) dropped an Avatar of Hope without paying the two white mana. An argument issued and Fuller got a notice.

[First Deckbuilding: Team Netherlands](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/team-sealed-deck-netherlands-first-deckbuild-2000-01-01)    The rebel engine was the best I've ever seen in a Team sealed or even a constructed event practically. They had a Lin Sivvi, Lieutenant, double Falcon, Commander, double Nightwind Glider, double Lightbringer, double Fresh Volunteers, Reveille Squad and a few others. Drum roll please as they top the whole chain off with everyone's favorite black Lin Sivvi... you guessed it, REBEL INFORMER.

Fear chose that moment to Ritual out a Forced March for 2, eliminating both of Nicolas' creatures. Fear was left with no creatures or removal in hand though, as Labarre played two more Bouncers and a Drake.

Mowshowitz said after he lost game 1. "I'm 0-4 in the first game and 6-0 in the sideboarded games."

Before the match started Darwin offered a 'No sideboard' pact, but Humpherys refused. Darwin took this to mean that Dave thought he'd sideboard better, and proceeded to trash talk him for a while.

All four matches pitted a Pro Tour champion against another Pro Tour champion. Furthermore, all 8 players were still in Top 8 contention with just 4 rounds to go. (Of the 15 PT champs in attendance, 11 remained mathematically alive as round 15 started).

"What have you done to my deck?" he joked as he mulliganed down to 5. The hand seemed reasonable enough, allowing him land drops for the first three turns and offense in the form of an Airship.

Each won a Pro Tour this year and each can win the Player of the Year crown by making the Top 8 and then doing well on Sunday.

[Round 12: Kyle Rose vs. Mike Long](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/round-12-kyle-rose-vs-mike-long-br-vs-uw-2000-01-01)    These two Pro Tour Winners with 7 top 8 Pro Tour performances between them who test together and who both live in Virginia were matched in this final round of the draft portion of Worlds. One would advance with a possibility of winning only half his matches tomorrow to make the final 8 and one might have to scratch and scramble to get there.

Gallitz went nuts mocking the shockingly bad card before casting his own Trickster Mage, much to the amusement of the spectators.

A bit confused, spectators looked at the board. Tom looked at the board. Finkel was smiling like he was coming back from hell with an ice cream. Tom scratched his head. . . played the Wishmonger . . . looked again . . . did some math . . .

[Second Draft: Bob Maher, Jr.](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/draft-2-bob-maher-2000-01-01)    He got a fair pick in Diving Griffin first out of Prophecy followed by a Troubled Healer which got a smile out of our recent Chicago Pro Tour Winner.

Round 9: Tom Guevin vs. Yann Hamon   Yann Hamon is the current French national champ and a top 32 finisher at last year's Worlds. Guevin is a top 2 finisher at the first Pro Tour held in Los Angeles, and he hasn't accomplished a lot ever since, but he's probably got the biggest mouth on the Pro Tour, which makes him fun to watch. more...

Slemr draws the much needed mountain on the following turn and opts not to play his Grunt in favor of using Foil on a quality spell the following turn which is just what happened.

[Second Draft: Ben Ronaldson](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/draft-2-ben-ronaldson-2000-01-01)    A major contributor to the team, Ben took Trinity Green to first place at the English nationals, and is regarded by the team as the most committed and hard working member.

[Second Draft: Jakub Slemr](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/draft-2-jakub-slemr-2000-01-01)    All in all I thought Slemr could have drafted a better deck if he'd taken 5th pick Rishadan Airship instead of Alabaster Wall. However, he is an excellent player. I expect his skill and his three first picks (Power Matrix, Flowstone Armor, and Troubled Healer) to carry him to a 2-1 record.

[Round 8: Ben Ronaldson vs. William Jensen](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/round-8-ben-ronaldson-vs-william-jensen-gw-vs-ub-2000-01-01)    Despite the fact that he was unable to make a land drop on turns 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8, Jensen took the mana screw very stoically, not once whining about his luck. To be able to get screwed at this level of competition, and not complain shows great restraint, and deserves respect.

After recovering his composure, Humpherys knew he had to be very aggressive and try to win before Mori's card advantage was insurmountable.

Benafel, on the other hand, had picked black and white with a Notorious Assassin as one of the top cards.
