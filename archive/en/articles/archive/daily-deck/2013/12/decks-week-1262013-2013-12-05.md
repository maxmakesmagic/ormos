============================



 Posted in **Daily Deck**
 on December 6, 2013 










The office was closed last Friday so we didn't get to share in the excitement here at Decks of the Week of Owen Turtenwald winning [his second GP in a row](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpabq13/welcome)! Congratulations, Owen! Although Owen tried for a three-peat last weekend in Toronto, Ari Lax had other plans, and drafted his way to victory in Canada's [largest-ever Grand Prix](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gptor13/welcome). At the same time, across the Atlantic, Polish player Marcin Staciwa piloted Mono-Blue Devotion to victory at [Grand Prix Vienna](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpvie13/welcome). Congratulations Ari and Marcin for your victories! The Grand Prix in Toronto and Vienna mark the end of the Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* qualifier season, but worry not! PTQs start up for Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* this weekend, so find one near you with [this handy link](https://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/qualifierlist#jou)! Good luck; have fun!
