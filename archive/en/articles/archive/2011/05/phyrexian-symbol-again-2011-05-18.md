The Phyrexian symbol has been around for a long time, as established in Arcanas in [2004](/en/articles/archive/symbol-phyrexia-2004-02-16), [2005](/en/articles/archive/yawgmoths-demon-2005-07-26), and [2009](/en/articles/archive/symbol-phyrexia-2009-10-27). In the distant past, it tended to show up as a background element in card art, like the *Seventh Edition* version of [Yawgmoth's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Edict):

Because we now have a set actually called *New Phyrexia*, this seems like a logical time to revisit this. But the Phyrexian symbol is a bit more front-and-center than it used to be, and there's not much Arcana value in showing [Blind Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Zealot) and pointing out the Phyrexian symbol:

See, it's not as much fun to point out things that are in the foreground of the art. It's like saying "Did you know that there's a goblin in the art of [Bloodcrazed Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodcrazed+Goblin)?" If everyone just says, "Yeah, I did. It's right there," then the Arcana hasn't done its job.


Luckily, *New Phyrexia* has a couple of cards that have some Phyrexian symbols you might not have noticed, thus justifying this Arcana's existence. For example, you might not have noticed the fence in [Norn's Annex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norn%27s+Annex):

See? The fence is made up of a lot of Phyrexian symbols!


...Okay, some of you aren't impressed. "We saw that right away," you say. Try this on for size:

That, of course, is [Kiln Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Walker). Oh, what's that? You don't see the hidden Phyrexian symbol? You've come crawling back in apology? Okay, then. To see the symbol, go ahead and click the picture. There you go!
