With 9 rounds of Sealed Deck play in store for players today at GP Beijing, I asked pros what they thought the best uncommon in *Shadows over Innistrad* sealed deck was.

**No. 19 Yuuya Watanabe:** I think [Duskwatch Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskwatch+Recruiter) is the strongest. It's pretty unbeatable.

**Four-time GP Top 8 competitor Chapman Sim:** Man, I really want to say [Magnifying Glass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magnifying+Glass), is there something that is better? I suppose [Duskwatch Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskwatch+Recruiter) is better, but I really like [Magnifying Glass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magnifying+Glass).

**Grand Prix Taipei Champion Huang Hao-Shan:** I think I'm going to have to go with [Bound by Moonsilver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bound+by+Moonsilver).
