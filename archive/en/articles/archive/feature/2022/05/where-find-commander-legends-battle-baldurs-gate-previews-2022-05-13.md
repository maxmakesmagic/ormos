It's time for [*Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/commander-legends-battle-baldurs-gate) previews! To help our readers and preview seekers, we've created this handy guide to preview season.


May 17 at 9 a.m. PT is when everything begins. Be sure to tune in to [the official *Magic: The Gathering* YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ZGymAvfP97qJabgqUkz4A) or [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) to get your first deep dive into the cards, mechanics, and big reveals of *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* ahead of the global release June 10!



 Your browser does not support the video tag.


Then we'll show you even more to come right here on DailyMTG—and beyond—with new cards being shared across the *Magic* world.


This page will help you follow along with everything coming by giving you the outlets where upcoming *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* previews are planned on each day. The goal is to help you find what you're looking for every day and avoid engaging in previews if you so choose.


Below, you'll find a list of dates as well as any outlets previewing a card on that date. Once the previews are live, we'll update this article so that you can easily find them. If the link simply goes to the front of a website or social media site, that means they probably haven't previewed the card yet.


And if you just want to see all the cards that have been officially previewed in one place, you can always check out our [Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/commander-legends-battle-for-baldurs-gate) and our [Variant Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/commander-legends-battle-for-baldurs-gate-variants). Note that these galleries are updated every morning, Monday through Friday, so they contain all cards previewed the previous day (and earlier), but not the day of.


For the most up-to-date listings, bookmark this page and check back regularly for all the latest previews from *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate*—but we have one more invitation for you!
