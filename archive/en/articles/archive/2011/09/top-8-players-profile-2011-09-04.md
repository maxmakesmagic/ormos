**Age:** 23

**Age:** 29  
  
**Hometown:** Madison, WI  
  
**Occupation:** Writer for StarCity Games  
  
**How did you qualify for Pro Tour Philadelphia?** Pro Level 6  
  
**Number of Grand Prix / Pro Tour Top 8s:**  

PT: 0 GP: 3  
  
**Other previous ***Magic*** accomplishments:** Team World Champion, Win-a-Car Tournament winner at Worlds 2007  
  
**What was your record by format?**  

Modern: 7-2-1 Booster Draft: 5-1  
  
**How did you prepare for Pro Tour Philadelphia? Who did you prepare with?**  

Drafting *M12* in Madison all the time. *Magic* Online with John Stolzmann. In person with Zvi Mowshowitz, Gaudenis Vidugiris, Jon Finkel, Tom Martell, and Zaiem Beg.  
  
**How many hours do you spend on ***Magic*** Online in an average week?**  

Highly variable depending on whether a set has come out physically or online more recently. I probably play *Magic* about 6 hours a day.  
  
**What Modern deck did you play and why?**  

Mono Blue Poison. John Stolzmann told me he had built a deck he thought might be very good. After some changes, we couldn't find anything that beat it.  
  
**What do you think of the new Modern format?**  

I don't think this is what it was supposed to look like. Too much combo. I'd ban [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost), maybe [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal), and unban [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision), maybe Blossom.  
  
**Where do you play Friday Night ***Magic***, or if you don't go to FNM anymore, where did you play?**  

Netherworld Games in Madison – the store I founded but no longer own.

**Number of Grand Prix / Pro Tour Top 8s:**  

PT: 0 GP: 0

**How did you prepare for Pro Tour Philadelphia? Who did you prepare with?**  

With my team (Team GO) composed of Calvetto Marcello, Francesco Cipollesli, Giusti Emanuele, and some romans (Portaro, Bacco, Montanari)  
  
**How many hours do you spend on ***Magic*** Online in an average week?**  

0  
  
**What Modern deck did you play and why?**  
[Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), It seemed solid and has good match up against Twelvepost (I think there were many).  
  
**Where do you play Friday Night ***Magic***, or if you don't go to FNM anymore, where did you play?**

**Age:** 25  
  
**Hometown:** Rohnert Park, CA  
  
**How did you qualify for Pro Tour Philadelphia?** Pro Club Level 7  
  
**Number of Grand Prix / Pro Tour Top 8s:**  

PT: 2 GP: 2  
  
**Other previous ***Magic*** accomplishments:** 2010 US National Champion  
  
**What was your record by format?**  

Modern: 8-1-1 Booster Draft: 4-2  
  
**How did you prepare for Pro Tour Philadelphia? Who did you prepare with?**  

I spent a week in the woods with the [Channel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel)Fireball squad.  
  
**How many hours do you spend on ***Magic*** Online in an average week?**  

Six.  
  
**What Modern deck did you play and why?**  

Zoo. Every other deck was either [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) or a "belcher" deck -- a deck that could kill on turn two or three but was nearly as likely to turn-six fizzle. Zoo was the most stable deck, and had the best sideboard. What do you think about the new Modern format? I was super excited about the change to Modern for this PT. The way the format developed for this PT (so many flimsy combo decks) has tempered that excitement some, but I think the format will look very different now that the best decks are known.  
  
**Where do you play Friday Night ***Magic***, or if you don't go to FNM anymore, where did you play?**  

At [Channel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel)Fireball's shop, Superstars!

[Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), most consistent combo deck

Terrible, banned list makes control unplayable

**Number of Grand Prix / Pro Tour Top 8s:**  

PT: 0 GP: 0  
  
**Other previous ***Magic*** accomplishments:** Top 16 GP Dallas, 35th at GP Pittsburgh last weekend.  
  
**What was your record by format?**  

Modern: 7-1-2 Booster Draft: 5-1  
  
**How did you prepare for Pro Tour Philadelphia? Who did you prepare with?**  

Travis Woo handed me a deck list.  
  
**How many hours do you spend on ***Magic*** Online in an average week?**  

Zero. What Modern deck did you play, and why? [Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breach)-Post, because I didn't know what to play. I just played what I was given.  
  
**What do you think of the new Modern format?**  

I think the die roll is too important. Also, [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) should be unbanned. Most games end on turn four or five anyways.  
  
**Where do you play Friday Night ***Magic***, or if you don't go to FNM anymore, where did you play?**  

I don't play FNM.

Modern: 7-2-1 Booster Draft: 5-1

After the change of the format, I didn't test at all. I just talked about the format with Italian players at the Pro Tour.  
  
**How many hours do you spend on ***Magic*** Online in an average week?**  

None  
  
**What Modern deck did you play and why?**  

I played [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) because I thought it seemed solid, and I had to play combo for the bad testing  
  
**What do you think of the new Modern format?**  

I like it
