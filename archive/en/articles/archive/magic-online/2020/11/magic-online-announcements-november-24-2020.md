New *Core Set Cube* Nov 24–Dec 2
--------------------------------


The next event in the Spotlight Cube Series is almost upon us! A full week of *Core Set Cube* starts today, November 24, after our return from downtime. The cube features iconic cards from every core set on *Magic Online*, from *Seventh Edition* to *Core Set 2021* (including *Magic Origins*). Cube designer Kyle O'Neill has more on this update of *Core Set Cube* in his article, as well as a full card list, available [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/spotlight-cube-series-new-core-set-cube-2020-11-20)!

Updated Alternative Play Schedule
---------------------------------


The alternative play schedule that was announced in the *Zendikar Rising* set article has changed! Check out the latest schedule below.


* November 24–December 2: This week, a popular cube from the Spotlight Cube Series returns: Kyle O'Neill's ***Core Set Cube***, now updated through *Core Set 2021*! (Not to be confused with the kor set *Zendikar Rising*, which will still have full events running.)
* December 2–9: **Chaos Draft: *Masters* Sets**. For just this week, our Chaos Drafts are going to take only the top sets! Every set in this draft will be a *Masters* set, and it'll be glorious.
* December 9–16: **Supreme Draft: CHAOS!** Combining the fun of Supreme Draft with Chaos Draft, you'll draft a deck from 18 different packs. Which packs? Who knows? Enjoy the chaos!
* December 16–23: **Supreme Draft: *Vintage Cube***. What happens when you combine one of the most powerful formats ever with the most powerful Draft style? Yep. A week of that.
* December 23–January 13: ***Vintage Cube***. Another update in, this time with *Commander Legends* cards in the mix. This is easily the most common request we get, so . . . we hear you. More *Vintage Cube*. This will last for a few weeks, until . . .
* January 13–20: **A brand-new addition to the Spotlight Cube Series**. As usual, more details will come later, but this one promises to be a wheel of a good time.
* January 20–28: ***Vintage Masters* Flashback**. One of the most popular Draft formats of all time is back to round out *Zendikar Rising* season. We'll have a little more than a week of that, and then . . . well, it's not quite time to talk about *Kaldheim* just yet.
