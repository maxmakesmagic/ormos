With nearly every *Magic* card ever printed legal, Legacy is the format where you can play almost anything. It is no surprise, therefore, that so many decks are well represented in day 2 at Grand Prix Kyōto. The top 5 archetypes comprise over half the field.


Delver Decks (57)
=================


* Temur Delver - 16
* Grixis Delver - 14
* Sultai Delver - 14
* U/R Delver - 10
* Esper Delver - 3

Despite [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) recently getting banned, [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) is still a super powerful card. It seems that you can basically pair the one-drop with any color and have a winning deck. Between the different versions the core stays consistent: all of them run [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) and [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). The most popular variant that made day 2 were Temur Delver decks. With Green and Red, players get access to burn spells such as [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), along with powerful creatures such as [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose).


Omnitell - 39
=============


The second most popular type of deck was OmniTell Combo decks. All of them play the core combo: [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) into [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience), giving them the ability to cast cards like [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) for free. Some players opted to go with versions with [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack) and [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand)--a deck that was once dubbed "Sneak and Show"--while some players wanted access to another card like [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) and played [Dream Halls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Halls). Regardless of the details, one thing is clear: let [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) resolve and the game will be over in a few turns.


Miracles - 18
=============


With tempo Delver decks and combo decks well represented in Legacy, it is no surprise that a pure control deck is very popular here in Kyōto. Miracles, the control deck based around [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) that includes the [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance)-[Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) combo, has been seen ripping through both OmniTell and Delver opponents all weekend. It has been a good choice for 18 brave souls so far--we'll see if it continues to be one.


Elves - 16
==========


The second most popular combo deck in Kyōto is Elves Combo. Reminiscent of the deck the Luis Scott-Vargas used to win Pro Tour Berlin, this deck hopes to play a ton of elves using [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid), [Nettle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel), and [Glimpse of Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+of+Nature). With a critical mass of elves in play, a [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order) gives access to [Craterhoof Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craterhoof+Behemoth), ending the game shortly thereafter.


Stoneforge Mystic Decks (15)
============================


* Jeskai Stoneforge - 3
* Esper Stoneblade - 12

It turns out that [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) is a super powerful card. Being able to fetch a [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) or [Sword of Fire and Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice) out of your deck on turn two and get it into play on turn three is something that is powerful enough to play in Legacy. Back those cards up with the normal White-Blue control suite and you have a deck that placed 15 players into day 2. Most players opted to play the Esper version of deck which gave them access to [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls)


Just underneath these 5 archetypes are many other decks. Being a format known for it's diversity, it's no surprise that so many different decks had enough success on day 1 to propel many players to day 2:


* Merfolk - 9
* Ad Nauseam Storm - 7
* Death and Taxes - 7
* Dredge - 6
* Mono-Brown - 5
* Affinity - 5
* Reanimator - 5
* Other - 33
