Flying is the most convenient mode of transportation for most visitors traveling to Thailand. Domestic flights are also easy and convenient, cutting down on journey time. 


A number of domestic carriers service a majority of large provincial cities dotting generously across the country. Travel to neighboring countries is cheaper when booked within Thailand. Train services connect Bangkok to all regions of the country at reasonable prices. A regular rail service also runs between Bangkok and Singapore via Malaysia. Long distance coaches, both air-conditioned and open-aired, connect all major cities.


At the local level, diverse forms of transportation are provided: provincial buses, city buses, songthaews, tuk-tuks, rickshaws, boats, and even rental cars. 


**International Travel**   
 Air: With Bangkok serving as the international travel hub of southeast Asia, the capital serves as the landing port for numerous international airlines, most with direct flights from their destinations. Some chartered and regional flights may land at one of the other international airports within Thailand, consisting of Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Hat Yai, Phuket, and Ubon Ratchatani. The country’s national airline is Thai Airways. Airport departure taxes for international departures costs 700 baht/person. The check-in counters open 2 hours and close half an hour prior departure time. 


* [International flights information](http://www.tourismthailand.org/travel-information/travel-information-117-1.html)

(662) 535-1254 (departures) (662) 535-1301 (arrivals)  
Those traveling from neighboring countries may enter Thailand via road, rail, ships, or ferries. 


**Domestic Travel**   
 Domestic travel during public holidays and on weekends, particularly to popular destinations, should be booked well in advance for all modes of transportation. Booking is particularly difficult during the Songkran Holiday and New Year’s Holiday. 


Air: Local carriers Thai Airways(TG) and Bangkok Airways (PG) fly to most major provincial airports beyond 250 km distance from Bangkok. Thai Airways’ 2 most popular routes are Chiang Mai and Phuket. Services to Koh Samui and Sukhothai are only provided by Bangkok Airways. Other smaller local carriers include Angel Air (mainly servicing Phuket) and PB Air which flies to fewer destinations. Air Andaman services is limited to the Southern cities only. 


Another carrier is SGA scenic airline of Thailand which flies to Hua Hin everyday, and also provides air charter service in the region. 


The domestic terminal is located at the southern end of the Bangkok International Airport. Normally, check-ins for domestic flight is one hour prior to departure time and closes half an hour before flight time. Departure tax has already been added to your ticket fare. 


Domestic flights Information:  
 (662) 535-1192 (departures)   
 (662) 535-1253 (arrivals) 


**Reservation / Ticket**   
 Bangkok Airways Tel. (662) 265-5555 , Nok Air Tel. (662) 900-9955 PB Air Tel. (662) 261-0220-5 , SGA Tel. (662) 664-6099 , Thai Airways Tel. (662) 628-2000


Tickets can be purchased through travel agencies (cheaper for international flights, same for domestic flights) or by booking with the airlines themselves, either via phone, internet, or e-ticketing kiosks (Thai Airways only). 


Buses: Inter-city bus services offer a fast means of transport to all corners of the country. Air-conditioned buses service many provincial areas and bookings for both regular and tour coaches (private companies) can be made through major hotels and travel agents, or at the following bus terminals: 


* Northern Bus Terminal : Kampaengphet 2 Rd, Bangkok Tel: 0-2936-2852-66 ext. 614   
 0-2936-3670
* Eastern Bus Terminal :   
 Sukhumvit Rd, Bangkok.   
 Tel: 0-2391-6846, 0-2391-2504
* Northeastern Bus Terminal :   
 Kampaengphet 2 Rd, Bangkok   
 Tel: 0-2936-2841-48 ext.605 , 448  
 0-2936-0657
* Southern Bus Terminal :

* Central Bus Terminal :   
 Kampaengphet 2 Rd, Bangkok   
 Tel: 0-2936-1972

The government bus company, called Bor Kor Sor (BKS), provides the cheapest mode for getting around Thailand. Being frequent and reliable, no advance booking is necessary. Both air-conditioned ones and open-aired ones stop almost everywhere along their route, with the latter being the cheapest and slowest. 


Trains: The State Railway of Thailand runs an efficient rail service linking Bangkok (Hua Lam Phong is the central train station) to the rest of the country at very reasonable prices for express, fast and ordinary trains. Limited western and southern routes out of Bangkok also operate from the Thon Buri Station, traveling to destinations as far as Kanchanaburi province in the west and Chumporn province in southern Thailand. 


On express trains, sleepers are available in three classes: first and second class (air-conditioned), and second class (non air-conditioned, but with fans). 


Advance tickets are available at all principal stations or the Bangkok Railway Advance Booking Office at Tel : 0-2220-4444
