Okay, enough fooling around. It's Wednesday already, and we haven't had any *Gatecrash* preview cards in Arcana. This will not stand! Today, we have the best kind of preview cards: alternate-art event promos!


### Prerelease Cards


When you go to [your local prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-facts), you'll have a choice of five guilds: Orzhov, Dimir, Gruul, Boros, and Simic. When you select your guild, you'll get a Guild Prerelease Pack, which will contain five *Gatecrash* booster packs, one booster pack for your specific guild, an achievement card, a Spindown Life Counter, a letter from your new guildmaster, a guild sticker, and an alternate-art foil Prerelease card. And you'll be able to play your Prerelease card in your Prerelease deck! So here's what each guild is getting.


**Orzhov: Treasury Thrull**

*Gatecrash* goes on sale on Friday, February 1, 2013. And that means [Friday Night **Magic**](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=events/magic/fnm) has a special card for everyone, while supplies last!
