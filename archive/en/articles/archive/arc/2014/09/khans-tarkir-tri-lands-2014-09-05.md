 Many people—okay, pretty much everyone—took note of the two special *Khans of Tarkir* tri-lands in [*Duel Decks: Speed vs. Cunning*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/duel-decks-speed-vs-cunning-2014-08-18), with the clan symbol watermarks, and extrapolated that we'd have one for each of the wedges. Since you're all very smart people, you were (naturally) correct. I give you...all five tri-lands from *Khans of Tarkir*.





  


  


  


  


  

 But why stop there? Each of the five lands paints a pretty portrait of Tarkir and gives you a sense of the world we're about to visit. So, as a bonus, enjoy the art from all five *Khans of Tarkir* tri-lands, supersized.
