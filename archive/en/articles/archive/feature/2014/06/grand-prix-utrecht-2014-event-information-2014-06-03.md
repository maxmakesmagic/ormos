![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/promo/batterskull.jpg)*Get your promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).*Utrecht, the 4th biggest city of The Netherlands, was once the capital of Kingdom Holland. It's currently the most booming city of the country. Utrecht is known as a student city with a large population of single young people. This results in a great nightlife with many places to dance, drink or eat.

Don't miss the Dom Tower, the highest church tower in the Netherlands, or relax in the cloister gardens next to it. Or perhaps you want to rent a canal bike and pedal your way around the canals? In the evening, you'd better go to the Oudegracht lower docks, to get a drink on one of the terraces.

Best of all, there are a large amount of stores (near the Oudegracht) that sell board games, card games, wargames, roleplaying games, fantasy and science-fiction books, etc.

Discover Utrecht at [Wikitravel](http://wikitravel.org/en/Utrecht).

* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day Two that they used on Day One.


**Tournament Structure**


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of a maximum of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 6 Swiss rounds and the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 playoff matches will have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
