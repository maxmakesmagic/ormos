Australia's Joseph Sclauzero is riding high after his victory at Grand Prix Manila earlier this year, and with no losses so far this weekend, is no doubt hoping to add another trophy to his collection. Makihito Mihara is already in the Hall of Fame, but certainly isn't above adding another trophy to his hoard.


Sclauzero mulliganed once, which isn't disastrous for his Naya [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) deck, while Mihara went back twice, which could make assembling his [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combo difficult. Both players traded early cards until Sclauzero used [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) to find a [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) and a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Mihara tried to stall Sclauzero's attackers with a [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), but the Knight fetched forth a [Kessig](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig) Wolf Run, and Sclauzero was soon trampling the Hall of Famer into the ground.


**Sclauzero 1 – Mihara 0**


Mihara began Game 2 with a [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), while Sclauzero missed his second land drop. The [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) he'd been hoping to carry him through the land shortage was soon Roast'd while the Lavamancer melted a [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl). Sclauzero found a [Horizon Canopy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Canopy) on turn 3, but his tempo was lost, and Mihara calmly traded his cards for Sclauzero's threats before eventually playing a [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) on his [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) and making many, many copies of the 1/4.

**Sclauzero 1 – Mihara 1**


Sclauzero had the perfect start in game 3, with a turn 1 [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) into a turn 2 [Loxodon Smiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter). The Smiter attacked Mihara to 15, and then 10 while Mihara made a [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite). Sclauzero added a [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) to the board, leaving three mana open, so Mihara probed for information with a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique). Sclauzero responded by sending the [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) on a [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), while Mihara let Sclauzero keep a [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) and a second Nacatl.


When the Australian attacked, Mihara summoned a [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), and surprising all onlookers, elected to push the Exarch and the Clique in front of the Smiter.


"Interesting," Sclauzero mused. "Three cards in hand?" Mihara nodded, as Sclauzero let the Exarch take all of the damage. Sclauzero played out the second Nacatl, but the [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) got Spell Snared.


"You're on 9?" Sclauzero confirmed, and attacked. Mihara threw his remaining cards at Sclauzero's team, and fell to 3 life. With Mihara tapped out, Sclauzero grinned and played a [Choke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choke).


Mihara could only smile back and say "good... card."

Mihara untapped a Mountain, [Cascade Bluffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cascade+Bluffs), and his [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground), and inhaled heavily, before finally laughing at his own misfortune. He shook his head, but drew and played an [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) for 1, wiping out the rest of Sclauzero's team.


Sclauzero rallied with another [Loxodon Smiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter), but Mihara took it out with a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) assisted [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). The Smiter was replaced by yet another [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl). The [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) held it off for one turn, but Mihara was unable to find anything else to stop the cat scratching him to death.
