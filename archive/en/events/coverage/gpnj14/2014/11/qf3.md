Tom Ross is "The Boss" of Infect. The Community Cup hero and Grand Prix Houston 2013 Top 8 contender Ross is known for playing with Legacy poison to great results: The deck helped earn him both of this two StarCityGames Invitational victories, and it had spread its illness throughout both days of Grand Prix New Jersey. In fact, it was so contagious that it put Ross into the top seed for the Top 8.



 That's exactly where an aggressive deck like Ross's wants to be. Attacking early and often with [Glistener Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf), [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent), or [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), cards like [Invigorate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invigorate) and *Khans of Tarkir*'s become Immense could turn any of Ross's small fries into an instantly deadly dose.




 Lam Phan earned his first Grand Prix Top 8 almost a decade ago at Grand Prix Philadelphia in 2005. There, [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) was his weapon of choice. While it was still a legal choice here, his deck for this weekend was a Lands twist packing Standstill. Using "man lands" uch as Mishra's Factory, Phan wanted to keep the battlefield in his favor before setting up [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) to punish any opponent trying to fight their way out.




 Of course, Ross had lands of his own. The [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s Phan played beside it all would need to be ready.




**The Games**




 Ross came out swinging in game one, using [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) to protect early and force through five poison counters from [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and [Glistener Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf). However, Phan spent his countermagic and removal to stabilize from there, tearing back into Ross with Mishra's Factory.



Out of infectious creatures, Ross could only hold out so long without any reinforcements until the Factory built Phan a game win.
