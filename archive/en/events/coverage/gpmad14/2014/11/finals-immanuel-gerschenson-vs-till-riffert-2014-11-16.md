=============================================

Only two players remained in the running for the title of Grand Prix champion: Germany's Till Riffert and Immanuel Gerschenson from Austria. While it was the first Top 8 for both, now only one more match separated one of them from hoisting the trophy.


Gerschenson was playing Blue-Red Delver with green for [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), a card many players considered crucially weakened with the advent of delve cards like [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). Gerschenson still swore by it. Meanwhile, Riffert had brought [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) with [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), a strategy quite popular at this event. So, whoever won, the winning list would be a Temur deck


Game 1
======


Riffert suspended [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow) on turn one and after that had to reveal his hand: more lands and [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand). "Not the best draw," Riffert admitted.


Over the next couple of turns, Gerschenson cast a lot of spells: a couple of [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), more [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe)s, and one [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), but the only spell of real consequence was [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), which brought Riffert to 9, before it was joined by a second [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf).

Riffert just sat there, played land after land, before he finally tried [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). It resolved and Riffert commented, "I did not expect that." So did his [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), tapping Gerschenson's [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s and buying Riffert one more turn. That was exactly what he needed. He played his seventh land, cast [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) with two mana in his pool, and Gerschenson just nodded and picked up his cards

Game 2
======


Gerschenson mulliganed into four lands, [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), and thought long and hard about another mulligan. He kept, drew another land off the top and kept [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) and [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) on top. All the disruption in the world wouldn't save him, however, if he didn't deploy a threat anytime soon. And no, the [Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain) he cast next didn't count either.


Finally, on turn five, he managed to find some creatures with the help of more [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) and [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise). He summoned [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) as well as [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Suddenly, things didn't look half bad for Gerschenson. Riffert fought back with sideboarded creatures of his own, first [Obstinate Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth), then [Inferno Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan).


Baloth died when it blocked [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), [Inferno Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) was returned to Riffert's hand via [Vapor Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag), and with Riffert's life total already dangerously low, another [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) sealed the deal.


**Immanuel Gerschenson 1-1 Till Riffert**


Game 3
======


While Riffert mulliganed to five on the play, Gerschenson led with [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) and attacked with [Insectile Aberration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) on turn two. Riffert's five weren't half bad, however, and by the end of his fourth turn, he had already summoned two [Obstinate Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth)s to join the race. Soon enough he was leading 11 to 16 and Gerschenson was using [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) tokens to chump.

But Gerschenson simply wasn't running out of spells to trigger [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), largely thanks to [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise). In fact, not only was he able to chump and chump, he managed to amass an army of his own, which overwhelmed Riffert eventually. A pair of [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s and one [Vapor Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag) did the rest.



**Immanuel Gerschenson 2-1 Till Riffert**


**Congratulations to Immanuel Gerschenson, champion of Grand Prix Madrid 2014!**
