***Magic Online* Format Updates and FAQ**


We've been listening to player feedback regarding the below format removals and understand the desire for more information about these changes and how they'll help us focus our efforts to improve *Magic Online*. If you missed it, *Magic Online* R&D Robert Schuster answered some of the most common questions in a [recent post](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/132168258539/format-removal-qa#notes) on the official [*Magic Online* Tumblr](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/).


In order to focus our efforts on improving the most popular formats on *Magic Online*, we are removing official support for some rarely-played formats and player configurations with the November 11, 2015 downtime. Combined, the removal of the formats below represents less than one percent of play on *Magic Online*.


The full list of formats removed during the November 11, 2015 downtime are:


 


* Block Constructed
* Standard Pauper
* 100 Card Singleton
* Prismatic
* Legacy Tribal Wars
* Emperor
* All games with five or six players
* All team play, including Two-Headed Giant

 


Block Constructed and Standard Pauper decks will be moved to become Standard decks in the Collection scene. 100 Card Singleton, Prismatic and Legacy Tribal Wars decks will be moved to become Legacy decks in the Collection scene.


We are always looking to improve the player experience on *Magic Online*. Trimming our offerings will allow us to focus on improving the most-played formats, and will simplify the interface for starting a game.


For those looking for a game, here are our currently supported formats for up to 4 players:


 


* Standard
* Modern
* Legacy
* Vintage
* Planeswalker
* Pauper
* Commander
* Planechase
* Momir Basic
* Freeform Vanguard
* Freeform
