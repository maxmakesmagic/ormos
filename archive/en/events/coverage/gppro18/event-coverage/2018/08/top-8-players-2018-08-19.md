[Goblin Chainwhirler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chainwhirler). The card advances your board state, kills things, and blocks like a house. It’s insane.


**What was your most interesting play so far this weekend?** 


Resolving [Goblin Chainwhirler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chainwhirler) after the third part of [The Flame of Keld](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Flame+of+Keld).
