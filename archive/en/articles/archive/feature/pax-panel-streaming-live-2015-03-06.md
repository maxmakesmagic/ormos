Today at 3 p.m. on the East Coast, in Boston, MA, luminaries from Wizards R&D and brand teams will host a panel that will, to put it mildly, blow your mind.



R&D Design Manager Dave Humpherys, R&D Game Designer Ethan Fleischer, Senior Game Designer and creative guru Doug Beyer, and Global Brand Manager Liz Lamb-Ferro will all be on hand to give a number of tantalizing hints about the next several months, including a number of cards from *Dragons of Tarkir*, details about *Modern Masters 2015 Edition*, and an announcement we don't even dare tell you about until it happens.



And you can watch every minute of it.



Even if you're nowhere near Boston, the panel will be streaming live on [Twitch.tv/pax2](http://www.twitch.tv/pax2), which you can connect to right here an hour before the panel starts.



So tune in and get a glimpse of what *Magic* has in store for 2015.
