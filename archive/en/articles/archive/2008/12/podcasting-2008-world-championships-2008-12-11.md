* [**Worlds Highlights and Winner Interview**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/08worlds/worlds_highlights.mp3) (15.9 MB)

 Get the full picture of the 2008 **Magic**  World Championships in a little more than an hour. From key interviews and match recaps to Player and Rookie of the Year analysis, hear the highs and lows of **Magic**'s crowning moments—including an interview with new World Champion Antti Malin recorded just moments after he defeated Jamie Parke in the finals. As a way to mark his top finishes, Malin acquires missing pieces of the Power Nine for his collection. On the occasion of winning Worlds, listen in as he cracks a *Beta* Booster pack to see if he adds to his collection!





* [**Saturday, 9:30 p.m.: Soooooo Exciting!**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/08worlds/worlds6.mp3) (20.0 MB)

 In a world first, Rich Hagon is almost speechless with excitement as he brings you coverage of the penultimate round of Extended direct from the Feature Match area. As places in the Top 8 go up for grabs, the tension rises. All the winners, all the last-gasp losers, the full blow-by-blow of **Magic**  on the edge.





* [**Saturday, 11:13 a.m.: Full Throttle**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/08worlds/worlds5.mp3) (16.2 MB)

 There are plenty of players who don't do well with the whole concept of mornings, but at the pro level they don't get much choice. Pro Tour days regularly begin at 9 a.m. like clockwork, but at Worlds they've had a little more time to come to their senses. On Thursday there was the small matter of the Opening Ceremony and Hall of Fame Induction, and Saturday players in the individual competition get to relax (or 'chillax' as someone infamously described it) through the first two rounds. That luxury doesn't go to the National Teams themselves, who have to hit the ground running with a potential 18 points on the line. First-round action of the final day of Swiss gets us into high gear straight away. Or even straightaway. Vroooooommm!





* [**Friday, 7:15 p.m.: Round 12**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/08worlds/worlds4.mp3) (14.3 MB)

 The title may not be inspiring, but the matchups certainly are. Rich takes you inside the Feature Match area once more to bring you highlights from Frank Karsten v. Olivier Ruel, Yuuya Watanabe v. Kenji Tsumura, Gene Brumby v. Patrick Chapin, Ervin Tormos v. Masashi Oiso, and Helmut Summersberger v. Andre Mueller. Ten top players going head to head in matches that could crucially impact the Individual, the Team and the Player of the Year Races. Top-class action is just a click away.





* [**Friday, 2:30 p.m.: Ten Players, Five Matches**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/08worlds/worlds3.mp3) (16.3 MB)

 Join us in the Feature Match area as we bring you as-it-happens coverage of all five feature matches from the second round of Booster Draft action here in Day 2. Featuring a U.S. Team member, a Hall of Famer, one of the fastest matches of the weekend, two undefeated players, and Shuhei Nakamura fighting to keep in touch, and you have a round packed with drama, excitement, and killer plays. Click to tune in.





* [**Thursday, 7:45 p.m.: Time for Team**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/08worlds/worlds2.mp3) (16.2 MB)

 In our second foray into the world of audio entertainment from Memphis, we bring you the unfolding story of the National Team competition, featuring a head-to-head between neighbors USA and Mexico. It turns out that few things are more fun than watching three formats at once, showcasing multiple eras of outstanding cards, decks and plays. Starting the team portion in 7th and 8th, both teams will be looking to make their move. With 9 Points on offer for each team win, the standings are set for a major shakeup. 





* [**Thursday, 12:45 p.m.: The Last 24 Hours**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/08worlds/worlds1.mp3) (23.8 MB)

 Time to get the party started, as we take you to the player party at Graceland, talk to the Pros on the eve of Worlds, and then get straight into the trenches with the unfolding story of Round One. It's Standard here on Day One, and some amazing matchups get us under way. More than one hour of in-the-action audio starts your Worlds experience. Buckle up.
