Welcome to "On the Mirrodin Site," where we'll show off some of the week's highlights from the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/). This site is going to have a lot of content, so if you fall behind, just stop by here for the scoop.


### Card Previews


On **Monday, September 13**, Sunblast Angel appeared on the [Plains of Mirrodin](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#plains,hotspots;W8;0;). Two days later, on **Wednesday, September 15**, the [Swamps](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#swamps,hotspots;B5;0;) featured Tower of Calamities.


And today, **Friday, September 17**, there's going to be something happening in [the Forests](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#forests).


### Mirran Field Reports


When the Mirrodin Site launched last week, it contained reports from three characters: [Ria of Bladehold](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#!blog,499), [Farris of the Anvil](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#!blog,475), and [Kessla of Temple Might](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#!blog,472). In the intervening time, two of the characters' stories have added a chapter.


* [Kessla of Temple Might's story](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#!blog,448), part 2
* [Ria of Bladehold's story](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#!blog,446), part 2

Be sure to check the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/) every day to see what's new. And check back here on Friday to see if there's anything you missed.


Oh, and here's a tip! If you go to the [Forest](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#forests) and go all the way to the bottom right, there's a little "MT" that Mark Tedin uses as a signature. Click around the "M" and you might see a surprise.
