The finals of the Super Sunday Series Championship represented the dynamics of this event: A place where new players, veterans, and pros collide, become friends, and compete, with a mixture of all groups oftentimes meeting the finals. In this case, Gold-level pro Jason Chung faced off against relative premier play newcomer Shin'ya Saito to determine who would win this tournament.


Both Chung and Saito were on blue-black reanimation strategies, though Chung's deck was dipped into red for [Firebolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt), as well as the haste effect for his two copies of [Torrent of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Souls). The red gave Chung an advantage in this matchup, as Saito's reanimation plan would need to be a full two turns ahead of Chung's to properly race. Void, also provided an answer to an opposing [Inkwell Leviathan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkwell+Leviathan), which would prove to be powerful. That said, having an advantage did not mean having a guarantee, and Saito's tight play all weekend was likely to make up for a lot.


The Games
=========


Chung led off with [Night's Whisper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night%27s+Whisper) as the first play, discarding [Nekrataal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal) after his end step. Saito's first play, [Ticking Gnomes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ticking+Gnomes), met an [Eyeblight's Ending](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending), as Chung took 1 to fall to 17. Saito switched gears with Jayemdae Tomb, to which Chung retorted with the powerful [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). The piles flipped an unexciting four lands with a [Twisted Abomination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Abomination), with the creature being placed in a pile with a Mountain as three lands sat in the other. Chung quickly took the two cards.


With Saito still struggling to do anything big, Chung began to execute his game plan, using [Mystical Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor) for [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb), and then [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) to bin an [Inkwell Leviathan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkwell+Leviathan). This set up a [Torrent of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Souls) to bring the giant artifact creature back, which crunched in for 9. Saito had no way to deal with the [Leviathan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leviathan) in time, and quickly nodded before picking up his cards.


"All that cube drafting paid off," Chung said.

Saito, after some deliberation and sideboard, opted to draw first for the second game. He opened the game with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), taking Void and leaving [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), [Eyeblight's Ending](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending), [Torrent of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Souls), a Mountain, and a Swamp. [Prismatic Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens) was next, providing some acceleration or—in the case of Saito's third turn—some fixing to cast [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach). The discard spell robbed Chung of [Eyeblight's Ending](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending) and a Swamp.


[Night's Whisper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night%27s+Whisper) began to refill Saito's hand, and was followed up by [Carrion Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder). Chung, who found an Island after missing a color and a land drop on the fourth turn, let him get on to the board with [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger). That proved to stop nothing, as [Sengir Autocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Autocrat) produced enough tokens to ensure an unimpeded swing from the zombie creature.


[Peregrine Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Drake) gave Chung another blocker for any non-[Carrion Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) creatures, but the zombie had eaten the [Sengir Autocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Autocrat)'s army, including the autocrat itself, and Chung found himself at 13 after playing his land—a [Swiftwater Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swiftwater+Cliffs)—for the turn.


[Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) brought the [Sengir Autocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Autocrat) back for Saito, which gave him more [Carrion Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) fodder. [Tragic Slip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip) cleared away one blocker, and after one turn of chump-blocking the 1-mana zombie, Chung picked up his cards in the face of a massive 1-mana titan.

*Shin'ya Saito*


Chung chose to draw for the third and final game, and he showcased an excellent start, with [Night's Whisper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night%27s+Whisper) to dig deeper, discarding [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) after his end step. Saito was slow to get on the board, with [Wakedancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wakedancer) being his first form of pressure, followed up with [Wake of Vultures](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wake+of+Vultures). [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) brought back Chung's discarded [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder), then traded with the [Wakedancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wakedancer) on Saito's next attack.


While Saito had a good follow-up in a second [Wakedancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wakedancer), this time with morbid active, Chung went for an upkeep [Mystical Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor), finding [Toxic Deluge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toxic+Deluge) for 3 life to clear Saito's army away.


Saito, as a follow-up, had nothing, and a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) from Chung let him see why as his opponent fanned out [Inkwell Leviathan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkwell+Leviathan), [Sengir Autocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Autocrat), and a land. With no defense lying in wait, Chung deployed [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) to begin attacking, as while the hand wasn't capable of anything at that point, it would be if Saito drew more lands.


With Saito needing to deploy something, [Sengir Autocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Autocrat) finally hit the table. Chung, after thinking for a moment, decided to [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb), putting [Duplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant) into the graveyard. [Torrent of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Souls) for [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) returned the artifact creature to Chung's hand, and [Eyeblight's Ending](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending) got rid of the Autocrat and its serfs.


Of course, while this has been going on, Saito's draw steps—lands—weren't worthless. He eventually reached the mana necessary to simply cast the 7/11 out of his hand. Chung had an answer in his hand with Void…but unfortunately, lacked the red mana to cast it. [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) from Saito hit both that as well as [Torrent of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Souls), and the sigh from Chung signaled the end approaching.


With one more attack, Chung offered the handshake, giving Saito the match, the championship title, and the $6,000 prize that goes with it.
