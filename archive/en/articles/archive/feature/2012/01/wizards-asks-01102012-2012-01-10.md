*What was the **Magic** highlight of your holidays?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_markpurvis.jpg)**Mark Purvis:** Over the break I sorted through several hundred non-English ***Magic** 2011* cards I'd accumulated over the course of the year in order to put together a global set. I always try to put one card of each non-English language **Magic** is published in on each page of the binder, and I spend a fair amount of time scouring the internets for sources of foreign cards I'm missing.


But that's not exciting! The exiting thing was finding an error card among what I was sorting! I collect error cards, and we don't make printing mistakes very often anymore. But for some reason, the interior text box pin line on French [Ajani's Mantra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Mantra) was printed at about 95% of normal size, causing there to be a millimeter gap between the right pin line and the text box frame, as well as visible black shading differences along the top and bottom of the text box that are not visible on a "normal" ***Magic** 2011* card.

You might not notice it if you were just looking at the [Mantra d'Ajani](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=266208) by itself, but compared to a stack of other white *M11* cards, it stood out like a sore thumb! This was a highlight of my vacation because I love discovering variants on **Magic** cards. Also because my in-laws were staying at my house the entire vacation, causing there to be very few highlights.
