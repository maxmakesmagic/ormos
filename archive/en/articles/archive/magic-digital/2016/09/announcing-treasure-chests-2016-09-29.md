*Magic Online* Treasure Chests are a new type of prize coming to *Magic Online*! I explain them in the video below, and you can read more detailed information in this article. Also, if you haven't read [Worth's article on *Kaladesh* changes](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-online-economy-changes-2016-09-29) or [my article detailing the new Limited event structures](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-online-kaladesh-event-changes-2016-09-29), you should read those as well.

What is a Treasure Chest?
=========================


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/MD20160929_Treasure.jpg)


What can I find *inside* a Treasure Chest?
==========================================


You're guaranteed to get at least one of these virtual items in a Treasure Chest:


* **Curated Cards**—These are cards selected by *Magic* R&D for their desirability in *Magic Online*.
* **Modern-Set Rares and Mythic Rares**—Any regular rare or mythic rare in a set that's legal in Modern can show up in Treasure Chests.
* **Play Points**—You can receive different quantities of Play Points in Treasure Chests.

Most of the time, you'll also get two Standard-legal commons or uncommons. But sometimes one or both of them will be replaced with either a curated card or a Modern-set rare or mythic rare.


How do I get Treasure Chests?
=============================


You'll receive them as prizes for strong finishes in *Magic* Constructed Leagues as well as Vintage Daily Events. Like all League prizes on *Magic Online*, they'll be added to your collection once your course through the League is complete.


Once you have them, open them up! While Treasure Chests are untradeable, the cards inside can be traded. If you have multiple Treasure Chests, you can open them one at a time, or you can right click and open all at once—whichever is more fun for you.


These changes will take effect starting with the Wednesday, October 5 downtime.


What are the curated cards available in Treasure Chests?
========================================================


All right, we'll spoil some for you, if you insist.

The curated cards will also include the *Kaladesh Inventions*. On *Magic Online*, we felt it was a better experience to offer these beautiful new cards to Constructed players who want to put them in their decks, so we've put them in Treasure Chests instead of the *Kaladesh* boosters.


Later this year, the curated card list will be updated to include selected non-premium *Magic* cards from *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* and *Commander**(2016 Edition)*. This is the only way we plan to unlock these cards on *Magic Online*.


You can see a full list of the curated cards [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-curated-card-list-2016-09-29).

Finally, for each of the MOCS Playoff events in the 2017 *Magic Online* Championship Series, we will be awarding 25 Treasure Chests to the Top 8 players as well as 10 Treasure Chests to players finishing in 9th-50th place, in addition to the existing prizes for those events.


What additional details can you provide on Treasure Chest contents?
===================================================================


All Treasure Chests will contain one of the following: a curated card, a Modern-set rare or mythic rare, or a number of Play Points.


Most Treasure Chests will additionally contain two Standard-set commons or uncommons, but they may be replaced as follows:


* 1 in 4.5 Treasure Chests will have one of the Standard-legal common or uncommon slots replaced with either a curated card or a Modern-set rare or mythic rare.
* 1 in 239 Treasure Chests will have both of the Standard-legal common or uncommon slots replaced with either a curated card or a Modern-set rare or mythic rare.

Standard-set commons and uncommons will appear as from those sets. Each common will appear 2.5 times as often as any uncommon. These cards will be non-premium.


Modern-set rare or mythic rares will appear as from those sets. This doesn't include sets that were never Standard-legal, such as *Modern Masters* sets. Regular rares and mythic rares in these sets that have been banned in the Modern format are still included. Each regular rare will appear twice as often as any given mythic rare. This includes regular rares from older sets that lacked mythic rares. Timeshifted cards from *Time Spiral*count as regular rares for this purpose. All cards in Treasure Chests will be non-premium, with the exception of rares from *Eighth Edition* and *Ninth Edition*, which will be premium.


Curated cards are from a list curated by *Magic* R&D. Some curated cards may have multiple versions that appear. The frequency at which a curated card appears relative to others is also curated by *Magic* R&D. The rarity on the card shown reflects only the original printing of the card and is not indicative of its frequency of appearance in Treasure Chests. Curated cards are non-premium, including both *Zendikar Expeditions* and *Kaladesh Inventions*, with the same exception for rares from *Eighth Edition* and *Ninth Edition*, which will remain premium. 


If any of this information changes, it will be announced on [MTGO.com](http://www.mtgo.com/)
