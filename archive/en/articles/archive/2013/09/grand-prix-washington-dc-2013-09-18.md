Grand Prix: Washington DC
=========================

TJ Collectibles is proud to present Grand Prix Washington D.C.


The Dulles Expo & Conference Center overlooks the Nation's Capital. What more appropriate place is there to host this year's Legacy Grand Prix and enjoy the full range of Magic's most diverse format?


Grand Prix Washington D.C. is an event not to be missed just because you don't have a Legacy deck. Our side event schedule will be full of exciting events for seasoned and newer players alike. Ask about the PAX EAST Challenge. We also will have a tremendous array of dealers on site. Longtime favorite Magic artist Rob Alexander will be on hand to add to the flavor of a true Legacy weekend.


The tremendous hotel blocks we have worked out can't be beat. Inexpensive hotel rooms close to both the Dulles Airport and the Dulles Expo Center have free shuttles and some feature free breakfast.


Come make history November 15-17 at Grand Prix Washington D.C.
