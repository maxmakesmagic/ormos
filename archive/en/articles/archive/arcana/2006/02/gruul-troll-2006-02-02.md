Other than in the flavor text of [Blazing Archon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Archon), *Ravnica* had precious few references to the Gruul. However, there's a Gruul guildmember hiding in that set that you may not have known about.

The art description for *Ravnica's* 
**[Hunted Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Troll)** reads like so:


> *Color: Green, but associated with the red/green guild   
>  Location: Amid tall buildings  
>  Action: Show an enormous overgrown troll stomping through city streets like King Kong. Use the sketch of the BG-guild troll, but apply the RG-guild look/feel. In the air around the troll, four blue-aligned, urbanized Pixie 'hunters' (tiny humanoids with dragonfly wings, but these have city clothing) try to stop the troll with tripwires, arrows, whatever you like.  
>  Focus: the gigantic troll  
>  Mood: Like a monster movie, but replace Kong with a troll and the helicopters with pixies* 
> 

Dan Scott, who was on the concept illustration team for *Ravnica*, had created this sketch of a zombified troll for the Golgari guild. You may have seen it [early on](/en/node/632111) during *Ravnica* previews:

Even during *Ravnica's* concept illustration stage, the look of the Gruul guild was in the works. Dan was tasked with re-imagining his zombie troll with the red-green look:

Greg Staples' [Hunted Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Troll), actually intended to be an early look at the Gruul, was the result:
