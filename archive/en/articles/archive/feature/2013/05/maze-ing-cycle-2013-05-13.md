Patrick "Trick" Jarrett oversees web content and social media for Magic, and acts as the publisher of DailyMTG.com and Magic content on the web. He's an ardent Commander player and lover of the game he's played since Ice Age. 







Cycles aren't new to **Magic**, and *Dragon's Maze* as well as all of the *Return to Ravnica* block has plenty of them, but here's one that is not only a cycle which is tied mechanically but they also all have the work of the same artist.


I am talking about this cycle drawn by [Yeong-Hao Han](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Yeong-Hao+Han%22%5D):


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1231_maze.jpg)With so many amazing artists contributing to **Magic** it is somewhat rare to see a five-card cycle all created by one artist.


Yeong-Hao Han first created art for Commander's [Minds Aglow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minds+Aglow) but this block is really where he's done the majority of his art, from basic lands to a number of other cards you've seen across these three sets.


This cycle of cards provides excellent options in *Dragon's Maze*/*Gatecrash*/*Return to Ravnica* draft given the high density of gold creatures in the block. Go back and see what Limited Information's Marshall Sutcliffe [had to say about these creatures!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/li/243)
