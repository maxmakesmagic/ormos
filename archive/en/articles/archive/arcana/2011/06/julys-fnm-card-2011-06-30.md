It's Thursday, which means that tomorrow is Friday. And *that* means that tomorrow night is [Friday Night **Magic**](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=events/magic/fnm)! And since Friday is the first day of July, there's a new card being given out at FNM. Check it!


![Jace's Ingenuity](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/744_FNMCard.jpg)  
Each month a different foil card will be given out. The cards often feature original flavor text and updated wordings.


Since tomorrow is the first of July, that means the [Standard bannings](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/148a) go into effect. To remind you, that means that [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) is banned. And [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) is banned *unless it's part of the [War of Attrition](/en/articles/archive/new-phyrexia-event-decks-deck-lists-2011-05-19) deck list*. If this is the first you're hearing of this, [Aaron Forsythe's explanation](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/148) is highly recommended.
