**A quick look at some early picks, or ten things not to do with [Lavamancer's Skill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill).**

Franck Canu found himself with only Nicolas Labarre as a recognised player in his first draft pod. As everyone knows though, this isn't always a good thing in Rochester or any other form of draft. On the Pro Tour, the French have a reputation as erratic drafters, and this pod showed that absolutely insane picks are not restricted to the top french drafters.

### Pod 12

1. Sebastian Bernaud
2. Nicolas Labarre
3. Gregory Leininger
4. Laurent Payen
5. Fabian Verdy
6. Adrien Claudel
7. Mathias Veron
8. Franck Canu

![Arcanis the Omnipotent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arcanis+the+Omnipotent)Sebastian Bernaud opened a booster and took the best card, [Arcanis the Omnipotent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcanis+the+Omnipotent), although it's arguably close in power to [Lavamancer's Skill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill). Nicolas in seat couldn't take the Skill with a blue drafter to his right, so he took [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) and let Gregory grab the enchantment. It was a strong pack, and there was still a [Gustcloak Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Sentinel) for Mathias Veron in seat 7. This created a problem for Franck Canu since he had decided to force white, so he wheeled [Mistform Dreamer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Dreamer) and [Piety Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piety+Charm) to make his intentions clear and try to make Mathias back down.Pack two was a doozy. Nicolas took [Goblin Sharpshooter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sharpshooter). Now Gregory already had a [Lavamancer's Skill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill), there was another one in the pack, and Nicolas had first-picked a [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk), so it's difficult to find words to describe how bad his pick of [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) was. Perhaps there are too many players in the French Nationals. The [Lavamancer's Skill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill) eventually went to Fabien Verdy after Laurent takes a [Symbiotic Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Beast). Mathias didn' fancy fighting with Canu and took [Screeching Buzzard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Buzzard), leaving Franck to take [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) and [Piety Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piety+Charm).

Pack three also contains a [Lavamancer's Skill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill), so with a Skill and a Husk already it's easy to imagine the logic that led Gregroy to take [Hystrodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hystrodon). At least it was a good card. Fabian took his second Skill, with everyone staying in color at this point. Canu took [Ascending Aven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascending+Aven) to confirm that he was specifically forcing [Soldier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier)s, as well as another [Piety Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piety+Charm).

![Threaten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Threaten)Pack four was yet another shambles. Laurent took [Prowling Pangolin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prowling+Pangolin), a perfectly reasonable pick. Now at this point, Fabian had a [Swat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat) and two [Lavamancer's Skill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill)s. He's got a black player to his right, and the nearest blue player is four spaces away in seat one. At this point you would naturally think that if he ignores his [Swat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat) and tries to go Red-Blue, he will inevitably end up with a good deck. In any case there were only red cards in the pack for him – a straight choice between [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) and [Solar Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Blast). His choice was [Threaten](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten), slightly surprising given the fact he had qualified for a National Championship.He had a great chance to redeem himself in pack five – he opened virtually the best possible card – [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift). Of course he decided to fight for black with the three people passing to him and took [Swat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat), another great pick. Adrien got the [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) to go with his [Skirk Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando) and [Solar Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Blast), and looked to be building a very nice Red-White deck. Franck was still forcing the soldiers, having grabbed a Gustcloak Skirnisher and [Gustcloak Harrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier). Nicolas was in a very awkward position since he was in black-red with too many other black players at the table, and had to branch out into green.

One thing for sure was that the packs being opened were of a high quality. There were two Rifts, three Skills, and a [Starstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starstorm) in the first set of boosters, but luckily for the non-red players they were distributed at random among the clueless drafters.

Franck continued to take only [Soldier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier)s throughout *Onslaught*, and was rewarded in *Legions* when the white player two spaces to his right valued [Wingbeat Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingbeat+Warrior) over [Daru Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Stinger), gifting Franck with three. Nicolas struggled to deal with the madness to his left, although he did get a [Visara](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara), the Dreadful in his second *Onslaught* booster. He ended up three colors and will be hoping to draw his [Wirewood Channeler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Channeler) a lot.

Predictions : Franck 2-1, his soldier deck is very, very good, but there are just too many [Lavamancer's Skill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill)s and [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith)s around the table for him to realistically hope for a perfect record. Nicolas 1-2 : he wasn't helped by the other players, and his overall card quality is quite low. Given the drafting in the first five packs, who knows what will happen...
