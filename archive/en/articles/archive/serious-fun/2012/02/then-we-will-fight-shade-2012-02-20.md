Then We Will Fight in the Shade!
================================

Let me share a secret: horror movies scare me. No, no, I don't mean that they create a slight feeling of creepiness or dread, only to be quickly washed away. I mean straight up, look away, "I'm not watching this anymore!" knee-jerk reaction of flight. I don't turn them on and, when possible, I actively choose to turn them off.

You can blame my "good" parents who never desensitized me to gory horror movies. (Lack of desensitization includes horror-based video games, yet excludes the classic gib-splashing action of the *Doom*, *Quake*, and *Unreal Tournament* first-person-shooter series. You figure that one out.)

Of course, *Innistrad* and *Dark Ascension* have been tickling my sense of avoidance. I mean, [Abattoir Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abattoir+Ghoul) and [Screeching Skaab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Skaab) are things right out of my nightmares.

By Urza's beard, these guys seriously creep me out. Perhaps that's why I was so keen to build a Horde **Magic** deck when I learned about the format last year. And when I shared it with you, you ran with it as well. I promised we'd return sometime.

We're back, and now it's personal.

Kill Me Once, Shame On You
*Dark Ascension* brought a whole new level of nasty out to play thanks to two things:

1. There are more monsters eating more Humans. Things just aren't easy for you right now if you have that subtype.
2. Among the more monsters are even-better-than-before monsters, courtesy of the undying mechanic. Killing it once just isn't enough. Too bad.

Before we dive into the nasty new changes, let's step back and review the rules of Horde **Magic** again. I want to make sure the basics are clear, the exceptions are noted and explained, and everyone who wants to make the Horde their everything has the tool needed. (If you aren't interested, you can [jump past it](#afterrules).)

**Horde Magic****In Brief:** Horde **Magic** is a multiplayer variant where all players work together as "Survivors" to defeat an opposing "Horde" deck.

**Rules Rundown:** There's a lot going on in Horde **Magic**. We'll break it down into Game Play, Player, and Horde rules.

*Game Play Rules*:


> * The objective is for the allied team to survive, and eliminate, the Horde. Survivors win when the Horde deck has no cards remaining in its library, no cards in hand, and controls no creatures.
> * If the Survivors deal damage to the Horde, that number of cards are put from the top of the Horde's deck into its graveyard.
> 

*Player Rules*:


> * Up to four players total, and each player brings his or her own deck.
> * All players share their turns, *a la*[Two-Headed Giant](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/42 ), and contribute 20 life to the starting total (one player is 20, four players is 80).
> * The Survivors takes the first three turns, then alternate with the Horde.
> 

*Horde Rules*:

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/sf/sf183_skaabs.jpg)
> * The Horde is a hundred-card deck. (Take away a random twenty-five cards for each Survivor less than four on the team; three players face seventy-five cards, two players face fifty.)
> * The Horde is both token cards as well as regular Magic cards; the standard is fifty-five 2/2 Zombie tokens, five 5/5 Zombie Giant tokens (from *Zendikar*), and forty assorted Zombies and other spells.
> * The Horde's turns start by revealing the top card of the library. If it's a creature token, it is set aside. This process repeats until a nontoken spell is revealed. Then, all of the creature tokens are cast (as a Zombie creature spell that costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif)). Finally, the revealed spell is cast.
> * The Horde will only cast spells once per turn, at the start of the turn. (Anything that is returned to the Horde's hand remains there until the next turn, when it is then cast after the revealed spell for that turn.)
> * The horde deck has any amount of mana needed and will always pay additional costs required (such as from Sphere of Resistance; Propaganda; and [Kazuul, Tyrant of the Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kazuul%2C+Tyrant+of+the+Cliffs)).
> * All creatures the Horde controls have haste and must attack each turn if able.
> * If there is a choice presented for the Horde, such as when a Survivor casts [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), the choice is made randomly.\*
> * Tokens put into the graveyard, returned to the Horde's hand, or exiled, disappear from the game as per normal token rules.
