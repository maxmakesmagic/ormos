Day 1 Coverage



Welcome to Lyon, France, where this weekend teams from all over the world have gathered to test their mettle in *Ixalan* Team Limited!


And in this case, teams from all over the world was to be taken quite literally. Of course, team tournaments always draw players from near and far. For instance, Hall of Famer Ben Stark, Pro Tour champion (22) Alexander Hayne, and US national team captain (2) Reid Duke came all the way from the States to compete at Grand Prix Lyon together, while Pro Tour champions Jérémy Dezani, Tomoharu Saito, and Pro Tour *Amonkhet* semifinalist Ken Yukuhiro made the trip from Japan.


But the globetrotting wasn't limited to top-ranking pros. With the World *Magic* Cup in Nice just a few days and a couple of hundred kilometers away, many national teams decided to make a stop in Lyon too. No less than thirteen teams were competing in next week's line-up, including the trios from Greece and Guatemala, from Macedonia and Mexico, from Thailand and Turkey, and most notable of all: the Japanese national team of Hall of Famer (12) Yuuya Watanabe, Hall of Famer (11) Shota Yasooka, and two-time Grand Prix semifinalist Kenta Harane.


So stay tuned throughout the weekend for news and updates straight from the battlefield, and for lots of exciting matches featuring some of the game's biggest stars!
