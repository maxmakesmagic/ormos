### Nico Bohny


**Age:** 24


**Hometown:** Basel, Switzerland


**Occupation:** Teacher


**Number of Times Playing on the Pro Tour:** ~6


**How did you qualify for Pro Tour–Hollywood?** Top 50 at PT Kuala Lumpur


**Number of GP/PT Top 8s:** 1 GP Top 8 (Torino)


**Other previous Magic accomplishments:** Team Champions, Worlds 2007


**How did you prepare for Pro Tour–Hollywood? Who did you prepare with?**


I playtested with Matthias Kunzler & Christoph Huber from Switzerland, and discussed decklists with William Cavaglieri from Italy.


**What deck are you playing and why?**


Doran, because it doesn’t have any really bad matchups, and is superior to Elves in my opinion (especially because of the sideboard)


**How did your deck evolve during your testing?**


It didn’t evolve at all, I didn’t really test it, either. I tested a bunch of decks, but they all lost to Faeries, so I opted for Elves, but then switched to Doran.


**What decks was your deck designed to beat?**


It doesn’t really have good matchups, but it has a good sideboard and wins against red & elves, and can beat Faeries and other control decks.


**What is the worst matchup for your deck?**


[Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) and Green-white Ramp


**How worried were you about Faeries? How many cards in your maindeck and sideboard are dedicated to beating Faeries?**


I wanted to play a deck that was better than 50 percent of Faeries. I played some cards (e.g. [Riftsweeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper)) which are not spectacular against other decks.

**Other previous Magic accomplishments:** Making Level 4.


**How did you prepare for Pro Tour–Hollywood? Who did you prepare with?**


Just RL testing with Jim Herold.


**What deck are you playing and why?**


Merfolk. It’s a good deck concept, has good card quality, and good matchups against the decks we expected.


**How did your deck evolve during your testing?**


Many cards changed, lots of options were tried out. It was streamlined to have a good maindeck against faeries and a good sideboard for the mirror, mana ramp, etc.


**What decks was your deck designed to beat?**


Faeries: Over 50 percent, but still tough  
[Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark): Very good matchup.  

Elves: Also a great matchup


**What is the worst matchup for your deck?**


Mana Ramp without red and combo (didn’t test against combo, though)


**How worried were you about Faeries? How many cards in your maindeck and sideboard are dedicated to beating Faeries?**


There are only two sideboard slots against Faeries, because the maindeck is in good shape for the matchup. We expected about 25 percent of the field to be playing it.
