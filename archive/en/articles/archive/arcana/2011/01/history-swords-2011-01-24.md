One of the cards in *Mirrodin Besieged* is the Sword of Feast and Famine. Let's take a look!


### Sword of Feast and Famine

As you may already know, the Sword of Feast and Famine is part of an ongoing series of swords. This series started way back in *Darksteel* with swords featuring fire and light and ice and shadow. Not in that order.


### Sword of Fire and Ice

### Sword of Light and Shadow

After *Darksteel*, it wasn't clear if this was a cycle or just a pair of swords. And that's the way it stayed until *From the Vault: Relics*, which previewed the *Scars of Mirrodin* card [Sword of Body and Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Body+and+Mind).


### Sword of Body and Mind

And that's all of the swords ... so far.
