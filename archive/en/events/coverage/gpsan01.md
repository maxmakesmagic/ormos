2001 Grand Prix Santiago Coverage
=================================












2001 Grand Prix Santiago Coverage
---------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gp_lg.gif)Argentina's Matias Gabrenja makes history by tying the largest Grand Prix prize ever, winning the top Amateur Prize as well as the entire tournament (Gordon Lim was the first to achieve this feat at Grand Prix Sydney). He took out Superstar Gerardo Godinez's Black/Red/Blue "Mexican Lobotomy" control deck in a quick two games with his aggressive Blue/Green/Red beatdown deck. Not to be ignored, Chile's Team XOptimo placed four players in the Top 8. Congratulations to Matias Gabrenja!
