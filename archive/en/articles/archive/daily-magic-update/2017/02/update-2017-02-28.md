The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 28, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by a billionty previews today. That's an actual number. Probably.


Today's Previews
================


1. [Split Second: Exclusive *Modern Masters 2017* Preview!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34641_Split-Second-Exclusive-Modern-Masters-2017-Preview.html) | StarCityGames.com

StarCityGames.com often gets one of the more powerful previews, and today is no exception. Tune in for a special episode of Split Second that not only shows off the card, but flashes back to some of its history.


1. Ranger D'Eos | [Wizards of the Coast](http://magic.wizards.com/fr/articles/archive/card-preview/ranger-d%C3%A9os-2017-02-28)

Another exception to the "not posting our own previews" comes because this particular preview is only in French, fittingly, from the man who originally designed the card—Antoine Ruel.


1. We love you, Brian. We really do.

1. Harmonize | [Weibo](http://weibo.com/2643025570/ExBiuDZCB)

This popular Commander staple went up on Weibo overnight. Weibo is a Chinese social media site, so chances are you don't have access. The card was [previewed here](http://weibo.com/2643025570/ExBiuDZCB), but you can also view [an image of it here](https://i.redd.it/ykeschodhjiy.jpg).


1. A pair of previews for Asia-Pacific!

With [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade) appearing on the packaging, we thought we'd pair some previews for APAC. First up was [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade), [as you can see](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering.apac/photos/pb.681035948631936.-2207520000.1488251405./1284379314964260/?type=3&theater). That was followed by [this green sorcery](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering.apac/posts/1284452878290237:0)!


1. [Venser, Shaper Savant](https://www.facebook.com/aranelcosplays/photos/a.445182625537617.66968062.425515530837660/1223608354361703/?type=3&theater) | [Aranel Cosplay](https://www.facebook.com/aranelcosplays/photos/a.445182625537617.66968062.425515530837660/1223608354361703/?type=3&theater)

One of my favorite cards of all-time, and using the *From the Vault* art I also love. I'll take seven, please.


1. [A Sun Titan is Terminated](https://twitter.com/mtgjp/status/836410606668374017) | @mtgjp

It's new art for [Terminate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate), and if you're not a rabid art fan, you might miss the fact that it completes [a story in three parts](https://twitter.com/_SEV8/status/836412689903730689)!


1. [*Modern Masters* Preview Modern staples](http://collected.company/category/the-masters-of-modern/)

They've asked the question many times—what cards are Modern staples? These two uncommon spells certainly count.


1. [Sam Stoddard](https://twitter.com/samstod) will not be [trolling you](https://twitter.com/samstod/status/836242296395816961) today

Or he [might](https://twitter.com/samstod/status/836618740871524352).


1. [*Modern Masters 2017* Preview Card – Commanderin' MTG Podcast |](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/2017/02/28/e084-modern-masters-2017-preview-card-commanderin-mtg-podcast.html) Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Sean Whatson, and Nate Burgess

It might be among the most feared Commander cards, but it sure is going to turbo-charge some blue-white blink decks in Limited.


But, also, bonus love song to their preview card.

1. [In Which I Troll Frank Karsten Just a Bit](https://twitter.com/karsten_frank/status/836657055306027010)

Sorry, Frank. I know you love your robots.


1. [Commander previews unite!](http://collected.company/2017/02/28/modern-masters-2017-preview-121/)

You've already seen one Commander preview from [Commanderin'](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/), but could I interest you in another Commander preview? [The Command Zone](http://collected.company/category/the-command-zone/)'s up next in the realm of 100-card decks.


1. [Exclusive Modern Masters 2017 Preview Card!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOcHJGNVEIM) | Windmill Slam

Winmill Slam slams down a card you would certainly windmill slam onto the stack if you drew it.


1. [Magic Judge Blog](http://blogs.magicjudges.org/usanorth/2017/02/28/magic-judges-exclusive-modern-masters-2017-spoiler/)

This one can be a bit tricky rules wise—which is why we gave it to the judges! I'll let them tell you all about it.
