Entry fee varies from location to location. Check with the local organizer for specific information.


### Format





* The format for all Grand Prix—Kitakyushu Trial tournaments is Sealed Deck with Booster Draft finals.   

	+ Tournaments held before October 2, 2009 will use either 6 *Magic 2010 Core Set* booster packs **or** 2 booster packs each of *Shards of Alara*, *Conflux*, and *Alara Reborn* for the Sealed Deck portion of the Trial. For the Booster Draft portion of the tournament, if *Magic 2010* was used in the Sealed Deck, each player will receive 3 *Magic 2010* boosters to draft with; if Alara Block was used in the Sealed Deck, each player will receive 1 booster pack each of *Shards of Alara, Conflux,* and *Alara Reborn*. Check with the tournament organizer for information on which format will be used.
	+ Trials run on October 2 or later will use 6 *Zendikar* booster packs for the Sealed Deck potion of the Trial, and 3 booster packs *Zendikar* for the Booster Draft.
* Deck lists are required.

### Tournament Length





* Each round in the Swiss portion of the tournament will be 50 minutes.
* Top 8 matches will have no time limit
* The number of Swiss rounds will be determined based on attendance according to the following chart:



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Attendance | No. of Rounds |
| 9 – 16 | 4 |
| 17 - 32 | 5 |
| 33 – 64 | 6 |
| 65 – 128 | 7 |
| 129 – 226 | 8 |
| 227 – 410 | 9 |
| 411 or higher | 10 |

  
### Advancement





* All players may participate in all Swiss rounds.
* The top 8 players after the final Swiss rounds will advance to the top 8 single-eliminations finals. (If a Trial has exactly 8 players, the tournament shall consist of 3 rounds of single elimination.)

### Top 8 Finals





* Top 8 matches will be played using Booster Draft. Seating for the draft will be determined randomly immediately before the draft begins.
* Top 8 matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings.

### Notes





* All Grand Prix—Kitakyushu Trials will be run using Rules Enforcement Level: Competitive at 24K.
* All Universal Tournament Rules and **Magic: The Gathering** Floor Rules are in effect for this event unless specifically overruled by information in this format document.
* Players are responsible for bringing their own pen, paper, card sleeves, and appropriate counters.

### Prizes





* The winning player of each Grand Prix—Kitakyushu Trial tournament in Japan will receive an third round bye at Grand Prix—Kitakyushu (to be held October 31-November 1, 2009). If the winner of a Grand Prix—Kitakyushu Trial already has a third round bye, the bye does not pass down. Byes are only usable for the appropriate Grand Prix and cannot be "carried over" to another Grand Prix tournament.
* Additional product prizes may be awarded, as determined by the organizer.
