Beautiful, isn't it? Nine booster packs, a Spindown life counter, a Player's Guide, a card box, two deck boxes, a pack of forty *Return to Ravnica* basic lands, and a wrapper that can be unfolded into a mural. Very nice.

And now, let's move on to the *Return to Ravnica* Intro Packs. These are sixty-card decks designed to introduce new players to the themes and mechanics of the game. And each one comes with two *Return to Ravnica* booster packs!

### Azorius Advance
