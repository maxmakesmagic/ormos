Have you ever played a game of **Magic**? Then you know that sometimes, you need to destroy an artifact or an enchantment, right? Well, tournament players all over the world seemed to have forgotten just that very lesson. Going into German Nationals, Standard appeared pretty much solved. [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Squadron%2BHawk)-[Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sword%2Bof%2BFeast%2Band%2BFamine) was the overdog, U/B Control the hip anti-tech and [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle) was the other deck.


Funny story: Turns out, sometimes you need something faster than [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) to kill something. Like [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage), or [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). That were two major angles of attack both [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Squadron%2BHawk)-[Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sword%2Bof%2BFeast%2Band%2BFamine) and U/B Control had massive problems with, as champion Helge Nelson proved during the Standard rounds.


Nelson's story was remarkable. The 25-year-old PhD student originally was not qualified for Nationals and chose to try his luck and skill in the last-chance qualifiers on Thursday. When he entered his second *M12* draft tournament, skill and luck came together perfectly to carry him to a clean sweep 5-0 victory and the right to enter Nationals the next morning.


Nationals is a multi-format event and you cannot be the champion without also mastering the draft. *M12* proved to be an exciting, complex format that incited long discussions among the players how to make the best of it. Between the popular low-curve aggressive strategies, green-based aggro decks and blue-based control strategies, every player could find a niche.


When it came to the top 8 matches, [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Squadron%2BHawk)-[Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sword%2Bof%2BFeast%2Band%2BFamine) was nowhere to be seen, beaten by U/B Control which in turn had difficulty dealing with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) and especially [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage). The tables ran with fire as more than half of the Top 8 had red as their primary color. The German National Team – Helge Nelson, Tobias Dreger, Martin Zimmermann and Bernd Brendemühl – will certainly be looking at the red decks again come November and with it Worlds in San Francisco.
