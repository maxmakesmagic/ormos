**Upcoming *Kaladesh* Sealed PTQ on Sunday, October 23**


Attention all Pro Tour hopefuls: a Pro Tour Qualifier (PTQ) is approaching! The *Kaladesh* Sealed Pro Tour Qualifier Preliminaries begin Thursday, October 20, and run through Tuesday, October 25. We hope to see you in the PTQ Finals on Sunday, October 23!


Remember, you are no longer required to enter into the PTQ Finals immediately following the Preliminary that you qualified through, thanks to the redesigned PTQ system that *Magic Online* Events Manager Lee Sharpe announced [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-qualifier-changes-2015-11-16).
