GRAND PRIX YAMAGATA 2008
------------------------


Suzuki Defeats Star-Studded Field
=================================




November 17-19












[日本語の取材へ](/en/node/573041)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpyam06/champ.jpg)**Takahiro Suzuki is the 2006 Grand Prix Yamagata Champion!**


Richard Hoaen. Jelger Wiegersma. Antoine Ruel. Katsuhiro Mori. All of these stars made the Top 8 here in Yamagata, and all of them fell just short of winning the title, clipped before the finals by local amateur Takeshi Ozawa and Pro Tour-Kobe Top 8 member Takahiro Suzuki. Okawa made it past Yuu Murakami in the quarters and beat top seed Jelger Wiegersma in the semifinals to make the finals in his first Grand Prix Day Two. Suzuki had an even tougher road, beating Antoine Ruel in the quarters 2-0 and then outplaying World Champion Katsuhiro Mori in the semis to set up an unexpected finals pairing. In the finals, Suzuki won a tight Game 1 on the back of [Stormbind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbind) and rode Ozawa's mana screw in Game 2 plus [Spectral Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Force) to his first Grand Prix title.


An unofficial tally for the Player of the Year race puts Shouta Yasooka at 59 points, 7 ahead of Shuuhei Nakamura and 12 up on Tomoharu Saito, meaning both will need outstanding performances at Worlds and hope that Yasooka stumbles in order to catch up. That's all for the action here in Yamagata, but be sure to check back in less than two weeks for complete coverage of the 2006 World Championships in Paris, France. Until then, congratulations to Takahiro Suzuki, the Grand Prix-Yamagata champion!

Sunday, Nov 19: 9:04 p.m. - Quarterfinals: Rich Hoaen vs. Jelger Wiegersma
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Ted Knutson*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpyam06/qf%20jelger.jpg)They finished one and two at the end of the swiss standings, but the randomized pairings for Draft Top 8s means they are stuck squaring off against each other now. Jelger nearly ran the table this weekend, posting an awesome 13-1 record through the 14 rounds, losing only to Takahiro Suzuki. Hoaen started the weekend 6-2, but 6-0'd his two drafts. Coming out of the final draft, Jelger's blue-red deck looks slightly superior in card quality and he has card drawing to stay consistent, but you can never count Hoaen out. His black-red deck is a little creature-light but has a boatload of removal to make up for that fact.


Jelger won the die roll and obviously chose to play. Blazing-Blade Askari and [Fledgling Mawcor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fledgling+Mawcor) were his first two creatures of the game, matched by Hoaen's own Askari and a [Mana Skimmer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Skimmer). The Skimmer and a [Spiketail Drakeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiketail+Drakeling) from Jelger traded, while Hoaen used [Conflagrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conflagrate) to kill the Mawcor. [Dark Withering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Withering) dispatched [Clockwork Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Hydra) from Jelger, making the board a [Stormcloud Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormcloud+Djinn) for the Dutchie to Hoaen's Askari and [Coal Stoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker) and the life totals 15-12 in favor of Rich. Wiegersma cast a pair of morphs on his turn, later revealed to be [Fathom Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fathom+Seer)s that let him dramatically pull ahead of Hoaen in card advantage. Just as it looked like Jelger was going to go up a game, Hoaen flashed back his [Conflagrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conflagrate) to kill a blocker and put Wiegersma at one after his attack, with fingers crossed that Jelger would not have anything left. He didn't and Hoaen was now up a game.


Hoaen 1 - Wiegersma 0


Game 2 was a flurry of action, with both players throwing down spells and creatures as fast as they could. Turn 5 saw Wiegersma with a board of [Spiketail Drakeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiketail+Drakeling) and Blazing-Blade Askari to Hoaen's [Pit Keeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Keeper), but [Lightning Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe) on the Drakeling discarding [Avatar of Woe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avatar+of+Woe) drew some whistles from the crowd, especially when Rich followed that with [Dread Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return), giving the Canadian an Avatar on the cheap. Wiegersma wasn't done either, Axing the Avatar right back to the graveyard while continuing to beatdown with his smaller creatures. Hoaen fought hard to keep up, but was done in by an inability to draw lands past his fourth until it was too late.


Hoaen 1 - Wiegersma 1


Before game 3 began, Hoaen decided to concede to Jelger. Since Jelger was already four points ahead of him in the Player of the Year race and closer to level 6, Rich decided to give the points to Jelger. This drew an outburst of comic disbelief from Kenji Tsumura who had a split in place with Hoaen, and also realized that the win in this round put Jelger one point ahead of him in the race as well. Fist shaking and cursing of one's ancestors may have even occurred.


Wiegersma 2 - Hoaen 1
