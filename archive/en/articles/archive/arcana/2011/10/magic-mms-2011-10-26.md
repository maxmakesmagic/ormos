We've got something interesting to show you today, if you're in the United States. If you're not, go ahead and skip this Arcana. Go read [Savor the Flavor](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/166) instead. It's good!

Okay. Monday, as you may know, is Halloween. And this Friday is a special Halloween-themed edition of [Friday Night **Magic**](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=events/magic/fnm)! While retailer participation may vary, there ought to be cool decorations and special prizes. In particular, we'd like to highlight this item:
