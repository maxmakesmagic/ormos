What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [The LoadingReadyRun Pre-Prerelease](https://www.twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun/v/90099546)

The LoadingReadyRun Pre-Prerelease—where LRR shows off the new cards playing on stream a week before the Prerelease—happened yesterday, and it was a blast. I know because I was there! I was there, slowing down the whole proceeding and pushing the stream to 10 hours thanks to [a deck that was grindy and awesome](#deck)—and had trouble actually ending the game. You can check out the playback on [LoadingReadyRun's Twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun/v/90099546), or watch for it to get pushed to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/loadingreadyrun) once everyone finally recovers.


1. [StarCityGames Orlando Open](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/170916_orlando.html)

Bradley Carpenter took down [the Modern Open](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=28&start_date=09/16/2016&end_date=09/18/2016&start=1&finish=32&event_ID=47&city=Orlando&state=FL&start_num=25&start_num=0&limit=32) with Infect, but it was Tom Ross making the Top 8 with [8 Rack](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=107544) that had everyone talking (even though he, fittingly, [lost to Infect](https://twitter.com/Boss_MTG/status/777633686682468352)). Then again, Tom Ross could Top 8 with a deck of playing cards, so maybe it's not all that remarkable. There were also Standard and Legacy Classics, but the Modern Open is the part worth checking out. You can re-watch the event on the [SCGLive Twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive/profile).


1. [MTG - Top 5 *Kaladesh* Cards for Modern from *Kaladesh* for *Magic: The Gathering*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK_faP1aOsM) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

Over the weekend, The Professor took a look at the five best cards for Modern. It's pretty self-explanatory from the title. At any rate, check it out now that you've had time to both watch some Modern from StarCityGames and have had a bit more time to study the full [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/kaladesh).


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/yK_faP1aOsM>


1. [Story Spotlight: *Kaladesh*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csgQQnMFoVc) | Seibenlore

This one hit on Friday after that Update, but it's definitely worth watching if you missed it. Here Seiben goes over the five story spotlight cards, plus a few other story-relevant cards, and talks about what they mean for *Kaladesh* and the Gatewatch.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/csgQQnMFoVc>


Today's Must
============


1. [*Kaladesh* Limited Set Review: Artifacts](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/kaladesh-limited-set-review-artifacts/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

And so it begins—likely the most popular *Magic* set review series on the internet, Scott-Vargas's lengthy take on all of the cards in the new set is broken into two parts for each color—one for Limited and one for Constructed. Today, he starts with artifacts in Limited, and there were no end to the Vehicle puns. Nor should there be.


Also worth noting, [Quiet Speculation](http://www.quietspeculation.com/) has its own incredibly long series of reviews, but this time every reviewed card gets its own article by Ryan Overturf. They've been running these in the free section of their content for a bit now, and probably will be until the end of time.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Kaladesh* Through A Modern Lens](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33685_Kaladesh-Through-A-Modern-Lens.html) | StarCityGames | Jennifer Long

We know *some* cards from *Kaladesh* will make an appearance in Modern—but which ones? Long has a few ideas, plus a few new combos to get the brewers' hearts racing.


1. [A History of Technology in the Multiverse](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2016/09/history-technology-multiverse/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Rich Stein

This isn't some clever title to look back at powerful artifact cards from previous blocks, like I expected. Instead, it was way more fun and interesting. It's more of a Vorthos article, looking back at the technology employed on various planes, using that as a lens for revisiting a lot of old and not-so-old story. Cool article. It'd be a shame if Gremlins got involved...


What People are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Hey all, I've got something to tell you. On Tues, episode #41 of Walking the Planes will go live. It will be the last episode of the show.
> 
> 
>  — Nathan Holt (@WalkThePlanes) [September 18, 2016](https://twitter.com/WalkThePlanes/status/777604843217252352)

Trust me, they're going out with a bang. The episode—airing tomorrow on DailyMTG and going live at 8 a.m.—is one of their best, and an excellent way to close out the series. And don't worry, they'll still be doing cool *Magic* videos with us for quite some time.


1. [WMCQ Winners](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/53d039/wmcq_winners/)

The final round of World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers was held this past weekend, and a list was started on Reddit to capture the winners. There are some ringers in the final list—Valentin Mackl (Austria), Felix Tse (Canada), Thiago Saporito (Brazil), and Kevin Jones (USA) to name a few. [Check out the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/53d039/wmcq_winners/) and see who is representing your country come November.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. White-Blue *Kaladesh* Panharmonicon Sealed

Ok, to get all of the cards in this one, I would recommend checking out the [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/kaladesh), as it's all Kaladesh cards, which are not yet in Gatherer. If you watched the LoadingReady pre-Prerelease this past weekend, you saw a lot of awesome *Kaladesh* action.


But the coolest thing anyone did ever any time in any format ever—yes, ever—was my Panharmonicon-based White-Blue deck.


I might be overstating how great it was, but Panharmonicon and Cloudblazer made quite the duo, and a bevy of cards that let me bounce or re-use my "enters the battlefield" abilities helped me do awesome things over the weekend against some other great decks.


Panharmonicon does a lot of cool things in Limited, including doubling the energy creatures make when they come into play, doubling the effects of Puzzleknots, and even doubling the removal of Fairground Wardens.


The secret all-star of the deck, however, was Shrewd Negotiation, which—on multiple occasions—let me flip the script on some very scary opposing creatures for the totally reasonable price of a Servo or Puzzleknot.


The deck—and the format—was incredibly fun, and if you haven't signed up for a Prerelease this weekend, I highly recommend it. Check [a local store near you](http://locator.wizards.com/), and may you blaze so many clouds.
