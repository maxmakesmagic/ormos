Usually, the focus of our event coverage is on the players and their epic conquest of making the cut for Day 2, the Top 8 or in some cases some particular Pro Points threshold that would secure them Silver, Gold or even Platinum Membership in the Pro Players Club. While this article is also about leveling up, we're approaching the topic from a very different direction.


You see, all of these events wouldn't be possible without the help of our dedicated volunteers that are investing just as much time as many of the players do to ensure a fair environment where we can eventually crown the Grand Prix champion.


I sat down with Daniel Kitachewsky who has been promoted to a level 4 judge this weekend to ask him about how his journey started. Without further ado, here's the full interview.



**Daniel, when did you first decide to be a judge?**



"I started playing competitively in 2004 and in 2005, I decided to become a judge. I wasn't happy with the job the judges did in our local store and I thought that I could do better and that's how it all started.


"Since I knew the rules pretty well, I thought it couldn't be that hard and well, it's enough to get you started."



**So did you end up at a point where rules knowledge was no longer sufficient to level up?**



"In 2006, I already became a Level 2 judge - up to that point, it's mostly about rules knowledge. After that, I started judging at a lot of Grand Prix and the Pro Tour.


"I got a few backlashes since I was perceived as very harsh. I was very strict with the rules and I never thought of the many other aspects of judging, like the interaction with people."


"So basically, I had to learn a little more diplomacy to better interact with players as well as other judges."



**Can you give us an example?**



"If a judge made a mistake back in 2006, I would go up to him and tell him - sometimes even in front of the players - that he just messed up. It's much better to pause the game and tell the players that they need to wait for a second. Then you take the judge away, talk to him in private and after you worked out what went wrong, you're having him fix the game state so he doesn't lose face in front of the players. It's much better this way."
