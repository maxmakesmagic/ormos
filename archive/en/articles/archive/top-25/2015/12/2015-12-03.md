The Top 25 took a week off for Thanksgiving last Thursday, but behind the scenes, the rankings machine kept cranking out results. And with the Modern Grand Prix taking place in Pittsburgh two weeks ago, there were plenty of movers up and down the rankings.


Our biggest movers this week are Brad Nelson and Craig Wescoe, each up four slots. Wescoe, of course, earned his points the flashiest way, making the Top 8 of Pittsburgh with a green-white deck that sought to hate out the competition (and did so quite effectively). Nelson's finish was less obvious, but his 12-3 tally was good enough for 20th place and a handful of Pro Points.


Among the ranked, Sigrist put up the other stellar result, just missing out on the Top 8 by tiebreakers to finish in a disheartening ninth place. The distance was too much to make up between him and Samuel Black and Paulo Vitor Damo Da Rosa, but he did creep closer to climbing the standings. Black and Damo Da Rosa, meanwhile, swapped places as Black finished in 37th place.


The top of the standings remained, of course, unchanged, as Turtenwald and Manfield retained their death grips on the top two slots, well ahead of No. 3–ranked Eric Froehlich. None of the three are slated to appear at the World *Magic* Cup, so those standings are likely to remain unchanged.


In fact, the highest-ranked player who does get to show up in Barcelona is Paulo Vitor Damo Da Rosa at No. 6, followed by Mike Sigrist at No. 7. They have a long way to climb to make any progress in the Top 25 rankings, but with very few of their ranked brethren qualified, there's certainly an opportunity at hand.
