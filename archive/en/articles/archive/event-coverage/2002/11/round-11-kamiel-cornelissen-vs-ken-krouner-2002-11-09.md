### Game 1

Ken wins the flip and Kamiel has to mulligan. He mulliganed into [Krosan Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Colossus), [Underground River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+River), [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate), two [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor)s and a [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond), as Ken's [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) shows. Kamiel plays the [Underground River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+River) and passes the turn. Ken Cabal Therapies Kamiel, who Tutors in response. His other Tutor is stripped by the Therapy. A [Hermit Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermit+Druid) hits the board next turn, with the help of the [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond) and a [Forsaken City](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forsaken+City), making Ken look a little less happy.

Ken spends his next turn playing a [Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder). Kamiel fetches his [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) with the [Hermit Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermit+Druid), and Cabal Therapies Ken for [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed). He reveals just a [Spike Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) and a [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village). The [Spike Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) comes down next turn and the Elder serves, bringing Kamiel to 14 life. Kamiel does nothing, but when Ken attacks with his Feeder, Elder and Treetop, Kamiel blocks the Elder with the Hermit and activates it. Ken saves his Elder with the Feeder, and brings Kamiel to 9 life. Kamiel plays [Krosan Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation) on the 2 [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)s in the deck and [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)s the [Sutured Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sutured+Ghoul), attacking for 26 while going down to 1 himself.

### Game 2

Ken brings in a full arsenal for this: 4 [Phyrexian Negator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Negator), 2 [Coffin Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coffin+Purge), 2 [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) and a [Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes), taking out 2 [Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder), a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), a Feeder, 2 [Spiritmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger), a [Living Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death) and a [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed).

He has to mulligan his hand, and Kamiel keeps his cards after some thought. Ken brings out a Bird first turn, and Kamiel gets a peek in with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). He gets to take away Ken's [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), leaving a [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) and some land in there. Ken has no turn two play, and Kamiel takes away the Baloth with a [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), only to [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) the Baloth himself. Ken draws and plays a [Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder), Kamiel answers with a Mighty Mystery Morphguy and continues to play land.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a468.jpg)Kamiel's Baloth charges in and brings Ken to 15 life. Ken attacks back with the Elder, bringing Kamiel to 10, but he's losing the beatdown race to the Hermit deck as it is... Next turn Kamiel [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)es Ken, taking the lone [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) in there. Ken just thought it was a land, so Kamiel got to keep his morph guy. 

Ken: "Wow that was really bad"

Ken sacs the Elder at the end of his turn, looking for more business spells. He got one in the incarnation of [Recurring Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare), and got back his [Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder) by sacrificing his [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). Kamiel just attacks with his Baloth and plays a land. Ken gets a [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) in next turn, but finds only land in Kamiel's hand. Then a [Spike Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) joins the [Recurring Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) madness, and Ken fetches a [Spiritmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger) with a [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) next. Kamiel blocks the [Spiritmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger) with the [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) to give him some more time, as he was at 6 mana so far. He plays land and [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond) on his next turn, attacking with his morph guy. Ken blocks with the Elder, knowing well what the morph guy is. Kamiel taps 8 mana, and UNMORPHS the [Krosan Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Colossus).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a470.jpg)Now just think about that for a moment â€“ how often are you going to see a [Krosan Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Colossus) being unmorphed the hard way in a Constructed Tournament. At the same time at the table next to us, Jon Finkel cast a [Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life) to swarm John Larkin to death with 1/1s.

Unfortunately for Kamiel, he died two turns after his [Krosan Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Colossus) got [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict)ed next turn.

### Game 3

Ken looks somewhat nervous during shuffling, knowing full well that Kamiel's deck is capable of killing him before he has a decent shot at doing anything. Kamiel's double mulligan comforts Ken a bit, but when the second turn [Hermit Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermit+Druid) hits, that comfort is gone. Ken played a [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) first turn, a Dustbowl on his second along with [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), so he has no threats to Kamiel whatsoever. Kamiel plays [Bloodstained Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire), gets the [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and shows Ken the [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume). Winning on turn 3 after double mulliganing doesn't happen that often either...

**Final Result:** Cornelissen 2 - Krouner 1
