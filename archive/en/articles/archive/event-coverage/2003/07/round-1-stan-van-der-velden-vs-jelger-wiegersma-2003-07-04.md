![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/euro03/a993.jpg)This is certainly not the way they want to start Euro 2003. Playing against more than a countryman, more than a team-mate, against a friend. Don't expect to hear any of their witty comments because I haven't brushed up my Dutch yet.

### Game 1

Jelger started things with a second turn [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). Stan answered with [Mental Note](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Note) and [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) for [Flash of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash+of+Insight) and two [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Wiegersma just stuck to his "Land-Go" game plan, as Stan filled his graveyard with a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) (discarding land and [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation)).

He followed that with a flashbacked Analysis. Across the table Jelger's Verge gave him enough mana for a Wake. Things were about to heat up. [Far Wanderings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Far+Wanderings) gave Velden a few extra lands to work with. Another [Mental Note](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Note) gave Velden little to work with as both players filled the table with lands.

Velden used [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to pick a fight: he got his Man Short. With the Wake helping him out, Jelger set out on a quest for better cards. In an end of turn step he "cycled" five cards (using [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/euro03/a994.jpg)Stan flashbacked another Analysis and kept digging through his deck, discarding [Future Sight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Future+Sight) and a land for a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study). Jelger [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish)ed for [Opportunity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opportunity) and tried to draw four cards but Velden used [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to get [Seedtime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedtime).

Wiegersma got his four cards but Stan van der Velden got an extra turn. With Wiegersma tapped out he set out to work. [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest), [Future Sight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Future+Sight), a huge [Flash of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash+of+Insight), a second Harvest, a twelve-card [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze), another Harvest, [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for [Krosan Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation), a few more spells, [Reclaim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclaim) for [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze), [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze) for the win.

Stan 1-0 Jelger.

### Game 2

[Mental Note](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Note) threw two good spells into Velden's graveyard: [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation). A small [Far Wanderings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Far+Wanderings) and [Wild Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Growth) gave him some extra mana. Meanwhile Wiegersma was busy looking for help. He cycled two [Renewed Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith) and lost [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) before finding a playable spell: [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/euro03/a995.jpg)Velden resolved [Future Sight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Future+Sight) after a two [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) battle. Things were going downhill for Jelger Wiegersma. [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) untapped Velden and he tried to speed things along. He [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish)ed for [Seedtime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedtime) and played it.

He now had a brand new turn to play with. With the Sight's help he sped through his deck in impressive form. His found his remaining Wanderings but kept turning over lands with [Future Sight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Future+Sight). Yet, every single time he seemed on the verge of stalling out he found a way out of it.

Finally his [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) found him two [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Flash of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash+of+Insight). The Flash showed him eight new cards, amongst them the [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze). Wiegersma sat through the final motions but the writing was already on the wall: he was going down.

**Final Result:** Stan 2-0 Jelger.
