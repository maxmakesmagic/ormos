"Land Ahoy! ...yeah, but is it an Expedition?"

When you're opening a Sealed Pool at a Grand Prix, you're usually looking for something powerful that can really make things unpleasant for your opponent. Sometimes this can be a powerful artifact, or an impressive enchantment, but it's usually a hulking creature, and seldom ever a land. But on Zendikar, some lands are more desirable than others.


As I'm sure you're all aware now, *Battle for Zendikar* boosters very occasionally contain some truly stunning foil Expedition lands. Lands from Zendikar, and from further afield. Excited cheers were heard all across the tournament hall this morning as lucky individuals found Expeditions glittering at the back of their packs.


While some players were reluctant to appear in the coverage, hunkering over their "preciouses" and glaring at me (not really, they were mostly quiet and reserved) others were thrilled to have the opportunity to share their good fortune with you all.

*Stephen Wilson*


Brisbane's Stephen Wilson was the first to raise his hand, opening a [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta). Stephen's been playing *Magic* since Legends, which is over 20 years. There are players in this tournament who haven't even been alive that long.

*Traci Seaton*


Traci Seaton from Christchurch was next, with a [Canopy Vista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Vista) Expedition, as well as a regular *Battle for Zendikar* [Canopy Vista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Vista). Traci and I used to Judge events together when I lived in New Zealand 7 years ago, and somehow always manages to end up in my coverage. I don't know how she pulled off this time, though.

*David Franklin*


David Franklin from Canberra was next, with an [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb). David has recently returned to the game, and keeps mistaking me for a friend of his from Queensland called Kieran. Seriously David, I'm not Kieran.

*Clinton Hanna*


Sydney's Clinton Hanna had the biggest grin on his face when I found him, and was mostly chuffed with this [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground)s. Clinton started playing with *Onslaught*, so maybe he was hoping for a [Wooded Foothills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Foothills) instead.

*Jasper Grimmer*


Jasper Grimmer has travelled all the way from Germany, and opened a [Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool) for his efforts. Jasper was seated when I found him, but this photo doesn't do justice to just how tall he was once he stood up. I mean, he's probably still that tall. He was like, six foot eleventy or something.

*Chris Krause-Heuer*


Lastly, Chris Krause-Heuer from Bathurst approached me after round 1, after opened a [Godless Shrine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godless+Shrine) and (I guess) just not being loud enough in a room with over a thousand people.


While there were rumours that someone had opened a sealed pool with two Expeditions in it, we never found them, so like the hunt for Expeditions, the hunt for the fabled Two Expedition Sealed Pool continues. Maybe someone will open two in draft tomorrow.
