If you were keeping score from last round, William Craddock had called his deck a 7 out of 10—despondently. When he sat down next to the trophy this round, he looked at me and said, “I’ve downgraded this to a 4 out of 10 after playing with it.” The Oklahoma native had discovered that even though his deck was only missing two-drops, they were quite key to his Black-Red Vampire deck.


His opponent, Los Alamos, New Mexico, native Allen Wu, had also come to a realization. Beating a World Champion is fun. The Wu had just defeated third-ranked Seth Manfield in the semifinals with his blue-black, delirium-fueled, flier-laden goodness.


The deck matchup looked to favor Wu. Without two-drops Craddock wasn’t aggressive enough to beat Wu in the early game, before all the shields went up. So he’d have to lean on his [Uncaged Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uncaged+Fury) and [Magmatic Chasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magmatic+Chasm) to eke out the wins. But Craddock could certainly do that; he’d been doing it all throughout the Top 8.


**The Games**


**![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/gpalb16/Finals----Trophy-Shot.jpg)**


The two had dueling two-drops, both of which were antithetical to their overall deck’s goals in the match. Craddock cast [Sanguinary Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanguinary+Mage), a 1/3, when he was clearly the aggressor. And Wu cast [Furtive Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furtive+Homunculus), an evasive 2/1, when his deck was aiming to get delirium and control the game. *C’est la vie*.


But in this specific game, for Craddock, being able to hold off Wu’s aggression was a boon. With [Sin Prodder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sin+Prodder) on the field, he was getting incremental advantage with each turn that passed. He already got 4 life off Wu without having to attack.


Eventually Craddock committed to the combat step after casting [Markov Dreadknight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Dreadknight). But Wu was ready with [Compelling Deterrence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compelling+Deterrence). When the Knight came back down, delirium was all set up for Wu, and his [Kindly Stranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kindly+Stranger) became a [Demon-Possessed Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demon-Possessed+Witch). And again the Dreadknight switched zones.


Wu continued to control the board, especially with his new 4/4, and was taking Craddock down in tiny bits. But Craddock had been getting huge chunks out of Wu with the [Sin Prodder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sin+Prodder). Three different four-drops had hit the bin off the little Devil. Though no creatures of Craddock’s provided any combat damage, over half of Wu’s life was already gone. It was 11-8 in Craddock’s favor.

After a huge, board-clearing attack from Craddock, the battlefield was suddenly empty. It was a lone [Sin Prodder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sin+Prodder) against a few piddling creatures from Wu. His [Harvest Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harvest+Hand) transformed into a [Scrounged Scythe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrounged+Scythe) to make things a little less paltry. But flash exists, and Wu became the aggressor thanks to [Stormrider Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormrider+Spirit).


Just like that, the back-and-forth was through and Wu cruised to victory in the first game.


After shuffling up for the next game, Wu asked “You on the play?”


“Yeah.” A simple response.


“It seems like the choice for your deck.” Wu said. The two chuckled. It was a slight moment of levity between the players as they battled with gusto for a large sum of money.


In the second game, it was all about the little creatures. Wu had multiple [Furtive Homunculi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409807) and Craddock had multiple Zombies, little Mages, and a [Vampire Noble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Noble).


The two combatants hit away at each other until the scores were 12-10 for Craddock. Both were having trouble getting a true edge on the board.


That is, until Craddock made a move.


He emptied his hand to one card, and filled his side with as many creatures as he could muster. On his next turn, into six untapped lands from a blue-black deck, Craddock cast his last card, a [Magmatic Chasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magmatic+Chasm), with lethal on the board.

“All in, boys,” Craddock says as he pushed his creatures sideways, hoping for the best.


Wu thought for a while, but it was all for naught. He thought naught. The games were even at one a piece.


In the third and final game, the decks’ starts were opposite from Game 1. Each player’s first spells were actually fitting to the matchup. Craddock had Insolate Neonate into a [Bloodmad Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodmad+Vampire), and Wu cast [Erdwal Illuminator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erdwal+Illuminator) and a [Kindly Stranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kindly+Stranger). There we go, that feels more comfortable. Aggro is aggro-y; control is control-y.


But then Wu threw us for a loop again, as he turned a corner very early in the match. He used [Dead Weight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+Weight) to kill the 4/1 Vampire, then had [Pore Over the Pages](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pore+Over+the+Pages) to complete the delirium quadfecta. That [Kindly Stranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kindly+Stranger) became not so kindly, and Craddock was struggling to have any board presence at all.


Again the blue-black deck was looking uncharacteristically aggressive, and Craddock couldn’t keep up.


The Oklahoman sunk quickly to 8 life, then 1.


But even that life total was not long for this world. After the attack step, Wu cast and sacrificed [Explosive Apparatus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Apparatus) to take the final life point. This match was over.


**Allen Wu is the Grand Prix Albuquerque Champion!**
