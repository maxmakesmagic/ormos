There's a lot of joy that comes with the release of a new set. The joy of marveling over new art, getting acquainted with new characters, learning new mechanics, and, of course, the joy of discovering the wild and crazy things these new cards can do in conjunction with each other. From gaining infinite life to dealing infinite damage to having the best of both those worlds, new *Kaladesh* cards have opened a suite of fun new combos.

[Durable Handicraft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durable+Handicraft) is an uncommon enchantment from *Kaladesh* that combines well with creatures with persist. When you put a +1/+1 counter on a creature with a -1/-1 counter on it, both counters disappear, leaving your creature ready to live and die and live again, again.

Played with a creature like [Glen Elendra Archmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glen+Elendra+Archmage), this pairing of persist and [Durable Handicraft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durable+Handicraft) results in a virtually infinite number of [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)s. Great value like this isn't the only upside of the interaction between the *Kaladesh* enchantment and persist.


All we need to build a game-winning value engine is a way to sacrifice our creatures with persist, ideally in a way that generates mana. [Ashnod's Altar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashnod%27s+Altar) fits the bill, allowing us to sacrifice our persistent creature for two mana, one of which can be used to pay to put a +1/+1 counter on it with [Durable Handicraft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durable+Handicraft) while the other is left floating.


If we sacrifice [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) to [Ashnod's Altar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashnod%27s+Altar), we can gain infinite life and generate infinite colorless mana. If we sacrifice [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap), we can deal infinite damage to our opponents.

If the above options are a little too straightforward for your taste, or you'd like to throw another new *Kaladesh* card into the mix, you can use [River Kelpie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Kelpie) in place of the Finks or the Redcap to draw your entire deck. With a [Laboratory Maniac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laboratory+Maniac) in play, you'll win the game on the spot. With [Fateful Showdown](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fateful+Showdown), you can change those cards in hand into direct damage to your opponent's face.


If doming your opponents for lethal sounds like the perfect end to a game of Commander, another new card from *Kaladesh* can get the job done with just a little prep work. [Sydri, Galvanic Genius](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sydri%2C+Galvanic+Genius) is eager to get her hands on [Aetherflux Reservoir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflux+Reservoir), as her second ability is key to pulling your life total up above 50 so you're able to activate the Reservoir. It's Sydri's first ability, however, that will help you combo-kill all your opponents in a single turn.


As soon as you're above 50 life—anywhere above 50—Sydri can animate [Aetherflux Reservoir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflux+Reservoir) and then give it lifelink. Attacking with your new 4/4 would be too droll, so instead you can pay 50 life to deal 50 damage to an opponent—and, thanks to lifelink, you'll gain that 50 life right back, meaning you're able to finish off the entire table.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sydri%2C+Galvanic+Genius)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sydri%2C+Galvanic+Genius) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aetherflux+Reservoir)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflux+Reservoir)
But perhaps winning via damage isn't quite your style, and you'd rather mill your opponents out of the game. In that case, *Kaladesh* offers a new combo in which you can both cast giant creatures and never deign to attack your opponents with them.


[Metalwork Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalwork+Colossus) is one of several metal monsters constructed by the ingenious inventors on *Kaladesh*. It already works well in a deck loaded with artifacts. With [Altar of Dementia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+Dementia) in play, it becomes a flexible way to help win the game. You can either sacrifice the Colossus to mill yourself and find more copies to return to your hand and cast, or you can sacrifice the Colossus to mill your opponent before returning it to your hand and repeating until they have no more cards in their library.


And fine, if you can't find an [Altar of Dementia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+Dementia) or someone was savvy enough to destroy it, you can always just attack your opponents with a 10/10 or two.



[![Metalwork Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=417795&type=card)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=417795)   [![Metalwork Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=417795&type=card)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=417795)
*Well, I guess I could attack...*
If you're looking for combos you might crack in the most recent or the current set, there are a few already out there and more to discover every day! A pair of [Wispweaver Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wispweaver+Angel)s and a [Pious Evangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pious+Evangel) will gain you infinite life, while a [Whirler Virtuoso](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirler+Virtuoso), a [Panharmonicon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon), and a pair of [Decoction Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decoction+Module)s will net you infinite Thopters and infinite energy.


These are just a handful of the combos to be found across various formats with *Kaladesh*, and the best way to find the yet-undiscovered ones is to sit down with a set of friends, a set of cards, and a pen and paper handy, because you're going to have a lot of ideas. Happy inventing!
