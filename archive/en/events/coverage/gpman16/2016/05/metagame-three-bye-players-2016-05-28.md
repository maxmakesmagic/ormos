With over 1,600 players in the room, there's no chance we could tell you about the whole of the Day 1 metagame. Something we can tell you about, however, is the deck choices of the 15 players with three byes:


* (19) Lukas Blohon
* Marco Cammilluzzi
* Marcio Carvalho
* Pierre Dagen
* Martin Dang
* Antonio Del Moral Leon
* Patrick Dickmann
* Javier Dominguez
* Grzegorz Kowalski
* Magnus Lantto
* (11) Joel Larsson
* Shi Tian Lee
* Raphaël Lévy
* (7) Martin Müller
* Petr Sochurek

Here's the archetype breakdown of what this group of Hall of Famers, Gold pros, and Platinum pros are playing:


* Naya Midrange – 3
* Grixis Control – 2
* Green-White Tokens – 2
* Sultai Seasons Past – 1
* Mono Blue – 1
* White-Black Midrange – 1
* Four-Color Rites – 1
* Abzan Rites – 1
* Green Dragons – 1
* Bant Company – 1
* Bant Humans – 1

So if the choices of these 15 veterans are any indication, then Naya Midrange is the best choice in Standard right now. But there are plenty of sweet decks in here.


Tune in later this weekend, when we have more detailed overviews and deck techs for you. So if you're curious what "Mono Blue," "Abzan Rites," or "Green Dragons" could be, then we'll have you covered!
