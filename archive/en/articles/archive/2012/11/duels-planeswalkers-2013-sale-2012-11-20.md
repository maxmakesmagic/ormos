Let's say you've been holding off on buying **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2013. That's okay. You've probably just been waiting for a big sale. And your time has come! Because **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2013 and the expansion are both 50% off on all four platforms right now! The sale lasts until November 26, 2012, on XBox Live Arcade, and until November 27, 2012, on Playstation Network, Steam, and iOS!


Okay, now that that's out of the way, let's quickly recap what exactly **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2013 is. The first thing you should know is that it might be called "**Magic** 2013" on your platform. This is because it's got a lot of crossover with the ***Magic** 2013* Core Set!


The [core **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2013 game](/en/node/631806) has ten decks that you can play in regular matches and *Planechase* multiplayer against either the computer or your friends.


The [**Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2013 expansion](/en/node/631546) adds five new playable two-color decks, each corresponding with one of the *Return to Ravnica* guilds (Azorius, Golgari, Izzet, Rakdos, and Selesnya), along with new campaign levels and challenges. Like the core game, it's 50% until November 26 or 27, 2012.


And then there's the first [**Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2013](/en/node/631451) Deck Pack, which has two new decks. They're not on sale, but they're well worth the price!
