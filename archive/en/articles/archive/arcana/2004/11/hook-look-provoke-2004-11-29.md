Throwback Week isn't all about [Feral Throwback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Throwback), but here's an interesting factoid about that beast and its provoking brethren anyhow.


The *Legions* creatures with the provoke ability, including [Feral Throwback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Throwback), are tied together with a common visual cue. [All the provoke creatures](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=provoke&fields=%7Crules&format=Legions&color=All&output=summary&sort=name&first=1) have a hook element in their art, whether it be a [Krosan Vorine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Krosan%2BVorine), [Crested Craghorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crested%2BCraghorn), or a [Lowland Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lowland%2BTracker). The flavor is that the hooks allow the creatures to grapple others and draw them into combat with them. 






Enjoy the rest of Throwback Week!
