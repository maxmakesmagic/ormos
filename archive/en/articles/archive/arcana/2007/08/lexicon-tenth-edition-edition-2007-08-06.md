The goal of the [Lexicon](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=lexicon) is to teach players the meanings of some of the more obscure words we use in card names. While many of the offbeat names (like "[Scalpelexis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalpelexis)") are simply made up, we often dig around dictionaries for real little-used and archaic words for inspiration. Since many of *Tenth Edition’s* cards came from sets that never had an edition of the Lexicon devoted to them, check out these words drawn from old favorites in *Tenth*.
