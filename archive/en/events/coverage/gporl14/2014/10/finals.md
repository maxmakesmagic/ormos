 Between touring the world and earning a Top 8 at Grand Prix Santiago and breaking through with a Top 8 at Pro Tour *Gatecrash*, sitting at the Finals of another Grand Prix had been overdue for Melissa DeTora.



After quietly earning 5-0-1 in the draft rounds – drawing at the end to put herself and teammate Frank Lepore into the Top 8 together – DeTora had continued her march to the top unabated. With a passion for Limited and competitive pedigree to prove it, this looked like her title to win.


Eugene Hwang had just one Grand Prix Top 8 to his name as well, from Vancouver earlier this year. With his previous appearance on the back of a Standard deck, Hwang was emerging as a player to watch. Earning two Grand Prix Top 8 appearances in a year, in different formats no less, is not an easy feat.


It's a surprise coming from a player that was planning to walk away from the game. With just Grand Prix Los Angeles left on his schedule, Hwang had an exit strategy in place. Earning an invite and airfare to a Pro Tour has a way of changing one's mind on such matters.



**The Decks**




 DeTora's march to the Finals was built on a deck full of value. With beefy creatures and [Temur Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Ascendancy) together, making a steady stream of creatures with 4 or more power would be easy. [Temur Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Charm), [Savage Punch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Punch), and [Force Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Away) all synergized to buy her time to get there, or keep her ahead once the muscle was online. Behind it all, just two [Temur Banner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Banner)s and two nonbasic lands – [Rugged Highlands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rugged+Highlands) and [Wooded Foothills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Foothills) – were there to help her piece it all together.




 Hwang's deck seemed built to prey on DeTora's slower machine. With plenty of two-drops to apply early pressure, Hwang had also tapped into the power of morphs with [Ghostfire Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostfire+Blade). Able to construct a 4/4 attacker from just colorless cards meant it mattered less what his mana was making: There would always be another threat. With [Mardu Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Charm), [Burn Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burn+Away), and other removal to support an early rush, Hwang had cut down both his Semifinal and Quarterfinal opponents quickly. Two copies of [Mardu Roughrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Roughrider) had seen to that throughout the Seimifinal and Quarterfinal matches.



Would it be value or speed that would take the final match of Grand Prix Orlando?



**The Games**




 Hwang may have gone second, but his early [Ghostfire Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostfire+Blade) and stream of morphs meant his aggressive deck was off to the races first. DeTora used [Alpine Grizzly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpine+Grizzly) and [Temur Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Charm) to slow things down, but Mardu Hordeshrieker into yet another morph tilted the battlefield back towards Hwang.




[Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning) cleared the [Alpine Grizzly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpine+Grizzly), and Hwang dropped DeTora to 11 life on the next attack. [Smoke Teller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smoke+Teller), after drawing off [Temur Banner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Banner), left DeTora with one card in hand. [Mardu Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Charm) cleared the blocker for Hwang, and both [Force Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Away) and Bear's Companion on the turn after bought DeTora some time.
