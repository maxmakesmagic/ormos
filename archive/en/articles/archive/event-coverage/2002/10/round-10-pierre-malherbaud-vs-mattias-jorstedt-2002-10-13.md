Pierre Malherbaud – "We were both on the wrong side of the table."

### Game 1

Their starts in game 1 were also less than impressive. Malherbaud started cycling early in search of land. One of those was a [Death Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Pulse) and it handily took out Jorstedt's [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher). Jorstedt didn't really have any offence. He dropped a [Crown of Vigor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Vigor) on a [Wirewood Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Elf) only for Malherbaud to [Swat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat) it, and then didn't play anything until he dropped successive [Grassland Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grassland+Crusader)s on turns 6 and 7.

Meanwhile Malherbaud was bashing away with a [Thrashing Mudspawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrashing+Mudspawn). When the Crusaders clogged up the ground he kept pecking with a [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) and dropped successive [Symbiotic Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Beast)s.

Jorstedt's deck continued to refuse to cough up anything helpful and a [Taunting Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taunting+Elf) sent his blockers astray as the fat monster's piled by.

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop02/a912.jpg)Mattias started off with his own [Taunting Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taunting+Elf), and a turn three Morph. Pierre answered with a [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) and decided not to block. Mattias increased his ground force with a [Barkhide Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler) and a [Snarling Undorak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snarling+Undorak), whereas Malherbaud could only add a [Screeching Buzzard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Buzzard).

Jorstedt's beasts traded hits with Pierre's [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion), and when his Morph was blocked by Pierre's Buzzard it was revealed to be a [Treespring Lorian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treespring+Lorian). Pierre's life total was then low enough for Mattias to send over his [Taunting Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taunting+Elf)-powered army for the game.

Malherbaud 1 – Jorstedt 1

### Game 3

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop02/a913.jpg)Jorstedt had to start the third game off with a mulligan. He started off reasonably quickly regardless, with a [Birchlore Rangers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birchlore+Rangers) enchanted by [Crown of Vigor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Vigor) swinging in on the second turn.

Pierre made a Morph and Mattias used [Vitality Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitality+Charm) to get his Rangers through that obstacle. He then played an [Elvish Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior), leaving himself with only two cards in hand. Despite having no creatures in play Pierre decided to use [Explosive Vegetation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Vegetation) on his fourth turn. Jorstedt's attack knocked Pierre to thirteen, and he played an Undorak. The Frenchman used his seven mana to play [Festering Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin), [Taunting Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taunting+Elf), and [Thrashing Mudspawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrashing+Mudspawn). Only Jorstedt's Undorak attacked, trading with the Mudspawn and knocking Pierre to nine. Mattias then played a pair of [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher)s. Even though Pierre managed to topdeck a [Symbiotic Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Wurm), it was nowhere near enough to lower Mattias's life total as there were five elves in play.

Jorstedt added a [Crowd Favorites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crowd+Favorites), a [Grassland Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grassland+Crusader) and a [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) as Pierre continued to topdeck land. The Favorites allowed him to tap Pierre's Wurm, and alpha-strike for the game.

**Final Result:** Mattias Jorstedt defeats Pierre Malherbaud 2-1
