We asked a couple of the best players in the room which card they had to re-evaluate the most during their time playing *Khans of Tarkir* Limited. Here's what they had to say:

***Patrick Dickmann:** [Throttle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throttle). I thought the card looked good and it still isn't bad, but somehow it just keeps disappointing me.*

***Willy Edel:** [Arrow Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrow+Storm). Initially, the card seemed so slow and clunky, sorcery and all. But with raid it basically kills anything in the format and it's an awesome finisher. And people never play around it!*

***Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:** [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning). A big adjustment here, because we just came from a format where it would have been very good, and now it's hard to even get a two-for-one with it. Also, [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury). At first it looked so mana efficient, killing a morph and being up a mana. But you can hardly ever use the one mana you save, so it's really just trading even.*

***Shahar Shenhar:** [Rush of Battle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rush+of+Battle). That went up by a lot.*

***Fabrizio Anteri:** I played a lot of Abzan originally, but I don't like that deck at all anymore. As for a specific card ... [Longshot Squad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longshot+Squad) seemed good at first, and it really is not.* 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpstr14/qq_juza.jpg)
***Martin JÅ¯za:** All the pump spells like [Awaken the Bear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awaken+the+Bear) and [Dragonscale Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonscale+Boon) went up in my estimation. Though that may just be because I keep drafting blue-green tempo decks.*
