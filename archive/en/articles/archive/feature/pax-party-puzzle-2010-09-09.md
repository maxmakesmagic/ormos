Pretend you're at the PAX Party. If it helps, [reread yesterday's Arcana](/en/articles/archive/pax-party-2010-09-08). As you enter, you're given a sheet of paper that says this:


### Assault on Mirrodin


**PAX Prime Scavenger Hunt**


Find each of the listed *Scars of Mirrodin* preview cards at the party. Find words on the card that match its clues, and write the answers in the blanks. Always write the word from the card, not any changes you would make to it while solving a clue. The two answers to #11 cannot be entered until the Blue Sun phase and the Red Sun phase.


Excited, you dive into the party. Oversized *Scars of Mirrodin* cards are everywhere. And you begin to solve.


At this point, we break out of the illusion. But we have the puzzles! Which, we should mention, were created by [Lone Shark Games](http://www.lonesharkgames.com/), who were responsible for all the puzzling at both PAX Prime and Pro Tour–Amsterdam (which had its own set of [entry puzzles](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/assault-mirrodin-puzzles-2010-09-04) and its own [party](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/feature-assault-mirrodin-party-2010-09-04)).


When you think you know the answer to a puzzle, click on the hint to see if you were right. And then scroll down to the bottom for the next phase.


The Red Sun and Blue Sun turned out to be difficult to replicate online, so we're giving you them for free.

By now, you've gotten all the answers (or stared blankly for a few seconds, then looked at the answer by clicking to see it). If this were the PAX Party, you would now decide whether you're Phyrexian or Mirran. The Mirrans keep the answers on the right side and the Phyrexians keep the answers on the left.


At the party, each faction selected its five champions with the next five puzzles. Each puzzle works on each side of the answers, but Phyrexians and Mirrans got different answers. The first person on each side who texted in the correct answer got to be a champion.



> 
> WHITE is the color of sharing. One word in your list makes a new common noun if you replace its second letter with the second letter of the one above it. Name that noun.
> 
> 
> BLUE is the color of knowledge. You have two words whose letters score 1 point each in Scrabble. Take the word between them and scramble it into a word ending in E. Name that word.
> 
> 
> RED is the color of destruction. The first letters of all eight prime-numbered words can be rearranged to make what explosives enthusiasts love. Name the rearranged word.
> 
> 
> GREEN is the color of life. If you read several consecutive even-numbered letters in one column, you'll find a plural noun for some Magic creatures. Name those creatures.
> 
> 
> BLACK is the color of darkness. Reading diagonally upward starting with one word's first letter is a substance that is often black. Name that substance.

For the answers, you'll have to come back tomorrow. We'll put the answers down at the bottom of the Wallpaper of the Week Arcana.
