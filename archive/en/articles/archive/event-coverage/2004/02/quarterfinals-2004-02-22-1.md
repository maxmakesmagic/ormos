He had one in Munich just last season, in Limited as well. Gundersen is the last undefeated player of the tournament storming through the Swiss to end the fifteen rounds with an amazing forty points. ### Game 1

Thomas started with a [Viridian Longbow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) and [Silver Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr) to Dirk's [Leaden Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) and Arcbound Hybrid. The [Silver Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr) grabbed the bow and shot down the opponent Myr. Dirk played a [Vulshok Battlegear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear), while Thomas played [Lightning Greaves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves), [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite), [Bottle Gnomes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+Gnomes), and put the greaves on the frogmite and attacked with it.

Dirk equipped the Hybrid with the gear, and started taking chunks out of Thomas life.  
 A Drill Skimmer and an [Arcbound Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger) proved too much for Thomas defenses and he conceded.

### Game 2

Both players played Myrs and traded them in combat. Thomas cast another Myr and a [Woebearer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woebearer) to Dirk's Krark Clan Grunt and Drill Skimmer. The skimmer died to an [Essence Drain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Drain) and [Woebearer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woebearer) brought the dead Myr back from the graveyard. Dirk increased his army with an Arcbound Hybrid, another Drill Skimmer and [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite).

 Thomas response came with [Nim Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Replica) and [Memnarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch). The players traded some creatures for a while, the [Memnarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch) "killed" the [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) (Dirk sacrificed it to the grunt) and was taken down with an [Echoing Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Ruin).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmad04/qf3_2.jpg)A [Nuisance Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nuisance+Engine) comes to Dirk's help. With the engine he was now able to create blockers wich can be sacrificed for his grunt, unbalancing the combat phase. Thomas played an [Icy Manipulator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Manipulator) and a [Quicksilver Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Behemoth), but the skimmer kept picking on his life.

A [Wail of the Nim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wail+of+the+Nim) resolved the Skimmer problem, but an [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) on the Behemoth allowed Dirk's non-flying creatures to start attacking. An [Awe Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awe+Strike) from Dirk kept him alive and he was able to win the damage race.
