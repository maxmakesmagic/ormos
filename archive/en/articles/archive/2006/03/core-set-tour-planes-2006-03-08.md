R&D designs the Core Set (currently in its *[Ninth Edition](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/expansion/9e)*) both as a learning tool for new **Magic** players and as a source of staple cards for both Constructed formats and casual play. But since it's packed with spells hailing from Alpha through (in the case of *Ninth*) *Betrayers of Kamigawa*, it's also a 350-card tour through the game's past. Take a look below at the art of some *Ninth Edition* cards (in no particular order), and enjoy a planeswalkers'-eye view of events in **Magic**'s history.

No doubt the Core Set's *Tenth Edition* will showcase even more of the history of the **Magic** multiverse.
