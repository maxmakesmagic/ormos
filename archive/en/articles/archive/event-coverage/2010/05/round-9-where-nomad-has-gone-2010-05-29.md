### Dominic Konieczny vs. Guillaume Matignon (Draft)

The battle of the undefeated players was on. Guillaume Matignon of France would play against Dominic Konieczny of Poland. Both players are 8-0 after yesterday's five rounds of Zendikar Block Constructed and three rounds of Rise of the Eldrazi draft. Who would emerge as the victor and start Saturday as they ended Fridayâ€”undefeated?

### Game 1

Both players kept their opening seven-card hands. Guillaume's opening play of [Bloodthrone Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire) seemed for the moment to be slightly outclassed by Dominic's [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) and [Champion's Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion%27s+Drake). That was, until Guillaume cast an [Awakening Zone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening+Zone) the following turn. Guillaume prompty reached into his bag and pulled out a fist full of Eldrazi Spawn. Hmm ... I wonder where this was headed. Dominic brought Guillaume down to 15 while he could, as the battlefield would soon be cluttered with 0/1s. Dominic added [Makindi Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makindi+Griffin) in an attempt to continue his assault by air. Guillaume increased his spawn count with [Kozilek's Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator). His spawn count was now at 3 making the Vampire a potential 7/7. The Vampire went in unblocked sending Dominic to 19. Dominic counterattacked with his team of [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker), [Champion's Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion%27s+Drake) and [Makindi Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makindi+Griffin). [Puncturing Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puncturing+Light) took care of the Predator that jumped in front of [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) and Guillaume fell to 12. [Hedron-Field Purists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron-Field+Purists) hit the table for Dominic post combat. Guillaume spawned a fourth Spawn courtesy of [Awakening Zone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening+Zone), then two more thanks to [Dread Drone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Drone).

The Spawn count was at six, and [Bloodthrone Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire) started looking a little scary. Guillaume attacked with the vampire but Dominic didn't feel it was time to start blocking yet. Guillaume had no effects and Dominic took 1, leaving him at a healthy 18. Dominic still had two flyers that would soar over the sea of Eldrazi Spawn dropping Guillaume to 9 life. [Wall of Omens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens) provided an extra card and a potential chump blocker if [Bloodthrone Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire) threatened a lethal attack. Dominic's remaining mana was used to level the Purists to level 1. [Last Kiss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Kiss) from Guillaume got rid of the [Champion's Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion%27s+Drake), bringing his life total up to 11, but had little else aside from casting a second [Awakening Zone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening+Zone).

An attack from [Makindi Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makindi+Griffin) returned Guillaume to 9 life, and Dominic followed this up with [Nomads' Assembly](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomads%27+Assembly) putting four Kor Soldier tokens onto battlefield and potentially seven more next turn if the board positions stayed as they were. Guillaume created two more Spawn tokens from the [Awakening Zone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening+Zone)s, bringing the Spawn count up to eight. Now this [Bloodthrone Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire) was a must-block. The vampire entered the red zone and was blocked by [Wall of Omens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens). After some thought Guillaume decided to sacrifice two Spawn to destroy the Wall in combat. The remaining six Spawn, along with five land, were used to play [Pathrazer of Ulamog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pathrazer+of+Ulamog). [Nomads' Assembly](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomads%27+Assembly) rebounded to create seven more Kor Soldiers. Dominic looked to have plenty of creatures to block the giant Eldrazi for quite awhile, but when Dominic used [Smite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smite) on the Pathrazer's first attack, Guillaume had decided it was time for the next game.

Dominic Konieczny 1, Guillaume Matignon 0

### Game 2

Guillaume cast a [Nest Invader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) on turn two. Unfortunately he didn't play any other lands or spells this game. Dominic took advantage of his stymied opponent with two [Knight of Cliffhaven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Cliffhaven) on the second and third turns. After Dominic leveled both Knights to level 1, Guillaume extended his hand. Dominic moves on as the sole undefeated player in San Juan at 9-0.
