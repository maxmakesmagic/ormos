Both players started blisteringly fast with creatures on their very first turns: Jonsson cast [Elite Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard), Abe [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). Jonnson had [Infantry Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran) next, while Abe accelerated into [Cloud Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Elemental). Jonsson cast [Excommunicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Excommunicate) on the Elves and Abe had to replay them.


Now both players summoned one [Water Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Water+Servant) each. Jonsson returned the Servant with another [Excommunicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Excommunicate) and attacked with his own. He pumped his Servant, just to have it bounced by [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon). Abe replayed it, Jonsson however tapped four mana and played one of the two cards in his hand...


"Oh no, I played the wrong card!" Jonsson exclaimed, as he looked at his [Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane) in shocked surprise. He agonized over his options and just gained 2 with Ajani's first ability. "That was so terrible. I just picked the wrong card." With the [Water Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Water+Servant) still in his hand, the Swede couldn't even protect his Planeswalker from Abe's attacking [Cloud Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Elemental), [Water Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Water+Servant), and [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). He blocked the latter with his [Elite Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard) and chumped the Servant with [Infantry Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran). Postcombat Abe summoned [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider). Jonsson finally cast that [Water Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Water+Servant), and used [Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane) to put a counter on it.

He was still shaking his head about the accidental misplay, when Abe had a second [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) to take the game.

In the second game neither player had anything for the first two turns, and on turn three Jonsson only cast the lowly [Infantry Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran). His next turn, however increased the pressure considerably, with another [Infantry Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran) as well as [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) to bounce Abe's first creature, [Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief).


Abe replaced it with [Water Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Water+Servant), while Jonsson cast [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) and attacked for 4.


Abe summoned [Spined Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Wurm), but Jonsson had [Excommunicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Excommunicate) at the ready, and [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) when the Wurm tried for a comeback. Meanwhile, [Water Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Water+Servant) went on a little offense himself, so Abe was left without blockers when Jonsson cast [Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane). All of Jonsson's creatures, one [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) and two [Infantry Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran)s, turned into 3/3s, the latter by virtue of, for once, using their own tap ability on themselves.


**Allison Abe 1 – 1 Anton Jonsson**

"Uh. Nice curve," was the first contribution Abe could make in the third game. Jonsson had just cast [Elite Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard) on turn one and followed it up with [Stormfront Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus), while Abe passed his third turn without even as much as a land drop. He did have an [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) and topdecked [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) to slow things down a little. But by then the Elves already had to block [Elite Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard), and Jonsson's beatdown didn't miss a beat with [Cloud Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Elemental).


The Elemental received an [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) as well, but was recast along with a brand-new [Infantry Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran). Things turned from bad to desolate for Abe: One look at [Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane) was enough and he offered his hand in concession.
