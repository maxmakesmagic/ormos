Sometimes art descriptions are subtle. They direct the artist to put certain figures in the background and to achieve a particular ephemeral mood.

Other times, it's a little more direct: 


> Color: Red spell  
>  Location: forest  
>  Action: Two elves try unsuccessfully to restrain a third elf who has gone stark-raving mad. The mad elf's eyes glow red-orange as though he's possessed. He's not frothing at the mouth . . . yet.  
>  Focus: the elf made berserk by red magic  
>  Mood: Insanely angry for no reason

Dan Scott received this art description and turned in this sketch:
