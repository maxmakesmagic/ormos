**UPDATE 9/2/2015:** We've listened to player feedback and have decided to extend the [2-Player Legacy Cube queue](#legacycube) through Saturday, September 5!

Rise of the Eldrazi Flashback Drafts
====================================


When we last left Zendikar, the Eldrazi were rising up to take it over. Re-familiarize yourself with the setting and celebrate the upcoming release of *Battle for Zendikar* by doing a flashback *Rise of the Eldrazi* draft. There will be a lot of celebration for the new set at PAX Prime, and this is an opportunity to join in the celebration from home! These events will run from the August 26 downtime through the September 9 downtime, and will use the 6-2-2-2 Swiss structure to allow you to enjoy one of *Magic*'s most popular Draft formats. Details for the event are at the [bottom](#roeswiss) of this article.

Legacy Cube Sealed Queue
========================


The [*Magic Online* Championship Series](http://magic.wizards.com/en/2015-magic-online-championship-series) is currently in Season 9, where people are qualifying for prelims and finals that are Legacy Cube Sealed! The qualifying season began with the July 29 downtime and is in progress now through the August 26 downtime.


But how can you test for these prelims or finals events? Or what if you just want to try out some Cube Sealed, even if you aren't qualified? I'm glad you asked! Starting with the August 26 downtime and lasting through the September 2 downtime (after which the prelims begin), we'll be running a 2-player Phantom Sealed queue for the Legacy Cube! Do a Sealed Deck build and then play a match against your opponent's deck for only 3 event tickets. And win some prizes, of course. Full details are the [bottom](#legacycube) of this article.


Note: The card list will be identical to the last time Legacy Cube drafts were run on *Magic Online*. You can see the complete card list [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/legacy-cube-cardlist-2015-03-02). Also, in Cube Sealed events, players may have a card more than once and a card may appear both in your pool as well as your opponent’s. This will be true both for the 2-player queues as well as the *Magic Online* Championship Series Prelims and Finals.

Deck Building Time Adjustment for 8-4 Single Elimination Draft
==============================================================


The current deck building time in drafts (10 minutes) is a holdover from the previous client, which, unlike the current client, did not allow you to construct your deck while in the middle of the draft. We believe that, as a result, players are often sitting around for longer than needed waiting for Round 1 to start. So we are looking at lowering the time for deck building in drafts.


We want to test this out slowly, however, so we're starting with the 8-4 Single Elimination drafts, where the most experienced drafters play, and lowering the deck building time from 10 minutes to 5 minutes to see how this affects things as well as how players react to the change. This change will occur starting with the August 26 downtime.


If you have any feedback on these changes or other issues related to *Magic Online* events, please do not hesitate to reach out to [@MagicOnline](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline), or [@mtg\_lee](https://twitter.com/mtg_lee) on Twitter, or to [magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com](mailto:magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com). Thanks!
