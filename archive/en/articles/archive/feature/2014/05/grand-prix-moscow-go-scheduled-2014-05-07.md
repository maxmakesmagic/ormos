We have received a number of questions from players asking about [Grand Prix Moscow](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/grandprix/moscow14), June 13–15, in light of the recent political situation in the region. 

This event will be going ahead as scheduled—for players planning on attending who have any concerns we advise that you check the recommendation of the relevant government department in your country before making travel arrangements.


**Magic** is thriving in Russia and Eastern Europe, as in the rest of Europe, and we will continue to support the region with events in future.
