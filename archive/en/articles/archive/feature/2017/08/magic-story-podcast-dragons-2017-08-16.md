This week we're on to the most iconic of *Commander (2017 Edition)* tribes, Dragons. We've already previewed all the cards from C17, so the gloves are off.


Also, since people requested it, our good friend and community member Cary Thomas ([@Vronos](https://twitter.com/Vronos)) took it upon themself to transcribe the episode, which [you can read here](https://vronos.com/magic-story-podcast-transcripts/magic-story-podcast-dragons/). Of course, then you're missing out on the dulcet tones of our voices, but, hey, you do you.
