I hope you enjoyed [Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk) last weekend from Hawaii. It was an exciting event that I was honored to cover from the booth, feature match area, and news desk. We learned a lot about the new format, but also learned that the final opinions haven't settled yet on this complex new set.


Now that we have crowned a champion there (congratulations to Ari Lax) it's time we turned our focus back to getting you better at Limited. After all, that is the main goal of this column. It's my belief that *Magic* is more fun when you are winning. Some people prioritize it over almost everything else (myself included), but even if winning isn't at the top of your list, it's bound to be close to it.

This is why I do my best to equip you with the tools needed to outbuild, outthink, and outplay your opposition whenever I can.


This week, though, we are going to look at our little *Magic* universe from a different paradigm. It's Multiplayer Week here on DailyMTG.com, and we are going to hone in on what I think is the best way to play multiplayer Limited.


Before we do, though, I feel it's appropriate that I issue a bit of a disclaimer: I don't like multiplayer *Magic* very much.


I know. It's kind of curmudgeonly and perhaps a bit overly Spiky of me to only focus on duels, but that's where I find the most intrigue in this game. Look, I know multiplayer games can be really fun. I've had fun playing them before. But usually I don't, and the reason is pretty simple when you look at it from a wider perspective.


Let's say you have four players playing in a free-for-all game of multiplayer Sealed Deck (free-for-all meaning every player for themselves). On the surface, this sounds pretty sweet. There can be only one champion, you get to adjust your deck building in interesting ways (preparing for a longer game, playing bigger and more game-swinging spells, etc.), and of course the game play itself can be fascinating.


Which is where we run into the two major snags of multiplayer games like this:



1. **Politics**
Once you get to this point, politics play the single biggest factor in who wins the game. I would prefer that the person who built the best deck and played the best won. But instead, at any given time, two or more players can simply decide (for any reason whatsoever) that they want to take out a player. And it's nearly impossible for that player to retaliate.


Politics *can* be interesting. It's not that there isn't any value there; it's just that it's too big of a factor in the game for my liking.
2. **Lack of Incentives**
I like attacking. In fact, my first instinct in all board states is to attack like a madman until my opponent is dead. It's an exercise in restraint for me to not just go into full red zone mode at all times.


In a multiplayer game like the one described, you are actively incentivized to *not* attack, unless you are dealing the final damage to an opponent. And even then it's often bad for you to attack!


The reasoning is simple: If I am the one to attack an opponent, I am now open to being attacked back by not only that opponent, but two other opponents as well!


Why bother attacking at all?


Once you take the incentive to attack away, the game slips into a long slog of players not really doing much. Not my idea of a fun, interactive game of *Magic*.

What's the Solution?
====================


My take on multiplayer games like this is partly logical (as outlined above), and partly my own personal preference. But regardless of the reason for my thinking that way, it did have me looking for better options.


And I found some.


To be honest, I was presented with one and found the other.


The first one was  [*Conspiracy*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/conspiracy) , which under most circumstances is played exactly as described above: four players, free-for-all style. You'd think I'd be miserable, but I wasn't. In fact, I have played *Conspiracy* multiple times since its release, and have enjoyed every time.


So what gives?


First, it's Draft. I love to draft and *Conspiracy* was designed to be drafted like no other set before it. I mean, there are literally cards that say, "When you draft this card" [all over the place in that set](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=[%22Magic:%20The%20Gathering%E2%80%94Conspiracy%22]). I'm pretty sure I'd sit down and draft it just for the sake of drafting it, without even playing the matches.


Second, they *designed* the cards to be played in a multiplayer fashion. There are game breakers, cards that incentivize attacks (see: [dethrone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5bdethrone])), and they even just owned the whole politics thing by making a bunch of cards that you just outright vote on.


But most sets aren't designed with this style of gameplay in mind. So what is one to do when one finds oneself with three friends and a bunch of booster packs just aching to be opened?


Pair up, and get your Two-Headed Giant on, that's what.


Two-Headed Giant
================


Often forgotten, [Two-Headed Giant](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/twoheadedgiant) is an official, competitive format in every sense. Heck, there was even a [Two-Headed Giant Pro Tour](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/sandiego07)! It's the real deal, it's multiplayer, and it doesn't suffer from any of the issues outlined above.


If you haven't played Two-Headed Giant before, I highly recommend it.


You can do it as a Booster Draft if you have eight players, or you can do the more traditional Sealed Deck version where you open eight packs with your teammate and build two decks from those cards.


The basics of Two-Headed Giant are this:



* Each team is composed of two players (the "heads").
* The players share a life total, which starts at 30 instead of the normal 20.
* All other resources (besides life total) are not shared by the two players (cards in hand, mana, etc.).
* Players take their team's turn and phases together.
* Players are allowed to talk, strategize, and help each other throughout the match.
* Matches are played as one game.

You can read the full [FAQ for Two-Headed-Giant](http://www.wizards.com/ContentResources/Wizards/WPN/Main/Documents/Magic_The_Gathering_TwoHeaded_Giant_Tournament_FAQ_PDF1.pdf) if you want more information on the format.


In the end, you get virtually none of the hang-ups I have with multiplayer, but instead you get a fantastic multiplayer experience. Helping out a teammate and having someone right there to check your work are both great feelings. You are incentivized to attack whenever it makes sense, and politics are a nonissue.


You also get the super cool benefit of rethinking the way you build your decks. Often, you'll see one deck be the aggressor, while the other deck is the support deck. One can present a curve of threats while the other controls the board or even uses pump spells on the other head's creatures. Or both players can be on the same plan, just with different colors. There are many options.


Additionally, Two-Headed Giant forces you to reevaluate individual cards. Cards that say "each opponent" take on a whole new light in Two-Headed Giant. Since each "head" counts as an opponent, you effectively get double the effect from those spells.

Cards like these turn into legitimate win conditions or even bombs (in the case of [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom)) in Two-Headed Giant. It really does force you to rethink every card in the set. In general, evasive creatures are excellent, as well as removal that just kills any creature dead. Even if it's more expensive than you'd like to pay, it's worth it since your opponents will have eight booster packs of rares to find some nice bombs with.


While bombs are great as always, they tend to die a bit more often in Two-Headed Giant, as they have to fight through two hands' worth of removal. Still, you always play them; if they do survive they are every bit as powerful as ever.


Many Games
==========


I've heard it said many times, and this article shows it once again: *Magic* isn't just one game, it's many games under one big umbrella. Even if regular multiplayer isn't my favorite way to play the game, there are always other options for someone like me who wants to battle. My advice is to be open-minded about playing in different ways, and when you find something you like, stick with it.


Until next week!
