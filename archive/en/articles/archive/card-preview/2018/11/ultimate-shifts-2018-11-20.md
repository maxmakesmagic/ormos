Not too long ago, I [wrote about one of my favorite decks](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/decks-wotcstaff-2018-10-09), my (nearly) all foil [Azami, Lady of Scrolls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azami%2C+Lady+of+Scrolls) Commander deck. The story I didn't share there was the difficulty I had finding two key foils—[Laboratory Maniac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laboratory+Maniac) and, somewhat ironically, [Foil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foil).


[Laboratory Maniac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laboratory+Maniac) I ended up finding in a pile of old *Innistrad* cards I had forgotten existed, but [Foil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foil) was printed during the multi-year period where I took my one and only break from *Magic*, and it had not ever been reprinted in foil. Uncommon foils from *Prophecy* just weren't all that, well, common.


I did, eventually, find one, but that job would have been much easier if, say, it had been printed as a common in a *Masters* set. Like, say, *Ultimate Masters*.


![Foil](https://media.wizards.com/2018/uma/en_wo1wBJOnIQ.png)


That's right, foil [Foil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foil) lovers and Pauper players, [Foil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foil) is back, *and it's common*.


In fact, *Ultimate Masters* is just lousy with cards downshifted for people like me. In fact, for people *exactly* like me.


![Laboratory Maniac](https://media.wizards.com/2018/uma/en_NgDN6uuBO2.png)


Yup, that's an uncommon. But why stop there?


[Living Lore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Lore) lacked the love of players, but maybe they'll understand it as an uncommon?

[Firewing Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firewing+Phoenix) and [Magmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magmaw) both served their purposes in Limited, but when the set is juiced up, some Limited rare bombs can stand to become Limited uncommon bombs.

Similarly, [Hero of Leina Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Leina+Tower) was a payoff card for heroic decks back in *Theros* block, but can you imagine getting more than one of these? I'll do you one better, can you imagine having more than one of these and then casting *Travel Preparations*?


![Hero of Leina Tower](https://media.wizards.com/2018/uma/en_2AYr9wu20s.png)![Travel Preparations](https://media.wizards.com/2018/uma/en_bqWTdJIH5w.png)


"Sure," you say, "those are cool and all, but [Foil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foil) whetted my appetite for some Pauper additions. That card seems absurd in the format. Surely that's not all you've got."


Surely not.


![Tethmos High Priest](https://media.wizards.com/2018/uma/en_3shCbJPguT.png)![Miming Slime](https://media.wizards.com/2018/uma/en_v7gWKxjscT.png)![Slum Reaper](https://media.wizards.com/2018/uma/en_uE7MJuLvtO.png)


![Dimir Guildmage](https://media.wizards.com/2018/uma/en_ZzuLPZypIn.png)


They probably won't bend the format on their ear like [Foil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foil) will (or foil [Foil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foil)s, if you're fancy), but getting this many new toys all at once has surely got to shake things up.


And even if it somehow doesn't, it will be enjoyable giggling a little bit every time you crack a foil [Foil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foil), now very much easier to find.
