When a plane is an unbroken urban landscape, what sense do terms like "forest" and "island" have there?


To help answer that question, this week in Magic Arcana we'll look at samples of the amazing basic land art from *Ravnica: City of Guilds*. Today we look at [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island).

That's okay, go ahead and wipe the drool. You'll get your own in *Ravnica* tournament packs at the [prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/prereleases), September 24-25.
