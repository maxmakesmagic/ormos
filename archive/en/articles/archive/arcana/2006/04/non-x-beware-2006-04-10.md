[![Rakdos the Defiler](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1052_rakdosquote.jpg)](/en/articles/archive/dissension-ranks-2006-04-10)D*issension's* 
 **Rakdos the Defiler** (previewed in [today's feature article](/en/articles/archive/dissension-ranks-2006-04-10) by Rei Nakazawa) causes players to sacrifice "non-Demon" permanents. While references to "[Goblin Taskmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Goblin%2BTaskmaster)" and "[Gempalm Strider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Gempalm%2BStrider)" and "[Takeno, Samurai General](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Takeno%252C%2BSamurai%2BGeneral)" have been relatively common in **Magic**, use of the "non-" prefix, specifying everything that *isn't* a member of a subtype, has been much rarer. 

Most of the references to "non-" are on older cards that specified "non-Wall creatures" before the defender keyword was created to mean "this creature can't attack." [Nettling Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettling+Imp), [Siren's Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren%27s+Call) and [Aggression](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aggression) gain some flavor by specifying "non-Wall" -- it wouldn't do to have your [Wall of Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Stone) die because it couldn't heed the [Norritt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norritt) or got in a fight with a [Basilisk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk), right? 

![Catacomb Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Catacomb+Dragon)*Mirage's* 
[Catacomb Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Dragon) is a cool early example of a card that specifies "non-Dragons" -- anything that gets in a tussle with it that isn't a dragon or artifact creature gets so freaked out that its power is cut in half.![Frontline Strategist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Frontline+Strategist)*Onslaught* Block's heavy emphasis on tribal interactions, especially combined with Black's selfish fifth of the color pie, led to several instances of the exclusionary "non-". [Cruel Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival), [Deathmark Prelate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark+Prelate), [Noxious Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Ghoul), and [Call to the Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+the+Grave) all punish non-Zombies. However, also see [Frontline Strategist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frontline+Strategist), which "[Fog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)s" all non-Soldiers for battlefield victory.![Harbinger of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Harbinger+of+Spring)**Rakdos the Defiler** is the only card that refers to "non-Demons", but Kamigawa Block has its share of tribally-aware demons and spirits. When [Yukora the Prisoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yukora+the+Prisoner) dies, he takes all your non-Ogres with him. [Harbinger of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbinger+of+Spring) has protection from non-Spirits, and [Rend Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rend+Flesh) rends, well, any fleshy creatures, i.e. non-Spirits.Most recently, the introduction of the Aura subtype to replace "local enchantments" has caused Oracle rewording of the term "global". For example, [Opalescence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opalescence) and [Tranquil Domain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tranquil+Domain) now refer to "non-Aura enchantments". But we suggest, when you head to the [prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases), that you keep track of non-Demons first...
