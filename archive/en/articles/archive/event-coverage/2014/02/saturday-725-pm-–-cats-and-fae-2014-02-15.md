At next weekend's Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* in Valencia, [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) and [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) are poised to make a big comeback to the Modern stage. The format this weekend may be Legacy, but Faerie tokens as well as one very special Cat have still made an appearance in the feature match area here in Paris.


Grand Prix champions Florian Koch and Wenzel Krautmann, for example, were both running a copy of [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) in the main deck of their BURG Delver. As Koch explained, "in Legacy, players will oftentimes trade off all of their business spells; there's so much disruption flying about, and when the smoke clears the Faeries simply take over." He particularly stressed its usefulness against Miracles, saying, "Of course they can buy time with a couple of [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) and hope to resolve a big [Entreat the Angels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) eventually, but realistically they just can't beat [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom)." Wenzel Krautmann chimed in to agree: "In all of my matches so far the card really was great. More people should play it."

Meanwhile, Thomas Enevoldsen found, in [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos), a new addition for his beloved Death and Taxes. He already used that deck to win the last European Legacy Grand Prix and, at the time of writing, was sitting somewhat comfortably at 6-1. 1/1 creature tokens, whether Faerie Rogues or Cat Soldiers, are apparently all the rage nowadays.


Another *Born of the Gods* card, while missing from Enevoldsen's deck, found its way into many other Death and Taxes lists. In a format where [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), and [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) seem to be everywhere, [Spirit of the Labyrinth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+of+the+Labyrinth) can be quite the beating, especially when it ambushes unsuspecting opponent's via [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial). Two-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor Manuel Mayer was full of praise for the Spirit. "And I only managed the Vial ambush once, but still I wouldn't want to miss the card," Mayer pointed out. He too was 6-1 playing the white-weenie strategy.


Sometimes, developments in Legacy come about rather fast—the adoption of [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) or [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) are recent examples—but usually the format with its long history of well-established archetypes moves quite slowly, and change is gradual and often comes in the form of minor tweaks, a few cards added here, a little innovation there. Faeries, Cats, and Spirits clearly are an example of the second kind of development.
