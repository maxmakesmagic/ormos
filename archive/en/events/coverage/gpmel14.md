TOP 8 COVERAGE
--------------


 The Gods have spoken and Nam Sung-Wook is your Grand Prix Melbourne 2014 Champion!Defeating local hero Patty Robertson in the finals, Nam also makes history by becoming the first South Korean player to win a Grand Prix. To make this moment even more special, his victory comes from ousting over 900 other players in Australia's largest ever tournament. 

Semifinalists Wei Yifan and Ash Webster have also tried their best to defend the trophy and they should not be disappointed to return home with a hefty prize check, along with airfare and a much-coveted invitation to Pro Tour Journey into Nyx. 

Rounding off the rest of the top 8 include four-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor Huang Hao-Shan from Taiwan, Pro Tour Born of the Gods Top 16 competitor Zheng Jingwei as well as Luke McGlaughlin and Craig Chapman. Congratulations to all, and may the Gods be with you!

DAY 1 COVERAGE
--------------


The Gods have spoken.


Thassa, God of the Sea is making waves in the new Blue Devotion archetype that splashes white for newfound friend Ephara, God of the Polis and Detention Sphere. Newly immortalized Xenagos, God of Revels is wrecking havoc, granting his monstrous minions haste and "double strike". Erebos, God of the Dead continues to be backbreaking in the Mono-Black Devotion mirror match, switching off opposing Gray Merchant of Asphodels and even Heliod, God of the Suns and Purphoros, God of the Hammer have also made appearances.


Grand Prix Melbourne is quite literally "*Born of the Gods*". 


Day One of the largest Grand Prix in Australia has come to an end and only a 128 hopefuls remain. James Fazzolari and Wei Yifan are at the perfect 9-0 record, while Nam Sung-wook is at 8-0-1. Some notable players hot on their heels include Zheng Jingwei, Luke Mulcahy, Huang Hao-Shan, Roger Matthew, Wilfy Horig and Joe Soh, all at 8-1 records. Current Australian Pro Point leader Justin Cheung has also managed the cut, along with three-time Pro Tour Top 8 competitor Terry Soh and ex-National Champions Adam Witton and Rick Lee.


With so much talent in the pool, be back tomorrow as we deliver to you the latest updates from the source, along with live streaming video coverage! Stay tuned!
