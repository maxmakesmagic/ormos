The curtain has closed on [Pro Tour–Berlin](/en/node/502416), but that doesn't mean the analysis is over. ELVES! dominated the Top 8, but how did it do matchup by matchup? Is there a deck the little green men should fear? Paul Jordan crunched the numbers for all the major archetypes. If you're looking for the hard numbers on what beat what, you won't want to miss it.

But what about those elves? Luis Scott-Vargas looked like an underdog on paper in each of his Top 8 matches, but that didn't keep him from collecting the champion's trophy and giant check. Listen in to Rich Hagon's podcast recap of Berlin as he interviews Scott-Vargas just minutes after the last card had been played. Along with the winner's interview, Hagon traces the full story from Berlin across all three days.

If you want the full story, sit back and check out the [complete Top 8 videos](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/webcast/home) for as much elf-on-elf action as you can handle.
