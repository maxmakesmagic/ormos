Travel bookings must be finalized no later than 30 days before the first date of travel to the Pro Tour. Any travel not issued and finalized prior to this date will be forfeit.
**Please note:**   
**The PTQ travel award is for airfare only** and does not include baggage fees or hotel accommodations. All hotel accommodations are the sole responsibility of the player. If you live within driving distance of the Pro Tour, you may be eligible for a Local Travel Award. Please include this information when you send in your documents. 

**Visa Requirements:** It is the player's responsibility to determine if a travel visa is required. Please be aware that visas usually take several weeks to process. 

**If you are under 18 years of age:** Minors who win a Qualifier are not eligible for the plane ticket travel award. Instead, minors will be issued a cash equivalent award equal to the cost of a round trip ticket to the Pro Tour, as determined by Wizards in its sole discretion. This award will be issued only if the player turns in documentation described above, attends the Pro Tour, and registers to play. The cash equivalent award is processed after the Pro Tour.

If a tournament official incorrectly or improperly distributes this letter for any reason, Wizards of the Coast and the DCI reserves the right to withhold any and all invitations and prizes for this event. Invitations may be rescinded by the DCI upon investigation.
