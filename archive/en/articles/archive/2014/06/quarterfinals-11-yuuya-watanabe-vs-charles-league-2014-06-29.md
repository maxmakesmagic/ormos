 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






As one of the most prestigious players in modern *Magic*, 11th-ranked Yuuya Watanabe has won Grand Prix the world over. With recent top finishes and success in Nagoya and Bejing, and almost two dozen more across the years, Watanabe is known as a Grand Prix competitor. He has seven wins to his name already, and without a doubt he was eager to add an eighth.


Charles League, a streamer on Twitch as Flekov, didn't carry the same history as his opponent. While a first Grand Prix Top 8 isn't often the most successful for a player, history is full of surprises. *Magic* is a game where anything can happen, and League had already laid the groundwork of an underdog tale by ending the second draft with a 3-0 record.


World travelers and top pros lose all the time, after all. The standings outside the Top 8 were filled with players like that.


**The Games**


Watanabe's early [Brain Maggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Maggot) took League's [Fleetfeather Cockatrice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleetfeather+Cockatrice) from hand, and Watanabe assembled a controlling board position behind [Shipwreck Singer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipwreck+Singer). [Triton Tactics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Tactics) from League helped slow the steady march of Watanabe's [Marshmist Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marshmist+Titan) and a flying friend, but there weren't enough creatures with enough toughness on League's side to hold out forever.

*Charles League was whittled down from a persistent [Shipwreck Singer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipwreck+Singer) and Marsh Titan.* 

**League 0 – Watanabe 1**



The second game started fast for the Japanese star: [Nyxborn Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Eidolon) bestowed with [Spiteful Returned](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiteful+Returned), letting Watanabe take 5 life point chunks out of League's total. [Shipwreck Singer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipwreck+Singer) joined the fray, and League quickly fell to just 2 life with only [Voyaging Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr) and a hand – not battlefield – full of creatures to work with. [Brain Maggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Maggot) revealed that horde to Watanabe, including Disciple of Nylea. While Watanabe left the life gain in League's hand, after it was cast on League's turn Watanabe revealed the [Cast into Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cast+into+Darkness) waiting to keep the path clear.

*Yuuya Watanabe came out with an aggressive start, overwhelming Charles League quickly.*

It's an unfortunate end but sometimes that's how *Magic* works out too.



**League 0 – Watanabe 2**
