 There are always a lot of fun things to do on Friday at the Grand Prix site. Yesterday in Los Angeles, there were Last-Chance Trials, a "Foiled Again!" tournament with cool prizes, and more. One of the events was a Standard seminar held by none other than No. 9 William Jensen and No. 13 Josh Utter-Leyton.
