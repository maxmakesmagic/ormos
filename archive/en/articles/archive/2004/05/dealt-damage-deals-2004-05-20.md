One of the little clues that a card has a triggered ability is when the rules text begins with "Whenever". We've run a few searches and estimate that over 750 cards begin with that **Magic** word. However, of those, there have only been 17 that use the trigger: Whenever X is dealt damage. The most popular first appearance of this trigger was on the *Alpha* [Fungusaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Fungusaur) which says... "Each time Fungusaur is damaged but not destroyed, put a +1/+1 counter on it."


*Fifth Dawn* adds another similar trigger as today's preview card **Rite of Passage** (featured in Mark Gottlieb's article "[It Can't Be Wrong If It Feels So Rite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mg124)") shares this rare Fungusaur-like ability.


As a tribute to all of the cards that react to being dealt damage, today's Arcana presents:


**Whenever *It* Is Dealt Damage!**
