Did you go to the ***Magic** 2012* prerelease? Was it fun? Great! You know, the [Launch Parties](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/release-facts) are this weekend. Unless you're reading this more than a week after it was posted. In which case, did you go to the ***Magic** 2012* Launch Parties on July 15-18? Was it fun?

Okay, never mind all that. It was supposed to smoothly segue into showing off the ***Magic** 2012* token cards, but it kind of got away from me. Let's just look at tokens!

This Bird token is officially created by [Roc Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roc+Egg), but you can use it for any 3/3 bird. We won't stop you!

If you're looking for a soldier, you probably want [Throne of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Empires) or [Timely Reinforcements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Reinforcements).

Zombies are well-represented among ***Magic** 2012* token generators. [Cemetery Reaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cemetery+Reaper), [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), and [Zombie Infestation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation) are all prepared to zombie it up for you.

Beasts! They're created by [Garruk, Primal Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Primal+Hunter)! Yeah!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/752_5.jpg)  
Saprolings can be found hanging out with [Jade Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jade+Mage) or buried in a [Druidic Satchel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Druidic+Satchel).

Wurms!! They're created by [Garruk, Primal Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Primal+Hunter)! Yeah!

As far as I'm aware, the only way to get a Pentavite is to use [Pentavus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus). Although technically [Volrath's Laboratory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath%27s+Laboratory) can make a 2/2 Pentavite token, so there's probably something else out there.
