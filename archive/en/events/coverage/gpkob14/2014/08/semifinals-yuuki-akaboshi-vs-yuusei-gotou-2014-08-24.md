Before the match began, the players got a chance to look at each other's decklists: Yuuki Akaboshi claimed that his R/G Tron deck was "completely normal." It was true, there was nothing out of the ordinary in newcomer Yuuki Akaboshi's list. He did not require his deck to be flashy to go 13-2 in the swiss and lock up his first Grand Prix top eight.



 His opponent, Yuusei Gotou, on the other hand, had an anything but ordinary Affinity list. Dubbed "No Affinty" for including zero cards with "Affinity" written on them, he has been able to use burn spells such as [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) and [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) to take opponents out from nowhere all weekend long. In addition to the burn spells, he has [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Ensoul Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensoul+Artifact) in the place of more traditional Affinity creatures giving him protection from many of the standard anti-Affinity cards.



The Games



 Play started with a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) from Gotou which revealed a hand of [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm), two Urza's Towers, Urza's Mine, [Ancient Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Stirrings), [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), and [Expedition Map](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map) from Akaboshi.





*Yuuki Akaboshi*




  
"Whew, you don't have all three [tron pieces]," Gotou quipped



 "But I do have that," Akaboshi mentioned, pointing to [Expedition Map](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map).




 It was therefore no surprise that Gotou tossed the [Expedition Map](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map) into Akaboshi's graveyard.




 Gotou then cast [Ensoul Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensoul+Artifact) on his [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) and attacked for 5.




 Akaboshi was able to find a Karn off of his Ancient Stirrings, but was still left without access to an Urza's Tower. After a few more attacks with [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal), Gotou finished Akaboshi off with [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast).




**Gotou 1-0 Akaboshi**



"That was so quick!" Akaboshi exclaimed.



 While the first game ended with a [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast), the second one started with one: Gotou cast it at the end of Akaboshi's second turn looking to deal four damage. Akaboshi revealed that he had a [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge), destroying Gotou's [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) and turning off Metalcraft.




 Gotou had an [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) of his own and used it to stifle Akaboshi's hopes at forming Urzatron by destroying [Expedition Map](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map).




 "*Magic* is difficult, eh?" Gotou mentioned as he decided to cast an [Ensoul Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensoul+Artifact) on his [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star). After an attack, Akaboshi fell to 13.





*Yuusei Gotou*




  

 Akaboshi used the other half of his [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) to take out the 5/5 [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star) on the following turn, Gotou then cast a [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) and waited for Akaboshi to destroy the world with the newly minted [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone).




 In response to the [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) activation, Gotou got 5 points in with [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast). On his next turn he used [Ensoul Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensoul+Artifact) on his [Darksteel Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel). This prompted a Nature's Claim on the Enchantment while Akaboshi fell to 5.




 Akaboshi thought for a while at the end of turn. He activated his newly minted [Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin) and found a [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine). Gotou attacked in with a pair of [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus)es dropping Akaboshi to 3, When Akaboshi tapped out at end of turn to use [Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin), Gotou found the opening to cast a lethal [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast).




**Yuusei Gotou defeats Yuuki Akaboshi 2-0**
