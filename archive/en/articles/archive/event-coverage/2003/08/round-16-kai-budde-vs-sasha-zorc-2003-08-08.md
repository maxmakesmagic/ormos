![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a718.jpg)Sasha Zorc is a Croatian player who had a Grand Prix Top 8 back at Milano. He's playing [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), while Budde is running black-blue Reanimator. Both players estimate that they need at least 2-1 to have a chance at Top 8, pending tiebreakers.

### Game 1

Budde mulliganed his opening hand. He played [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) on Zorc's end step, then used [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) on upkeep to get [Nether Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Spirit). [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) searched up [Contamination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contamination), and Zorc conceded right away.

Budde- 1 Zorc- 0

### Game 2

Budde had a first turn [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), and Zorc cast [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) in response to protect his hand. Once [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) resolved, Budde saw [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), Poulluted Delta, two Cloud of Fairies and [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore). [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) was the only spell, and had to go to the graveyard. Budde played [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) on the next turn, discarding two lands. Zorc flashed back the Analysis, and Budde played another [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Zorc's hand contained the two Faeries, [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), two lands, [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor) and [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire)- the Desire went to the graveyard.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a719.jpg)[Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) dealt with [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), and now Zorc was a little short on threats. [Frantic Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search) let him produce a mana and discard two [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb)s, and for lack of any other options, Zorc cycled [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries). Budde played [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), activated [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta), and summoned [Nether Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Spirit). He sacrificed it to flash back [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), getting [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor) out of the way. It seemed that Budde would be able to get the [Contamination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contamination) lock down once again, but after cycling another Faeries, Zorc drew into [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore). It shot down the Spirit when it came back, and attacked for four. On end step, Budde used [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) to get [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), and used it along with flash back to strip Zorc's hand down to one card, and lock him under [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore).

Another [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) set up [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)/[Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume), and put [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) into play. This did give Zorc a [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries) from his graveyard, and it attacked to bring Budde down to six. With the help of four mana, the [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) was even keeping pace with the Saprolings. Things were looking pretty bad for Budde, but he used [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) to take Zorc's dead [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), going down to one. Facing a board he couldn't win from, Zorc had to take his chances, let his [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) die, and hope for the best. He found [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap) with [Frantic Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search), but it merely delayed the inevitable. 

**Final Result:** Budde- 2 Zorc- 0
