Welcome to the first *MTG Arena* Community Spotlight! In this event, we're taking a look at a fan-made format that's different from anything on *MTG Arena*. It's called Gladiator, and if you're looking for an experience full of card variety, interesting choices, and back-and-forth matches, then it's got you covered!


Gladiator was established in mid-2020, and its fans have been playing and growing this format for years with frequent discussion and regular tournaments. There's a lot to enjoy about it, so let's learn more!


Community Spotlight: Gladiator Event
====================================


**Dates**: August 11, 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC)–August 15, 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC)  
**Format**: Gladiator  
**Structure**: Play until event ends  
**Entry**: No cost to enter  
**Rewards**:


* 1 Win: 1 rare individual card reward (ICR)
* 2 Wins: 1 rare ICR

What Is Gladiator?
==================


The rules of Gladiator are:


* Decks must contain no fewer than 100 cards and no sideboards, with a maximum of one copy of each card other than basic lands (similar to the Singleton format), or cards with no deck limit, like [Persistent Petitioners](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persistent+Petitioners).
* Matches are best two-out-of-three (but without sideboarding between games).
* All cards available on *MTG Arena* are legal in their original versions, except for the following banned cards:
	+ [Field of the Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+of+the+Dead)
	+ [Natural Order](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order)
	+ [Nexus of Fate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nexus+of+Fate)
	+ [Oko, Thief of Crowns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oko%2C+Thief+of+Crowns)
	+ [Teferi, Time Raveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Time+Raveler)

An oversized deck with a Singleton limit means you'll need a robust game plan that can adapt to many different circumstances, while the multiple-game matches mean you'll see a lot more of both your own deck and your opponent's deck.


To hear even more about Gladiator directly from the folks who love it, tune into [the Weekly MTG Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) on Thursday, August 11, at 2:30 p.m. PT, or [visit the Gladiator Discord](https://discord.gg/eC4umpWZSt). 


Spotlight Deck Folder
=====================


To show off what's possible in Gladiator, and to give folks who are new to the format a jumping-off point, the Gladiator community has provided some decklists for *MTG Arena* players to try out. Look these up in the client while the event is active!


* **Azorius Control** – SupremePhantom (He/Him)
* **Belzenlok Combo** – JokerBoney (They/Them)

When choosing a deck for the event, or even just while in the Decks tab of the client, scroll to the bottom of your decks collection to find the "Community Spotlight: Gladiator" deck folder. You can submit a deck directly from this folder to the event or copy it to your collection of decks to modify as you see fit.
