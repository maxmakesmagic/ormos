In Duel Decks, the front card of each deck is the only premium card, so that means today we're looking at the white underlayers of [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=380190) and [Vraska the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=380214).
