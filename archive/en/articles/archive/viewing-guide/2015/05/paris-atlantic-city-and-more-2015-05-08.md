This week, you can catch live video coverage of two GPs taking place on two different continents. After that, we've got more of your weekday favorites to check out!

First up is Grand Prix Paris! This event highlights Standard Constructed once again and, as the previous weeks have demonstrated, the metagame shifts little by little with each week it is featured. Will this weekend match the [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) metagame of Grand Prix Toronto, or we'll see a full circle back to Esper Dragons and the control decks of the Pro Tour?



Join Riley Knight, Marijn Lybaert, Simon Görtzen, Steven Leeming, Neil Rigby, and Rich Hagon for two days of Standard coverage on the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic)! It all starts Saturday at 1 p.m. local time (CET)/4 a.m. PT/7 a.m. ET/11 a.m. UTC. Coverage resumes Sunday at 9 a.m. local time (CET)/12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET/7 a.m. UTC.

Also taking place this weekend is Grand Prix Atlantic City, which will highlight *Dragons of Tarkir* for the first time at the Grand Prix level of tournament play! Some of these players have gotten a chance to showcase their Limited knowledge already at the Pro Tour last month, but how have those evaluations changed? What makes a good Sealed Deck? What are the influential Draft archetypes?



Join Marshall Sutcliffe, Jacob Van Lunen, Brian David-Marshall, Rashad Miller, Richard Castle, and Matt Mendoza for two days of live Limited action on the [Magic2 Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic2)! It all starts Saturday at 6 p.m. local time (ET)/3 p.m. PT/10 p.m. UTC\* (Editor's note: times have been adjusted in regards to [this announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/grand-prix-atlantic-city-video-delay-2015-05-08)). Coverage resumes Sunday at 9 a.m. local time (ET)/6 a.m. PT/1 p.m. UTC.

Super Standard League
=====================





| **Standings After Week 2** |
| Paul Cheon | 35 Points |
| Owen Turtenwald | 35 Points |
| Tom Ross | 30 Points |
| Gerry Thompson | 30 Points |
| Andrew Cueno | 10 Points |
| Brian Kibler | 10 Points |
| Brad Nelson | 0 Points |
| Josh Utter-Leyton | 0 Points |



After a weekend of Grand Prix action, the Standard Super League is up next on the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic)! Last weekend, Paul Cheon emerged triumphant among the eight competitors, putting him in the running for top spot. And while Josh Utter-Leyton certainly raised some eyebrows when he cast [Conifer Strider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conifer+Strider) last weekend, it has left him among the lower performers in the league.




Will Utter-Leyton turn things around this week? Will Owen Turtenwald take top spot again, or will Cheon hold on to his winning streak? Join hosts Randy Buehler and Luis Scott-Vargas this Tuesday at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET/1 a.m. UTC to find out!
