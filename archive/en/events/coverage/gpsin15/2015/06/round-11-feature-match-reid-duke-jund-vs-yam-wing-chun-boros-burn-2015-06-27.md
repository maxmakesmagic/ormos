Reid Duke's quest to level up has brought him all the way to Singapore and he finds himself in a decent position to make his twelfth Grand Prix Top 8. It is no secret that Duke's a big fan of Jund and he has sleeved up [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) and [Terminate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) this weekend.


Yam Wing Chun from Hong Kong is the relative unknown and one of the newest members of MTG Mint Card. Aside from a Top 8 appearance at Grand Prix Washington D.C. and a Top 16 finish at Pro Tour Fate Reforged, he also most recently made the Top 8 of the TCG Invitational with his trusty Burn deck.


Game One
========


Duke won the die roll but was forced to go down to six cards.


Yam kept his one-land hand consisting of [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), a single fetchland and five burn spells totaling 15 damage.


Using a basic Swamp to cast [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), Reid discarded Yam's only creature but he topdecked [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) as the replacement.


Duke cracked [Bloodstained Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire) for [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground) to summon [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), a nice speed bump against the little red guy.


Yam failed to draw his second land over the next two turns, and could only suspend 2 [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt)s to knock Duke down to ten.


Counting at least 9 more incoming damage from the cards he already saw, Duke decided he could not afford to play the waiting game and decided to go on the offensive by killing [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and swinging with a 4/5 [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf).

*Yam Wing Chun*


Yam counterattacked with [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), forcing Duke to keep [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) home. When it did block it the next turn, Searing [Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blaze) finished it off, reducing Duke down to 5 life.


[Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike) and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) wrapped things up.

Game Two
========


Duke once again led with [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), taking away [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel).


When Yam recruited both [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) and [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear), they fell to [Disfigure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure) and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) after a couple of hits.


[Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) was the follow up and with Duke at 18 life after cleaning out Yam's graveyard, there was no way he could lose this game.


**Reid Duke 0 – Yam Wing Chun 1**


Game Three
==========


Yam led with [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), revealing [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) from the top of Duke's deck to practically ensure it's death.


However, Yam had a speedier start than that, adding an additional [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) and [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) to the board. Duke could only fetch [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground)s and kill one, going down to 15.

*Reid Duke*


A second [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) dealt with the other [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), and a third [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) offed [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer).


Despite the onslaught, Duke was able to stabilize with cheap solutions and seal the game with [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) with 11 life still in the bank.

**Reid Duke defeats Yam Wing Chun 2-1 and advances to 10-1.**
