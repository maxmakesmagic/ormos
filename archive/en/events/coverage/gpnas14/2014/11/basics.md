 If you're new to the tournament *Magic* scene, or a sporadic spectator, you can be forgiven for not knowing the intricacies of *Magic* Team Sealed tournaments. "But Marc, isn't *Magic* an individual game, with multiplayer formats relegated to the kitchen tables, and coffee tables, and the like?" Why no, invented straw man! Though less common, team tournaments have a long and storied history in the Grand Prix halls. However this format is a touch different than your usual multiplayer, crazy brawl.



Team formats require a team of three players (registered at the beginning of the event, no changing your team halfway through the tournament) to construct three different decks to be played against three opponents simultaneously, in three separate two-out-of-three matches. Each internal match win earns the overall team 1 point. To win the round, the team's players must get at least 2 points of internal matches. 





*Grand Prix Portland Finalists Luis Scott-Vargas, Eric Froehlich, Paul Cheon*
