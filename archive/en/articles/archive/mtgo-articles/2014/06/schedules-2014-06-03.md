Click on each title for event details. Premier Events are displayed in **bold**, and Events in red are available if [this week's downtime](http://community.wizards.com/group/magic-online?qt-group_content_interface=1#qt-group_content_interface) allows. Though we will always try to notify players of any significant changes to the events schedule, **Magic Online** reserves the right to adjust the events schedule without advance notice. When an event that requires 64 players or less fails to meet the minimum number of players, filing for reimbursement is not required as refunds will automatically be fulfilled after the event is cancelled.

As a general rule, **Magic Online** sets will be available for redemption roughly one month after they are released. If a redeemable set runs out of stock before its Redemption Guarantee Date, the set will be reprinted. After a redeemable set's Redemption Guarantee Date has passed, such set will be available while supplies last or until its Redemption Cutoff Date, whichever comes first. All cutoff times are 9:00 AM.


For additional information about redemption, please read our [Redemption Policy](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/984).
