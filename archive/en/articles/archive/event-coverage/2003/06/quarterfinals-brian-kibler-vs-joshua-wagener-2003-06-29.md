![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natus03/a736.jpg)Brian Kibler is an established name on the Pro Tour. Ever since his [Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon)-themed comeback to tournament Magic at Pro Tour: Chicago, Kibler has been a staple on the list of the money finishes. This weekend treated him particularly well. Kibler made it into the Top 8 with three rounds to go, and had the luxury of conceding to his friends Finkel and Reeves to assure their spots in the Top 8, before drawing the last round. All of this manipulation however placed him in the unfortunate position of having to face Josh Wagener in the first round.

Wagener entered the competitive Magic scene with a third place finish in Junior Super Series a few years ago and recently followed it up with a top 8 finish at Grand Prix: Boston. To date, he has never played on the Pro Tour. However, it is Wagener, not Kibler who is a strong favorite in the matchup. Wagener is playing a fairly standard red-green aggro deck. The only major difference is that his version is running [Reckless Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge) over [Elephant Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Guide) – a choice Wagener came to regret throughout the tournament. Still, it is an awesome matchup against Kibler's mono-black Zombies deck. 

### Game 1

Kibler led off with [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), naming a [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) right away. Although Wagener was at least three turns away from being able to cast one, Kibler simply could not afford to name something else as the Centaur is truly a nightmare card for him in the matchup. Therapy missed, and Wagener summoned a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) on the following turn. Kibler removed it with a [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). 

Wagener's next threat was a [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd). Kibler summoned [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch) and used his third land to remove [Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call) from the grave, denying Wagener the ability to flash it back. [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) took out the Zombie Cleric and a second [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) came into play. Stuck on three lands, Kibler had no way to answer these threats. He cast [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and chose a [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption), leaving his opponent with a pair of [Reckless Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge)s in hand. Generally not a card Wagener wants in the matchup, it was perfect in this situation, allowing Wagener to deal damage to Kibler extremely quickly and capitalize fully on the mono-black mage's mana problems. 

Kibler fought back for a few turns, able to block with [Rotlung Reanimator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotlung+Reanimator), then it's Zombie token and a [Stronghold Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stronghold+Assassin) – but his life total was consistently going down. Kibler stabilized the board a three life with Wagener having no cards in hand, but Wagener top-decked a [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption) on the very next turn to end the game.

Sideboard

Kibler: -3 [Mesmeric Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend), -3 [Stronghold Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stronghold+Assassin), -2 [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch), -1 [Gempalm Polluter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Polluter), +2 [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), +2 [Corrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt), +2 [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), +3 [Mutilate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate)

Wagener: -2 [Reckless Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge), -1 [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), -1 [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla), +4 [Compost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compost)

### Game 2

Once again, Kibler fired off a first turn [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), taking out a [Volcanic Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer) over [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt). He then [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed a [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) and [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed out a second [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt), leaving Wagener with three lands in hand and a [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) in play. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natus03/a733.jpg)Wagener top-decked a [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd) to play next turn, while Kibler missed a third land drop. Just in time, Kibler drew a third land and cast [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch), removing [Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call) from the game. Wagener drew and cast [Compost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compost), then drew [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption) on the very next turn able to kill both Kibler's [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch) and [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade), and draw two cards in the bargain. Kibler was unable to deal with such card economy and fell to another Elephant token and [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) several turns later.

### Game 3

Wagener was forced to accept a double mulligan. His five-card hand was excellent – but it was still a five-card hand. Kibler took out a [Volcanic Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer) with yet another turn-one [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Wagener cast [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), while Kibler summoned a [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch).

With just one card in his graveyard, Wagener attacked with [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) into an untapped Wretch. Kibler accepted the trade. He blocked, and had Wagener remove both cards from his graveyard to finish off the Wretch via Lavamancer. Yet again, Kibler missed a fourth land drop for several turns, giving his opponent an opportunity to somewhat recover from the mulligan.

For the first time in three games, Kibler played his fourth land, finally able to summon a [Graveborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graveborn+Muse). Wagener did not like the concept of letting Kibler draw cards and killed it off with a [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption). Kibler got the Muse back via [Unholy Grotto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy+Grotto) played it, and met with a second Eruption. Kibler then took the time out to [Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher) an Elephant token and then [Mutilate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate) the board a few turns later.

It looked pretty scary for Kibler when his opponent finally got a [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) into play. Kibler used a [Corrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt) to kill off [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and buy some time. Fortunately for him, Wagener did not draw another creature and Kibler was able to Edict away the Centaur.

For the third time, Kibler summoned his [Graveborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graveborn+Muse). Wagener was holding two burn spells in hand. He cast [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) twice, and attacked with a [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel), bringing Kibler down to four life points. With [Graveborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graveborn+Muse) in play, he would be able to finish the game next turn with a [Volcanic Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer) – except Kibler brought his life total back with another [Corrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt), simultaneously removing [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natus03/a734.jpg)[Graveborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graveborn+Muse) was joined by [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch). Kibler attacked a couple of times and sealed the deal with a final [Corrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt) to the face.

### Game 4

Wagener opened with a [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). Kibler [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed on turn one as is his fashion, choosing [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd) over three burn spells. He then [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and cast second [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and double [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) to eliminate the rest of his opponent's hand. Meantime, Wagener flashed back his [Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call).

Wagener top-decked [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd) and [Compost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compost) in a row, while Kibler was able to play out a pair of [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch)es and remove the [Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call) from the grave. He used Edict to take out [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), and had to double block one of the two Elephant tokens in play, allowing Wagener to draw an extra card. 

Kibler was sitting on five [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s and two [Corrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt)s in hand. Had he drawn two lands in a row, he would have won the game as Wagener was at thirteen. However, he failed to draw a land and Wagener finished him off with [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption).

"The matchup is really not as bad as people think," Kibler commented later. "It's actually slightly in my advantage after sideboarding." Not with these draws.

**Final Result:** Wagener 3 – Kibler 1
