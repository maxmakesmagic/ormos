As you are presumably aware, the planeswalker Chandra, who first appeared in *Lorwyn* as [Chandra Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Nalaar), has reappeared in *Zendikar* as the angrier, more in-your-face [Chandra Ablaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Ablaze).

So what we're going to do today is give you a chance to compare the two portraits of Chandra. Ready? Go!
