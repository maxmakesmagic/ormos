Both Jasper De Jong and Magnus Lantto, the first and second-seed of the Top 4 players, showed off their knowledge of multiple formats all weekend. The two represent some very different strategies in all of the Constructed formats, which leads to some very interesting match-ups in the finals.



**Vintage**



The two players both 3-0'd the Vintage portion of their tournament with blue control decks looking to gain advantage through token-generating creatures. While De Jong preferred a light number of [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor)s, Lantto was all about [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), and the [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) or four that go along quite nicely with it.



Magnus Lantto was in the driver's seat for the entirety of Game 1, leading with a blind call on [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) to hit De Jong's [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will). De Jong, who had to mulligan to six, was card light, and Lantto's plays left him with few resources to combat what Lantto was capable of doing.



After a few turns, Lantto found a [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) after a Gush, and the elemental tokens that followed made quick work of De Jong.

The second game wasn't any better, as De Jong went to six cards, had his [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) hit with [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep), and was left with four lands and a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will). Lantto, meanwhile, had a hand full of gas. While De Jong was able to effectively "[Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall)" with a [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), shuffling back some of his lands for the three spells he found off of the powerful cantrip, Lantto undid the damage with [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) and another [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), stripping De Jong of anything relevant and locking up the match.



**Modern**



While De Jong demonstrated he could beat Elf Company, Lantto's deck, with his Melira & Company deck on Friday, this was not what happened in Game 1. Playing a land tapped rather than untapped left De Jong without the ability to leave white mana up when [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) in response to [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) for three. This proved devastating, as [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) got back a [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) that he could no longer cast, while Lantto found [Ezuri, Renegade Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%2C+Renegade+Leader), which cemented the win.

The second game went about as fast, with De Jong missing a land drop on a critical third turn, while Lantto flooded the field with elves. Multiple [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) and [Ezuri, Renegade Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%2C+Renegade+Leader) locked up the game, the match, and the championship title for Lantto.
