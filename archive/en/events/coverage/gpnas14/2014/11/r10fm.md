**(22) Black/Severa/Vidugiris vs. Wescoe/(17) Hayne/Skarren**


The team de-facto called "Team Madison" ran hot all yesterday. No. 22 Sam Black, Matt Severa, and Gaudenis Vidugiris are starting Day 2 sitting at 8-1, just below the pole position. Right up there with them was team "It's Hayne's Fault" (see how the team got together in yesterday's coverage), Craig Wescoe, No. 17 Alex Hayne, and Frank Skarren.


The decks lined up well this round, with no archetype mirrors; it was a nail-biter.



**(22) Sam Black vs. Craig Wescoe**



These games were the at the same time the most traditional and the least traditional of the round. Most people in the audience could guess that Craig Wescoe was on an aggressive white-based strategy. It was with red spells as well that were equally aggressive. While Sam Black's was a Jeskai deck that played control here. 



 With multiple [Warden of the Eye](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+Eye) and [Narset, Enlightened Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset%2C+Enlightened+Master), and a bevy of early removal spells, if Black could survive the first few turns, he would most certainly survive the whole thing. The team described as a "pile," but I'm going to be a bit more diplomatic and just that that in this match it "played control."




 Wescoe sprinted out of the gates with [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way), [Jeskai Student](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Student), [Horde Ambusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horde+Ambusher), [Defiant Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defiant+Strike). Black was down to 12 before he got any real presence on the board. He had big spells that took his whole turn, so he fell behind quickly.




 But a sequence of turns flopped the game around. Black went [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm), then [Warden of the Eye](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+Eye) to return it. Just for the extra nug, when Wescoe triple-blocked the Warden to get the biggest guy off the table, Black had a [Feat of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feat+of+Resistance) to just make it bigger. The game was over soon after that.




 The second started the same. Black opened with a [Jeskai Banner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Banner), while Wescoe had a [Horde Ambusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horde+Ambusher) and a morph. On the next attack Black asked, "I take seven?" He was right; the morph was [Canyon Lurkers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Lurkers).




 But just like the second game started the same, so too it ended. Black barely stabilized enough to land, then attack with, a [Narset, Enlightened Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset%2C+Enlightened+Master). It grabbed a [Force Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Away) (that was subsequently returned with two [Warden of the Eye](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+Eye)), and then on Black's self-admitted "Let's-attack-and-see-what-happens" turn, attacking with his team, Narset flipped up a [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm) and a [Flying Crane Technique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Crane+Technique).
