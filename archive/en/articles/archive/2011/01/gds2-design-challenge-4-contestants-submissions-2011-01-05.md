Way back in 2010, the six remaining Great Designer Search 2 finalists received [feedback from the judges](/en/articles/archive/gds2-episode-4-trading-places-2010-12-22-0) on their Challenge #3 submissions. One of them was [cut from contention](/en/articles/archive/gds2-episode-4-design-challenge-elimination-2010-12-22-0), and the remaining five were given [the fourth Design Challenge](/en/articles/archive/design-challenge-4-booster-shot-2010-12-22-0).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/mm/mm106_gds.jpg)Here's that Design Challenge again:



> 
> They say you only have one chance to make a good first impression. For this Design Challenge I am going to give each of you the chance to create the best first impression you can. Imagine a player is opening his or her first booster from your set. I want you to build the perfect booster for that player to open.
> 
> 
> The idea of this challenge is to present your set to someone who has never seen it before in the best possible light using only the contents from a single booster pack. Your booster will have:
> 
> 
> 
> > 
> > * 9 commons
> > * 3 uncommons
> > * 1 rare or mythic rare
> > * 1 premium card of any rarity (it is the perfect booster after all)
> > * 1 basic land
> > * 1 token card
> > 
> 
> 
> For each card besides the card text we are also going to allow you to explain what will be pictured in your art. Note that we aren't looking for an art description just a list of the relevant thing being pictured (e.g. "We see an elf dying to the Blight."). You may use no more than fifteen words to describe each piece of art.
