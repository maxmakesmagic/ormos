No. 23 Ranked Player Eric Froehlich put up an impressive finish with the touch of red that he added to the Black Devotion deck, finishing in the Top 16 and missing out thanks to some rough beats in the final rounds of Grand Prix Cincinnati. Today, he's playing the same general idea, but has some prepared with a few changes based on his expectations of what this week's metagame looks like. 



 "I made a few changes to the deck. I really liked it," Froehlich said. "This tournament, I actually have no red cards in the main deck, but I have three [Rakdos's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return)s in the sideboard.. [Rakdos's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return) is one of the best cards in Standard, but at the same time it needs complements."




 On the other hand, a card that was missing from his 75 in Cincinnati – [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) – has now made its appearance in his list. "I didn't play [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) in my main deck [in Cincinnati], because I think it's a lot weaker in Standard and I still think that, but the decks that it is better against I thought were going to be more popular this week," Froehlich explained.




 The expected popularity of Yuuya Watanabe's Grand Prix Beijing-winning list would favor [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) in the main deck, with Watanabe's one main-deck [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) making way for [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) to be a much stronger play. With the Blue Devotion decks now moving back to Mono-Blue, and away from variants running [Temple of Enlightenment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Enlightenment) and [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere), [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) is much better positioned strategy.




 The [Rakdos's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return)s work better out of the sideboard against decks like Esper and – surprisingly – the Jund Monsters decks since their deck can sometimes be too slow to deal with the card. "Against Esper, my plan morphs into stripping their hand of counterspells, letting them keep all their [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere)s and [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict)s. Just don't play things early, then hit them with [Rakdos's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return)," Froehlich said.



The game plan has been working out for him all day, and his metagame call also accurate. Froehlich sits at 7-0 going into the eighth round against Daniel Ward, who is bringing Bant Control to the table.



 While Froehlich's ability to strip a control deck's hand would be powerful, it was not a guaranteed route to victory if the control player could draw [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) at the right time.




**The Games**




 While Froehlich simply played a Swamp and a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) for his first two turns, Ward came out with immediate info on his deck archetype, casting [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) off of a [Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool) and [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain). Froehlich was more than happy to put [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) onto the table with his opponent lacking any way to respond. When Froehlich drew a card, he revealed his red splash with a tapped [Blood Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Crypt). An upkeep [Devour Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+Flesh) forced a [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) from Ward, who chose to save his 0/3 creature.
