GDS2, Episode 1 Design Challenge Elimination
============================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles?source=MX_Nav2020)
 on December 3, 2013 










One of the hardest parts of the GDS is that each Design Challenge I have to eliminate a candidate. After today, there will only be seven designers remaining. I will list each designer's name. If you click on it you will see whether they are in or out. Candidates that are in will have a green **CONTINUE PLAYING**. The candidate that is eliminated will have a red **GAME OVER**. I will then give a short summary of where I feel they stand or why they were eliminated.

And then there were seven ...


But for these seven, the work is just beginning.
