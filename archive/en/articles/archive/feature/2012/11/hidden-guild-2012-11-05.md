The guilds of *Return to Ravnica* cards are Azorius, Izzet, Rakdos, Golgari, and Selesnya. But because all ten guilds exist on Ravnica, you can sometimes see the influence of the other five guilds.


For example, take [Dispel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253566).

 Â 

 Because it's a blue card, [Dispel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253566) could technically be Azorius, Dimir, Izzet, or Simic. But if you examine the art carefully, you'll figure out which one it *really* is.

It's Simic! The mage is clothed in the Simic garb and he's got the characteristic facial spirals. And there's something else you might not have noticed. [Click here](javascript:void(0);) to see something really neat!

By turning the fire into a cloud of bubbles, the Simic mage is mimicking his own guild symbol! [Click here](javascript:void(0);) to see the original version again.
