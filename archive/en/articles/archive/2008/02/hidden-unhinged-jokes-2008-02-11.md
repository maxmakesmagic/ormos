There are many hidden jokes in *Unhinged*, but today we're going to show you some jokes that are so hidden they're barely even in the set.


These are the five DCI Alternate Art *Unhinged* promos (there's also a foil [Ashnod's Coupon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashnod%27s+Coupon), but that's not alternate-art. Also, it's from *Unglued*).

[Circle of Protection: Art](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Art)'s original joke is about a wizard being attacked by classic works of art. Mouse over for the alternate art, which involves a wizard being attacked by the art from [Stasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis), the Alpha [Nether Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Shadow), [Reverse Polarity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverse+Polarity), [Weakstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weakstone), and [Camouflage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Camouflage). Mark Tedin also included his own [Lord of the Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Pit) watching the action in the lower left (that's the back of his head). [Word of Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Word+of+Command) was originally included in the art ([click here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/cotd12172007_cop_art.jpg) for a larger version) but was cropped out of the final card.

The original [Mise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mise) art shows a large rabbit using its own foot for luck. Mouse over for the alternate art, which shows some dogs playing **Magic**. There's also a bucket of [Chicken a la King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chicken+a+la+King) under the table, which is an especially hidden joke!

Neither version of [Goblin Mime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Mime) seems very good at his job, but the alternate version (mouse over to see it) doesn't even seem to understand the concept: he's in an actual box, waiting for actual wind to walk against.

[Granny's Payback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granny%27s+Payback)'s old lady is still in the process of killing things in the regular art, but if you mouse over the image, you can see her standing atop a mighty mound of dead. That's kind of gruesome, actually. You also learn that Dakkon's grandmother is named "Eunice Blackblade", but we're not sure if she knows Grandmother Sengir.

The [Booster Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Booster+Tutor) flavor text in the original and alternate (guess how to access it!) versions goes two different ways for the joke, referencing *Arabian Nights* and *Homelands* respectively.
