"Ahh, Atlanta."



That's one of the famous catch phrases of Chris Pikula, after his Top 8 performance at Pro Tour - Atlanta in 1996, and it applies to others as well. Everyone has a bit of nostalgia for their best tournament accomplishments, especially if they happenened four years ago. Matt Vienneau is in the same boat. He had his best tournament accomplishment at Pro Tour - Atlanta, making Top 8, and has been struggling to recapture that ever since. He is matched up against Chris Benafel, who is a relative newcomer in the grand scheme of things. He put his name on the map by placing second in Pro Tour - Los Angeles 2000, losing to Trevor Blackwell in the finals, and then followed that up by placing second in US Nationals and helping the US Team win the team competition at Worlds.



The draft clearly favored Matt Vienneau, who drafted Black/Red and was completely uncontested on his right and fought for red with Mark LePine on his left. He ended up with a Breath of Darigaaz, a Ghitu Fire, and a Reckless Assault along with a great selection of creatures, while his opponent, Chris Benafel, was forced to draft three colors and had to fight with David Humpherys for both Green and White cards. Matt Vienneau seemed to have the edge over Chris Benafel and his Green/White/Red deck, but both players were fierce competitors, so it was still anyone's game.



Game 1

Matt Vienneau won the die roll and chose to play first. He cast a third turn Drake Skull Cameo, followed up by a fourth turn Hooded Kavu. Benafel responded by Harrowing on the third turn and casting an Ancient Kavu on the fourth turn. Matt would not be stopped by an Ancient Kavu, however, and he proceeded to bounce it with Urborg Emissary with the kicker, using the Drake Skull Cameo for blue mana and attacking with the Hooded Kavu. On the following turn, he bounced Benafel's Ruham Djinn, which came out to replace the Kavu, with another Urborg Emissary. At 13 life, with no creatures in play, Chris Benafel was forced to play catch-up, struggling to cast enough creatures and creature elimination spells to stop Vienneau's mounting offense. He wasn't able to do enough, however, as Vienneau was able to get Benafel low enough on life to finish him off with Ghitu Fire.



Game 2

After losing the first game, Chris Benafel chose to play first, hoping to get off to a quick enough start to stall Matt Vienneau's initial creature rush and take control of the game. Chris Benafel began with a second turn Crimson Acolyte and Matt responded with a Shivan Zombie. Matt Vienneau followed the Shivan Zombie up with a Firebrand Ranger, which was promptly Zapped by Chris Benafel. While the Crimson Acolyte and Shivan Zombie were racing, Matt Vienneau cast a Firescreamer, which was Shackled by Chris Benafel on the following turn. Since Matt Vienneau had an untapped Firescreamer, Benafel couldn't attack with his Crimson Acolyte and Vienneau mistakenly thought that he couldn't attack with Shivan Zombie, despite the fact that the Zombie has Protection from White and thus can't be blocked by white creatures. Vienneau made the same mistake over three turns, missing out on six points of damage to Benafel, but still managed to overwhelm Benafel with multiple creatures, a Reckless Assault, and a Ghitu Fire, as Benafel failed to draw any spells besides the Crimson Acolyte, the Zap, and the Shackles.



Matt Vienneau defeats Chris Benafel 2-0
