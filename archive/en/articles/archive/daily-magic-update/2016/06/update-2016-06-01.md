The June 1, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on June 1, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by *Eternal Masters*, because that's pretty much all anyone wanted to write about today.


Today's Must
============


1. [How to Playtest Properly](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33024_How-To-Playtest-Properly.html) | StarCityGames.com | Michael Majors

Playtesting isn't something a lot of people need to do, but those who do don't often do it well. Michael Majors, one of the best-performing players on the Pro Tour this season, lays down the fundamentals of playtesting. If you're a little lost on why your latest brew seemed so good in testing, only to fall flat on its face, Majors might have the answer.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Breaking Down *Eternal Masters* Limited](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13309&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=6-1-2016) | TCGPlayer | Seth Manfield

If you're looking forward to drafting *Eternal Masters*, Seth Manfield is here to make sure you can make the most of it by crushing the competition with superior knowledge. Because knowing is half the—what's that? We can't use that phrase?


Okay, how about: Having knowledge in your head is approximately 50% of the contest!


1. [Max Kahn: Everything You Need to Know About *Eternal Masters*](http://articles.nerdragegaming.com/max-kahn-everything-you-need-to-know-about-eternal-masters/) | Nerd Rage Gaming | Max Kahn

When Max Kahn, a level 2 judge, says "everything," he means "all of the rules things." This article dives deep into the many different abilities and key words for *Eternal Masters*, plus a few card-specific rules.


The question he doesn't answer: Why is there no [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) in this set? Some things are just too hurtful to discuss publicly.


1. [*Eternal Masters* Set Review](https://www.rocketjump.com/listen/eternal-masters-set-review-109) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

Commander definitely didn't get left out of the cold in *Eternal Masters*, so Josh and Jimmy made a video about their favorite cards in the set. The format-specific set review is a staple of modern *Magic* content production, so enjoy this pristine example.


Also, [Maelstrom Wanderer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Wanderer) is greater than all.


1. [Commander VS: Pauper Edition!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33028_Commander-VS-Pauper-Edition.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

Commander, Pauper? Does that even? But how does it? But what about?


Okay, so the gist of it is that your commander is an uncommon card, and the rest of your deck is made up of commons. In light of all of the new toys brought by *Eternal Masters*, the timing of this video is pretty great.

Top 25

1. A shuffle here, a shuffle there

This week's big mover is Luis Scott-Vargas, who jumps up five spots. The North American Hall of Fame Pro (as if you needed to be told who he was), is having a fantastic 2016, and since the rankings trail a year, he's only going to continue moving up the rankings as 2015 results fall off. Other risers include Yuuwa Watanabe, who just nabbed a Grand Prix Top 8, and Shota Yasooka, who is now fourth in the rankings.


Oh, and Seth Manfield and Owen Turtenwald still lead the field by a country mile, though Owen's Grand Prix Top 8 from this past weekend helped narrow the gap.


A note about Fabrizio Anteri: He was disqualified from an event this past weekend for deck manipulation. He will remain on the Top 25 rankings for the time being. If he is suspended (and please keep in mind, there is an investigation that still needs to happen), we'll re-evaluate at that time.

What People Are Talking About

> 
> 
>  — Raphael Levy (@hahamoud) [June 1, 2016](https://twitter.com/hahamoud/status/737996761336156160)

Hall of Fame great Raphaël Lévy won [Grand Prix Manchester](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpman16) over the weekend with a slightly updated take on Green-White Tokens playing [Chandra, Flamecaller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller). Except he did it without playing a single red source of mana. And won the tournament. [Oath of Nissa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) is a heck of a card, though the whole deal still [left fellow Hall of Fame pro Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa perplexed](https://twitter.com/PVDDR/status/737804919978266624).


1. [Top 5: Art of *Eternal Masters*](http://sarpadianempiresvol-viii.tumblr.com/post/145256289376/top-five-art-of-eternal-masters) | Sarpadian Empires Vol. VIII | Andrew Weisel

There's a lot of talk about the new art for *Eternal Masters*, and this is just one such Tumblr post dedicated to it. Others [look at Wasteland](http://damnyoumodoshuffler.tumblr.com/post/139371040359/this-is-neat), [Control Magic and some friends](http://mtg-talk.tumblr.com/post/144862692181/wow-the-new-arts-theyve-been-giving-cards-are), and a Steve Argyle post on [what he pitched for Nevinyrral's Disk](http://steveargyle.tumblr.com/post/144917613682/one-of-my-original-pitches-for-nevinyrrals-disk).


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Magic Mics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics) | Evan Erwin, Reuben Bresler, and Erin Campbell

The Mics, they are so magic. Tune in tonight as the Magic Mics crew tackles the issues of the day, like—well, honestly it's been kind of quiet this week. I mean, besides the [disqualification scandal](https://twitter.com/JoelLarsson1991/status/737333439142236164), *Eternal Masters* being fully previewed, two Grand Prix, and [Lévy winning with a deck with no red mana for his Chandra, Flamecallers](#levy). So nothing much.


Tune in tonight at 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT on [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics) to see them, I don't know, twiddle their thumbs or something.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [No-Red, Chandra-Infused, Green-White Tokens](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpman16/top-8-decklists-2016-05-29)


Confused by the title? Me too. And I wrote it.


But here's the gist of it: Raphaël Lévy, member of the Pro Tour Hall of Fame and multiple-Grand Prix champion, won another Grand Prix. He did it with Green-White Tokens, a pretty stock archetype considered by many to be the best in Standard. His lands produced only green, white, and colorless mana.


And his deck contained two copies of [Chandra, Flamecaller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller). A red card.


So how in the world does all of that make sense? Easy. Lévy took an Oath. Four of them, even.


[Oath of Nissa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa).


There's not that much to say about the rest of the deck, but [Oath of Nissa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) does allow you to play off-color planeswalkers—we've just never seen anyone do it and succeed at a Grand Prix–level. Until now.


The rest of the deck wasn't particularly splashy, but it did open the door to the possibility that it is feasible to "splash" a planeswalker or two off of just [Oath of Nissa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa). The proof is in the trophy.
