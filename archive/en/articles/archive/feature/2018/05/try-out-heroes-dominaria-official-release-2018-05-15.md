*Dominaria* is the gift that keeps on giving, and the next particular gift it's going to give is *Heroes of Dominaria*, a tabletop strategy game designed by Wizards of the Coast and published by WizKids set in the world of Dominaria. It releases in July, but there are some opportunities coming up to try it out before then!


The first opportunity will be at the UK Games Expo June 1–3 in Birmingham, UK. WizKids will have a booth (1-E2, if you're getting technical) where you can try out the game. Then, WizKids will be bringing its demo-show on the road to Origins Game Fair June 13–17 in Columbus, Ohio (booth 601).


What will you be trying out? Glad you asked, because I had all these bullet points prepared and it would be a shame to leave them unbulleted.


* *Heroes of Dominaria* lets you play as Jhoira, Karn, Teferi, or Chandra!
* You'll draw mana from familiar locations, such as Llanowar and Keld.
* You'll use mana to power abilities, recruit other heroes, go on quests, cast spells, rediscover lost artifacts, and, of course, confront the Cabal. Whoever saves the Multiverse first wins.
* The game is recommended for two to four players ages fourteen and up with a play time of 60–90 minutes.
* A premium version will be released in August that will have four painted miniatures of Jhoira, Karn, Teferi, and Chandra.

So, basically, you get to travel around Dominaria (awesome), take on the role of Jhoira, Karn, Teferi, or Chandra (I call Teferi forever), and go on a quest to defeat the Cabal (basically all I want to do with my life). Definitely take advantage of those sneak peeks if you can.


Want more? Check out this video from BoardGameGeekTV where they give a preview of the game for your viewing pleasure.

Still not enough? You want some never-before-seen images of the game? Well aren't we demanding. And in luck! Check these out these images below of the board and renders of the minis available with the premium version of the game. Then check out *Heroes of Dominaria* at UK Games Expo June 1–3 or Origins Game Fair June 13–17.
