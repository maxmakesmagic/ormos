### Comments:


The biggest goal this round was to ensure that the colors played well together while maintaining their Utopian identities. Each color still has its own themes, but we're seeing more bleed into allied colors. To fit this, I've moved from the idea of separate Utopian societies to factions within a larger civilization.


We have a number of things going on in this pack. Survival is a green-centered mechanic we've been working on to represent "adapting for war" at lower rarities. Dreamwalk shows a unique combat tactic for blue. The Shrine cycle shows off the flavor I'm going for with flip cards - peaceful objects being turned into weapons. And we've still got Gold and Mercenaries.


Mobilize/Creaturefall was a fine mechanic, but didn't represent Utopia well enough to keep. I like Mandate ("if you have the most creatures") quite a bit, but I don't think it has enough safe design space to warrant a heavy theme or ability word.


Woodward and Treat's idea of Hybrid Invaders was well-received last round, so I decided to explore that idea. The goal was to make them feel scary and alien across all colors, without violating the color pie or identities. They also allow me to use some important effects that don't fit well into Utopia, such as burn.


The Shrine untapping when it flips and the Flameweaver making hasty tokens are both technically unnecessary, but sync up with related cards.
