Today we released yet another in a long line of [banned and restricted announcements](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/september-22-2014-dci-banned-restricted-list-announcement-2014-09-22), dating back virtually to the game's beginnings. The [modern banned and restricted list](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/bannedrestricted) is heavily curated, always watched, and typically very sensible.



The first list might have been, well, a little soft in some of those areas.



The first list was actually published on USENET way back in the day (think of it as a precursor to Internet message boards, forums, or even reddit). You can actually see the full text of it still, [right here](http://archive.wizards.com/dci/downloads/firstdcifloorrules.txt), preserved for posterity's sake.



Just for fun, let's look at what that first restricted list looked like:



* [Ali from Cairo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ali+from+Cairo)
* [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall)
* [Berserk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk)
* [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)
* [Braingeyser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braingeyser)
* [Dingus Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dingus+Egg)
* [Gauntlet of Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gauntlet+of+Might)
* [Icy Manipulator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Manipulator)
* [Mox Pearl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Pearl)
* [Mox Emerald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Emerald)
* [Mox Ruby](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Ruby)
* [Mox Sapphire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Sapphire)
* [Mox Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Jet)
* [Orcish Oriflamme](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Oriflamme)
* [Rukh Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rukh+Egg)
* [Sol Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring)
* [Timetwister](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timetwister)
* [Time Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault)
* [Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk)


By and large it looked similar to the modern-day Vintage restricted list (at least as far as with cards that had actually been printed at the time) except for a few interesting nuggets.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=214&type=card)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=214&type=card)






You could probably add [Icy Manipulator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Manipulator), [Gauntlet of Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gauntlet+of+Might), [Rukh Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rukh+Egg), and [Ali from Cairo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ali+from+Cairo) to the list of oddities, but power levels varied a little bit back in *Magic's* early days. [Icy Manipulator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Manipulator) was actually one of the best cards in the game early on, and [Rukh Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rukh+Egg) suffered from confusion and unfortunate wording that led people to get 4/4 Rukh tokens simply by discarding it.


As for [Dingus Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dingus+Egg) and [Orcish Oriflamme](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Oriflamme)? The Oriflamme we can at least sort of blame on the fact that the Alpha printing was misprinted as costing only 1R. Sort of.


Additionally, *Magic* put out a Banned list at the same time that looked a little something like this:



* [Contract from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contract+from+Below)
* [Darkpact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkpact)
* [Demonic Attorney](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Attorney)
* [Jeweled Bird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeweled+Bird)
* [Shahrazad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shahrazad)


Ante cards were banned from tournaments from the get-go, and subsequently removed from the game altogether. [Shahrazad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shahrazad) was banned for being weird and time consuming and really poor for tournament play. I think we're all better off for that particular move.
