**Explanation of Changes**


Wizards of the Coast examines tournament results from each competitive Constructed format. When a format becomes imbalanced, or too many games are not interactive, we examine the cause.


Here are our changes:


**Legacy**


Over the past several months, the strategic diversity of Legacy has been diminished. Blue decks using [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) and various combo decks have occupied a greater portion of the metagame, pushing a lot of other decks out of the competitive scene. The problem is that other strategies tend to lose to the blue decks too frequently; they used to be more competitive, but now they fall behind when the blue decks reload for two mana using [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) is banned.


Some of the recent Legacy bans have been powerful card-drawing cards. Historically, [Black Vise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Vise) was a powerful card against those decks—and at times it was too powerful, limiting the metagame. Legacy decks are powerful enough that R&D does not think this is a likely problem, and the change might increase the diversity of the format. [Black Vise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Vise) is unbanned.


**Vintage**


Workshop decks have become more and more popular. However, too many games are effectively decided by the first player's first turn. A major problem is that a turn-one [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) for 0 deprives the opponent an opportunity to put Moxen on the battlefield. While players can adapt by not playing Moxen, the point of the format is to provide a place to play those cards. [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) is restricted.


[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) has reduced the diversity of the format, though in a somewhat different way than in Legacy. In Vintage, it has replaced many other card-drawers, creating a less diverse format. [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) is comparable to other restricted card-drawers, and now shares that honor. [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) is restricted.


In 2009, blue-based artifact decks were dominating the format. There were not many options of cards to restrict, and we chose [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge). This led to a much healthier metagame. However, six years later, a lot of cards have been added and the metagame is very different. The former dominating strategies are barely seen at all; the reason for the restriction is no longer evident. [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) is unrestricted.
