Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 





Yesterday, we showed off the promo cards that serve as the faces of the Intro Packs (hint: [they were all Dragons](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/dragons-tarkir-intro-packs-2015-03-03)), but every set has a number of promos beyond just those five (Dragons). As a bonus, this includes a few cards you haven't seen yet!



Tarkir Dragonfury Game
======================



First up, we have our Prerelease activity, the Tarkir Dragonfury Game, [which Gavin Verhey told you all about last week](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/tarkir-dragonfury-explanation-2015-02-24).

Launch
======



If you play in any Launch Event March 27–29—including Friday Night *Magic*, and on top of any other promos you might receive—you just might bring death and destruction to your foes with Deathbringer Regent.

Game Day
========



The weekend of April 18–19, 2015, stores all around the world will be holding *Dragons of Tarkir* Game Day. Just for participating, you can receive this full-art Scaleguard Sentinels, which may not be a Dragon, but it sure is friendly with them.

Buy-A-Box
=========



Finally, stores will be able to provide a small number of the Buy-a-Box promo, Ojutai's Command. The distribution is up to stores, so ask your local store if you want to get your hands on one of the newest Commands. Because why wouldn't you? Just look at this thing!
