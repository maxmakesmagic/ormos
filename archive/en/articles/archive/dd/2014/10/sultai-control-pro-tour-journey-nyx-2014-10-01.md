[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver)
All during the [Pro Tour](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptjou14), looking around the room, you could see people showing each other the top card of their library.


Why? Simple: [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). It's cute for a while, but eventually games would get to the point where people basically knew every card in their opponent's hand because of this effect. For better or worse, the *Theros* Block Constructed format was dominated by this three-mana card. Still, there were players who were able to find its natural enemy and use that to great advantage.


That card is [Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver).


Any advantage gained from using the Courser's ability to play lands from the top of the library and thus improve draw quality gets swept away by Ashiok's library destruction, and levels the playing field again.


Another thing to be afraid of: the timing of playing Ashiok's abilities is entirely under the control of the person playing Ashiok. That sounds obvious, but in practical terms it means the Ashiok player can cause a mana flood for the Courser player by activating Ashiok only when there's a nonland card revealed.


With creature-light pure control decks likely to disappear along with [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), this mysterious Planeswalker may be weaving lots of nightmares soon.
