*Editor's Note: The main event maximum capacity for the new venue has been added.*


Tournamentcenter.eu, the tournament organizer for Grand Prix Prague, has announced a change of venue. The new venue will support a maximum main event player capacity of 2,000, which is an increase from the previously announced location.


The Grand Prix will now take place at:


Výstaviště PVA Expo Praha  

Beranových 667  

199 00 Praha 18 - Letňany  

Czech Republic


The new venue is easily accessible via Prague's metro system. The metro stop is Letňany, Line C.


A hotel room block has been set up for players at Hotel Duo, which is located two metro stops away from the new venue. More information on this deal can be found at [tournamentcenter.eu](http://www.tournamentcenter.eu/).


Any player who has had their travel plans affected by this change may contact [premierplay@hasbro.be](mailto:premierplay@hasbro.be) for assistance.


Grand Prix Prague takes place June 10–12, 2016. The format for the main event is Legacy Constructed.
