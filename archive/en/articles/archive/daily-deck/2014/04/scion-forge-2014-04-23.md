 When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he dreamt of a job making Magic cards—and now as a Magic designer, he's living his dream! Gavin has been writing about Magic since 2005. 






When *Theros* first came out, W/R [Purphoros, God of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%2C+God+of+the+Forge), decks were all the rage. Cards like [Assemble the Legion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assemble+the+Legion) and [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion), allowed you to pump out tokens really quickly, triggering Purphoros or hitting them with Purphoros later. As devotion decks took over, the Purphoros decks were deemed a little too slow. As it turns out, once you add green for mana acceleration, the deck gets a boost and might be a contender.



![Scion of Vitu-Ghazi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Scion%20of%20Vitu-Ghazi&options=)With *Born of the Gods*, Purphoros found a new ally in [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos). The deck always needed a cheaper token maker, and the cat king performs that task admirably. The real unsung hero might actually be [Scion of Vitu-Ghazi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+Vitu-Ghazi), a card that saw play briefly at Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze*. While there are no [Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm) tokens to populate, there's still the elemental token left behind from [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence).

If I were a slow control deck, I'd be terrified to play against HeroesofKern, as his deck is jam-packed with must-answer threats. Against aggressive decks, you absolutely have to draw the early brick walls in your deck like [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), Brimaz, or [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), but if you do, you should be in good shape. Overall, it's a pretty good spot to be in.
