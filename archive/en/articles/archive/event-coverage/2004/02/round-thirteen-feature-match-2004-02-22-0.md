Raul started with a first turn [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp), but didn't draw a land for the next two turns. His fourth turn [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) wasn't enough for his opponent's [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub) equipped with [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter). When JF used a [Carry Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carry+Away) on [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp), Raul conceded.

### Game 2

This time Raul played the [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) on his second turn and a [Cobalt Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobalt+Golem) on the third. When JF missed his third land drop and Raul cast [Chittering Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chittering+Rats). It only took two turns for the Frenchman to concede.

### Game 3

 JF brought [Titanium Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanium+Golem), [Auriok Transfixer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer) and [Auriok Glaivemaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Glaivemaster) into play, but the Myr made the Aurioks life a short one. Raul cast another [Cobalt Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobalt+Golem) and removed the [Titanium Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanium+Golem) with a [Betrayal of Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal+of+Flesh). An [Awe Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awe+Strike) from JF only delayed the unavoidable, and he conceded on his next turn.
