*You're drafting triple* Scars of Mirrodin*, and first pick, first pack you open [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) and [Geth, Lord of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geth%2C+Lord+of+the+Vault). Which do you take, and why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_tomlapille.jpg)**Tom LaPille:** That's a close pick, but I'd take the [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail). I have three reasons, in descending order of importance.

1) I put a lot of value on flexibility early in a draft. I am willing to make commitments to a color before I know what my neighbors are doing, but I prefer not doing so if possible. Because [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) costs only one red mana, I can easily splash it thanks to the proliferation of mana fixers in *Scars* that includes Myr, [Horizon Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Spellbomb), and the rare dual lands. Geth costs two black mana, which means that if I abandon black I am probably not playing it.

2) [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) is very strong and impossible to play around. It almost always trades for two of my opponent's cards. Unlike Geth, it cannot be [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest)ed or [Turn to Slag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Turn%2Bto%2BSlag) and reduced to trading one-for-one.

3) [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) is crushing against infect decks, while Geth is mediocre to actively bad against them.

Sign me up for the [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail).
