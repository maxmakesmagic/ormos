This week's "Sketches" looks at [Kilnmouth Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kilnmouth+Dragon), the enormous Amplifying, firebreathing Dragon from *Legions*. The card was illustrated by Carl Critchlow.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist. The card was originally called "Crystal Dragon" or "Bashing Dragon":

"Color: Red  
 Action: This is not your typical **D&D** dragon. Show a dragon (of the artist's imagination) on a rocky perch. He has fired a blast of hot sand at a couple of fleeing goblins. The superheated sand coats the goblins and when it cools off it turns to glass. So you end up with dead goblins covered in glass.  
 Focus: The dragon  
 Mood: intense"

### 2. Sketch

Here is Carl's first pass at what would become [Kilnmouth Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kilnmouth+Dragon): 

The art staff liked Carl's unusual take on the dragon concept, but the monster needed wings. In addition, it was recommended that the goblins be removed to keep the focus on the dragon. 

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. The bony protrusions and column of flame have stayed, but the beast now sports a huge pair of wings and the poor glassy goblins have been removed.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you'll see it in booster packs.
