The events formerly known as "Preview Streams" and "Streaming Events" are getting cooler, more alliterative moniker:


Streamer Showdowns!
===================




We're happy to announce that Streamer Showdowns will no longer be confined to a schedule of one-per-set release. From here on out, we'll be hosting *Magic Online* drafts for our community of awesome streamers once every month.


If you've never seen a Streamer Showdown before, they come in two eight-player Draft pods that feature some of the best streamers in the community brawling with the latest *Magic Online* sets. If you're trying to improve your game, *Magic Online* streamers are some of the best players out thereâ€”and some of the best teachers, too. Even if you're already a *Magic* pro, throw your support behind one of the competitors and cheer them on from their Twitch chat!


Our next event features the [newly updated Holiday Cube](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/holiday-cube-updates-2015-06-22)! Check out the streamer lineup below, then stop by your favorite streamer's Twitch channel on Thursday, July 16, at 1:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time (UTC-7) for the inaugural Streamer Showdown.
