Earlier this year, we launched our official *Magic* merchandise range with Zavvi in Europe, and with *Guilds of Ravnica* now available, it's time for a *huge* update to the range. Today, we've added over 100 new items to the store featuring all ten guilds of Ravnica.


This includes guild logo sweatshirts and T-shirts in both men's and women's fits:

An alternate T-shirt with front and back print, inspired by the world of sports:

And guild mugs for your hot drink of choice:

Listening to your feedback, we've also worked with Zavvi to add an increased size range (up to 5XL in certain colors) and a new non-clothing item, guild tote bags—perfect for carrying a playmat and snacks!
