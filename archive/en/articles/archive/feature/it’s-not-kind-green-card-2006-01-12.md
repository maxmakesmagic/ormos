Quick Quiz: What is the best Green card in Standard today?

![Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)If you said anything other than "[Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)" from *Champions of Kamigawa*, you haven't been paying attention to Constructed **Magic** for the last year and a half. The unassuming [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) with legs… err… *scales* hit the scene running, absorbed [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) collisions in its rookie season while setting up its master's mana, then just kept rolling while the rest of the format fell backward. [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) has both facilitated Forest-filled [Blanchwood Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blanchwood+Armor) attack decks and enabled all manner of polychromatic control and even combination options; thanks to its twin areas of expertise – buying time and manipulating mana – these decks, developing engines as far afield as [Enduring Ideal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal), infinite [Hana Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) recursion, and [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) Transmutation, have won tournament after tournament.Even if you didn't (CORRECTLY!) name [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) as the best Green card in Standard, you probably hit some other great Green or at least halfway Green card… perhaps [Glare of Subdual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual). If I hadn't named [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), I would almost certainly have scribbled down "[Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top)" or perhaps "[Meloku the Clouded Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror)" as my “Best Green card in Standard today” selection.

*What?* 

Those are not *Green* cards you say? 

The game's most time-consuming one mana artifact and the Clouded Mirror of Victory seem awfully Green to me. The polarizing [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), called by some the best artifact in *Kamigawa* Block – a block, remember, that featured the ubiquitous [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte)s – is played almost exclusively in Green decks featuring tons of shuffling effects. These decks are populated top to bottom with [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek), [Kodama's Reach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying), and [Wood Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wood+Elves). [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) may not have a Green border or a little Forest icon in the top-right corner, but believe you me, the Top of the hop has an "Honorary Green Card" membership... um... *card* in its pocket. So what about Meloku? 

The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled, it is sometimes repeated, was to convince the world that he doesn't exist; with no keen eyed paladins hunting for fallen angels wielding pitchforks, that cloven-footed troublemaker is free to play puppeteer unencumbered. Similarly, Meloku masquerades, hiding in plain sight with his Blue border, convincing us all that [Morphling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morphling)-class five drop flyers don't flap above the average Forest. Sure, there have been one or two successful *actual* Blue decks that have returned a land or two to grip in exchange for a 1/1 Illusion token, but for every Clouded Mirror in a Ruel brother's [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) sideboard, how many came out a turn – or even *two turns* – early via the ubiquitous [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and his cronies [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) or even the downside-deadening [Sakura-Tribe Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Scout)?

Are these the Green cards promised to you by your first dog-eared Core Set rulebook? Does [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror) seem like a brother to the Green that gave us the inexorable [Berserk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk), the potent rage of [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) – called by most the best two-drop in the storied history of a game defined by offensive two-drops? Are Green mages meant to block and then shuffle, peek at the tops of their decks, shuffle again, and then maybe pick up a land or two prior to *more blocking*? What about Green's pairing with White? Should the descendents of [Rogue Elephant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue+Elephant), the heirs to the mantle of [Rancor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancor) be relegated to *tapping* their foes before they can approach the field of battle? Isn't such a yellow-bellied, panty-waisted, approach to the pre-combat ritual disgustingly *Blue* – the hated Blue – Green's enemy from the earliest days of Alpha?

Personally, I fell in love with the wizened [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) the first time I laid eyes on it at the *Champions of Kamigawa* Prerelease. The gentrification of Green as a, shall we say, more *strategic* cadre has allowed the color to force itself into contention with Blue as the best in the game over the past couple of years. Pat Chapin recently told me he thought that [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) – another splashy champion of the new Green – was close to [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) in power, even!

Believe it or not, some Green mages just don't agree with the direction the color has been going the past couple of years. To them, cards like [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), working hand-in-hand with [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) to accelerate up to [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror), or engines where [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) pairs with [Lonely Sandbar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lonely+Sandbar) or [Barren Moor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Moor) to draw huge volumes of cards, are a betrayal of the color's core values. Green, they believe, is the color of the attack. *Give me a huge creature at a discounted mana cost*, they rage. Give me a weapon that can pierce the veil of slithering or flying 1/1 [Ethereal Haze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Haze)s. Show me any ally that can complement Green's fury!

To these players, the proper pairing for Green is not the elegant manipulator or evasive intellectual, but its polar opposite. Via the Gruul Clans, these Green players can trade in their surgical instruments for a quick drop blunt instrument:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/mf76_tmdxj0g6c2i5rv9g.jpg)When I first looked at this card, I didn't know what to make of it. Why would I want to play this? My first impression was that Burning-Tree Shaman was kind of like a symmetrical [Juzam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juzam+Djinn)... I would get an efficient 3/4 creature for three mana, but both of us would suffer the downside. Despite the dangerous legend commanded by the Juzam in elder days, a merely symmetrical substitution to its downside didn't seem good enough for me, not for a 3/4 for three, not when undercosted creatures like [Watchwolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watchwolf) and [Iwamori of the Open Fist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iwamori+of+the+Open+Fist) are available in the same format.

The problem was, I was thinking like the wrong kind of Green mage.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/mf76_k3rlbj2m06qqmfqb.jpg)Burning-Tree Shaman *hates* the idea that [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror), and – remembering the traditional (read: pre-Boros) enmity between White and Red – even [Glare of Subdual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual) are "Green" cards, let alone what most players think of when you ask them about Green cards. To the Burning-Tree Shaman, Green is the color of hitting people. The cards we've spent much of this article discussing – including to a lesser extent even [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) itself – prevent the Gruul Clans from hitting people. The Burning-Tree Shaman is sick of being held off by blockers. He is sick of being tapped before he can attack. What is the point of being an aggressively-costed attack creature if I can't get into the Red Zone? It's time to make these cowards pay. In life points.

While Burning-Tree Shaman will still get tapped by [Glare of Subdual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual), he will steal a point along the way. He will not usually trample over a (misguided) [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) or Illusion token, but point by point, he will make his presence known, giving beatdown decks a better chance to compete in an increasingly attack-hostile Standard format. In the greater scope of the game, he will really soar.

With Burning-Tree Shaman in play, it will be almost impossible for a Gruul-aligned beatdown player to fall to a lethal [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) attack. Usually the beatdown deck is ahead – many times *way* ahead – and the [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) deck wins out of nowhere with a fortunate [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) into an improbable [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder). For every +1/+1 the [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) earns, for every activation by the best creature in the game, the Burning-Tree Shaman will match (immediately), point for point… Good luck getting to 20 alive. Will there be anything *less* scary for a deck that is sure to be packing burn than an opposing [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) sitting next to an opposing [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus)?

A conflict or three with inevitable Extended teammate [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) notwithstanding, the Burning-Tree Shaman knows where his bread is buttered. He doesn't fool with mana abilities...*real* mana abilities that is. He is more than willing to take advantage of Green's traditional lynchpin, the one mana accelerator. He wants to hit the board on turn two, when a 3/4 is most potent. But that almost-Blue [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)? *Maybe* Burning-Tree Shaman will work with the best Green card in Standard... but even when they are playing on the same team, he isn't cutting his fellow Shaman any one damage breaks.
