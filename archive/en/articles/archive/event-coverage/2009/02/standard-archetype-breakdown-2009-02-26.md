The most popular archetype, by a nearly two-to-one ratio with the second place finisher, is Red-White [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) (also called "Boat Brew"). Featuring hits like [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny), [Fulminator Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage), [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid), and [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic), the deck has a powerfully aggressive early game tempered by a [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod)-resistant end game thanks to [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark). Many builds are also powered by [Ajani Vengeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant), [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession), and [Windbrisk Heights](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windbrisk+Heights).


In second place is Pro Tour-Hollywood standout Five-Color Control, formerly known as Quik 'N Toast. Banking on the powerful interaction between [Reflecting Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflecting+Pool) and the Vivid lands, the deck plays virtually any spell it wants. [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher) fights alongside [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) fights alongside [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum). Of course, the newly released *Conflux* has given the deck plenty of added oomph. Players have been seen using the anti-Faeries tech of [Volcanic Fallout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout) in their lists, as well as the under-rated [Ethersworn Adjudicator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Adjudicator).


Rounding out the top five are two aggro decks and an aggro control. Fifty Faeries players have brought the blue-black scourge, hoping to continue riding the back of [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) and [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to steal a Pro Tour victory. Kithkin and the Black-Red Aggro decks will be nipping at their heels, looking to make sure that doesn't happen.


Of course, it wouldn't be a Pro Tour without innovators. A group of players have come to play with similar builds of a Standard Tezzerator list, featuring [Esperzoa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esperzoa) to gain added advantage a la [Stampeding Wildebeests](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Wildebeests). [Rafiq of the Many](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rafiq+of+the+Many) has been seeing play in some very aggressive Bant Aggro decks, and a good number of well respected Japanese players have shown up with new kid on the block Swans Control.
