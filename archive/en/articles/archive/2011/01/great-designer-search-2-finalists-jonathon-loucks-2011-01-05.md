### Comments:


On @: An empty colorless symbol with a hard dark outline, and colorless cards with @ in their casting cost have punched-up colorless frame to help them stand out. (Similarly, prismatic cards have a punched-up multicolor frame.) Designing with @ has felt like creating the 6th color, without the difficult backwards-compatibility issues. I imagine @ having access to much of the color pie, but with the general theme of making the opponent's life more difficult - damage that can't be prevented, exiling things, can't be countered, unblockable, shroud, deathtouch, etc.


Ideally @ is as draftable as the other colors in limited, as well as being easily splashed. Colorless instants/sorceries are tricks that might be better saved for set two or three, but I'm presenting it here as an option.


On Cavern: Like the other basic lands, players have access to any number of caverns at tournaments, and can play any number in their deck. I can avoid creating a new basic land type by creating a new rule ~305.6b "A basic land with no basic land types has 'T: add 1 to your mana pool.'" This should avoid some of the rules issues a new type creates. Caverns would be distributed to tournament organizers and through booster packs as a possible basic land. I chose to give player's access to caverns because I didn't want people drafting cards they couldn't cast.
