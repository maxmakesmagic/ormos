Get a sneak preview of what to expect from coverage for July as we spotlight the Grand Prix leading into Pro Tour 25th Anniversary!


For reference, if you're looking at June, we have information on coverage for this month [from my article a few weeks ago](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/2018-worlds-details-plus-june-coverage-2018-05-17).


GP Sao Paulo
============


First up next month is [Grand Prix Sao Paulo](http://cfbevents.com/gpsaopaulo/), featuring a Modern Constructed main event July 7–8. We'll be bringing you live video coverage of this one, featuring a combination of European and Brazilian talent in the booth!


**Start Times**: 5 a.m. PT/12 p.m. UTC on Saturday and Sunday

*The production team for this event will be a regional crew managed by Willy Edel*.


After our first live video weekend from Brazil last year, the GP crew returns to bring you two days of the latest Modern action from South America as we get one last look at the format before the release of *Core Set 2019* and Pro Tour 25th Anniversary.


GP Sacramento and Chiba
=======================


The weekend of July 20–22 will be the first time *Core Set 2019* Limited will be showcased at a Grand Prix main event, with GPs happening in both [Chiba](https://ssl.bigmagic.net/article/gpchiba2018?lang=en) and Japan, as well as [Sacramento](http://cfbevents.com/gpsacramento/) in the USA.


While the Japanese coverage team broadcasts live coverage of Chiba in Japanese, we'll be bringing you live video from Sacramento in English for both days of the main event.

GP Minneapolis and Turin
========================


Wrapping up July and leading into Pro Tour weekend are Grand Prix in [Minneapolis](http://cfbevents.com/gpminneapolis/) and [Turin](http://cfbevents.com/gpturin/). Minneapolis will be the host of live video for that weekend, with coverage on July 28–29 to follow the action of the main event.

Both events will be one more good look at *Core Set 2019* Limited before we shift our focus toward teams to watch out for heading into the Team Trios Constructed format of Pro Tour 25th Anniversary.


July's going to be a fun month, with the core set back and multiple weekends of coverage that will showcase what to look forward to in an upcoming new Limited format. Tune in to [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) to see it all live!
