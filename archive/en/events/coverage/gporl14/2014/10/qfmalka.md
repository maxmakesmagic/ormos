 It's been over twelve years since Sol Malka claimed his Grand Prix Tampa title. In the interim he's never stopped opening booster packs and drafting *Magic* along the way. With his name attached as the originator of The Rock archetype – black-green decks that grind away at opponents' resources – and a travel range limited to the Southeast United States, it's easy to miss his name.




 Narrowly missing an undefeated record on Day 1 and delivering a decisive run across his first two *Khans of Tarkir* drafts makes it clear how much skill, and maintaining it over time, really matters in the game. With a calm countenance, he never seemed frazzled and always played to his plans.



His plans have earned him a spot at next February's Pro Tour Fate Reforged. Not bad to 12 years of practice in between.



 Across from him sat Pro Tour *Magic 2015* Top 4 contender and Grand Prix Oklahoma City winner Pierre Mondon. Returning to the Pro Tour from that Grand Prix win, and extending his stay thanks to his performance upon arrival, it exactly what one would call a hot streak.



Here, in a totally new Limited format it's obvious that Mondon's streak hadn't cooling down.



**The Decks**




 While Malka had marched to the Top 8 using primarily two-color focused decks, his Top 8 selection was much more in line with what had been seen all day: A bevy of nonbasic lands to supporting casting heavyweights such as [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer), and [Sagu Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sagu+Mauler) were all powerful rares in their own right. The bulk of Malka's deck was a core of black creature and removal with some green to support delve, a powerful base to unlock his multicolor beatsticks.




 Mondon meanwhile crafted a deck closer to true clan roots. Building an aggressive Mardu deck around the power of [Ankle Shanker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ankle+Shanker), [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom), and [Mardu Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Charm), it wasn't clear what two copies of [Mardu Banner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Banner) were doing alongside them. Two copies of Mardu Warshireker with on-color nonbasic lands to help fix mana seemed to set Mondon up to always have a way to cast his most colorful spells.




**The Games**




 Malka led the first game early with [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer), backed up with removal like [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury). Mondon spent a [Mardu Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Charm) to deal with it before unleashing [Ankle Shanker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ankle+Shanker) upon the world. Malka declined to block with [Kheru Bloodsucker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kheru+Bloodsucker) and [Sultai Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Scavenger), but used [Mardu Skullhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Skullhunter) and Rakshasa's Secret to shred everything out of Mondon's hand.
