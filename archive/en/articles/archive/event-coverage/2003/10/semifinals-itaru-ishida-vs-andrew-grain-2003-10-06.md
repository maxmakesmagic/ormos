Itaru Ishida The only non-Australian member of the top 8, having snuck in by the most slender of margins on resistance, has progressed to the final 4 and now plays Melbourne's Andrew Grain. Ishida has drafted a removal-heavy red/black, and must face Grain's red/white monstrosity.

Ishida plays and opens with a [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow), followed by a [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica). Grain opening gambit consisted of a [Raise the Alarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) and a [Yotian Soldier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier), which was brought down straightaway with an [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt). Ishida set his mind to task on slowly removing the Soldier tokens. 

Attacking into the Goblin, the soldier tokens were duly brought down, but they had done their job putting 1 point of combat damage on the Replica, which in turn was finished off by a [Granite Shard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Shard). Ishida, unfussed by all this, pushes his offensive forward, with a [Vulshok Berserker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker), bringing Grain down the 14. Grain then found a [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar) with his [Taj-Nar Swordsmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taj-Nar+Swordsmith), equipping his [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub), which attacked back to even the life totals up at 14.

A [Yotian Soldier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier) on Ishida's side provided ample defense on the ground, as Ishida took out the Swordmith and an [Auriok Steelshaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Steelshaper), with 2 more [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt)s in consecutive turns. With little defense Grain is brought down to 7 on the following turn, and then to 6 with the Longbow. Attacking twice with the Cub however, keeps Grain in the game, and leaves the scores close at 7-6 in Ishida's favour - making Ishida think long and hard with a Grain finding a [Granite Shard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Shard). An alpha strike from Ishida, with the Yotian, the Berserker and a freshly activated [Stalking Stones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones), looked imminent, but a [Grab the Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins) took the stones out of combat, with Ishida tapping for 1 mana to keep them off blocking. With no mana left, he swung for 4, putting Grain and just 2, but could only consider doing 1 more with the Longbow equipped Yotian. 

Passing back he took a burn, taking him down to 6, and then to 5 in the end step - letting Grain attack with the Cub for 4 in the air and getting home for the last point with the shard for the closest of wins possible.

Grain 1 leads Ishida 0.

### Game Two

Both players start out with second turn Myrs, the new standard on limited play (as opposed to the third turn morph), with Ishida finding a third turn [Nim Shrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker). Sadly for him, the flier didn't last long with Grain trumping it with a third turn active [Granite Shard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Shard). 

Ishida took the offensive to Grain with a [Hematite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hematite+Golem), putting grain down to 13 within the next 2 turns, with Grain unwilling to block with his unequipped [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub) or his [Auriok Steelshaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Steelshaper). Trying to compound the pressure for Grain, Ishida cast a [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica), which was picked off by a [Pyrite Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) the following turn before the mana was open for it's use.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpsyd03/911.jpg)The cub scored 2 for Grain, but fell to a [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) when an attempt to equip it with a [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar) (searched for by a [Taj-Nar Swordsmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taj-Nar+Swordsmith)). All was not lost as the defenses held with a [Banshee's Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banshee%27s+Blade) and an [Ogre Leadfoot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Leadfoot) coming into to hold the fort. A nominal offense could not be offered however as Ishida's [Krark Clan Grunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark+Clan+Grunt) was there to threaten to take down any attacker with first strike.

Not even being allowed to power up his [Banshee's Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banshee%27s+Blade) by sending in creatures sacrificially, Grain seemed content to hold back and whittle away the required 20 by [Granite Shard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Shard). Ishida found a Longbow to re-enter the race in the stalled game but by then had already taken 9 from the Shard, leaving him on 6. Grain, sensing the victory was not far off, and being able to keep the weaker creatures of the board ([Nim Shrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker)s and Myrs) pushed forward with [Raise the Alarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) tokens, the [Ogre Leadfoot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Leadfoot) and the [Taj-Nar Swordsmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taj-Nar+Swordsmith). With only a Yotian and a [Krark Clan Grunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark+Clan+Grunt) (the [Hematite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hematite+Golem) and the [Stalking Stones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones) were tapped down with the [Auriok Transfixer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer)), Ishida was forced to take another 2, dropping to 4 and after drawing 2 more land he scooped and congratulated Grain in his victory.

Grain defeats Ishida 2-0.
