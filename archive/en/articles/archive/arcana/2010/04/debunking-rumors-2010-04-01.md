There are a lot of rumors swirling around the Internet about *Rise of the Eldrazi*, and today's **Magic** Arcana is devoted to debunking some of them.

All of the following is completely true, as far as you know.

* *Rise of the Eldrazi* does not contain any hybrid mana symbols.
* The word "artifact" was not purposely omitted from the type line of [Walking Atlas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Atlas).
* The average converted mana cost of *Rise of the Eldrazi* cards is not 12.
* The Eldrazi will not be novelty oversized cards, due to potential difficulties concerning shuffling.
* There is no "secret" keyword mechanic that has not yet been previewed.
* The Comprehensive Rules will not be amended to state that altering the color of a card's border alters that card's color, and Eldrazi cannot gain colors in this fashion.
* *Rise of the Eldrazi* is not in fact the long-lost "real" third set of the *Mirage* block, nor was it found in a filing cabinet in Aaron Forsythe's office.
* There are 248 cards in *Rise of the Eldrazi*. There is no secret 249th card that appears only in foil.
* The "level up" mechanic is not based on the Wizards of the Coast staff promotion process, nor vice versa.
* There is no single theory that can fully describe every **Magic** interaction, no matter how complex and nuanced it is.
* Rumored mechanics lifetouch and deathlink do not appear in *Rise of the Eldrazi*.
* Collecting a complete foil set of *Zendikar* block both on **Magic Online** and in paper **Magic** does not entitle you to one (1) free Richard Garfield. Because that would be slavery, and slavery is bad.
* *Fall of the Eldrazi*, a 145-card expansion, will not be released worldwide on Friday, May 29, 2010.
* The original sketches for the Eldrazi Spawn tokens were not sent back due to being "X-rated."
* There is no "RYZ of the Eldrazi" shoe design.
* [contraption joke]
* Hasbro has no plans for a *My Little Eldrazi* tie-in.
* No card in the set creates a 3/5 colorless Catoblepas token. Accordingly, no such token has been printed.
* "Dredge" is not an acceptable name for decks which do not contain the dredge mechanic.
* There is no secret connection between Ravnica's Gruul Clans and Zendikar's Guul Draz vampires. Or is there? No, there isn't. (Maybe.)
* Mark Gottlieb does not drink.
* The set's original design file was not the result of a dare to see who could get the most ridiculously large creature printed.
* **Magic** R&D is not running out of ideas.
* **Magic** R&D is not running out of ideas.
* The "rebound" mechanic was not stolen from **NBA Showdown**.
* After conquering Zendikar, the Eldrazi are not going to Disneyland.
* Kozilek is not the long-lost son of Commodore Guff, and there are no obscure storyline hints to support this theory, particularly not on page 237 of J. Robert King's *Apocalypse*.
* It is not true that things born in magma are not always angry. They are.
* It is not the case that the Prerelease won't be *totally awesome!!* Am I right, guys???
* There is no secret fourth text box on all the levelers that is accessible only to Premium members.
* [Leveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leveler) will not be reprinted with the "level up" mechanic. [Root-Kin Ally](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Root-Kin+Ally) will not be updated with the creature type Ally.
* The production of *Rise of the Eldrazi* was not cursed.
* Zooming in on a high-resolution version of the art of Emrakul, the Aeons Torn will not reveal that Emrakul is drinking a delicious Pepsi. Mmmm, Pepsi.
* Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre is not Tiago Chan's Invitational submission. It hardly looks like him at all.
* No cards in *Rise of the Eldrazi* were accidentally printed with their playtest names intact. Neither Nagle-Bodied Troops nor Ginger Snap appear in the set.
* It is not true that anyone who sends us a story about their dog via our web form will receive a copy of Baneslayer Angel.
* In the event of an emergency, *Rise of the Eldrazi* cannot be used as a flotation device.
* It is patently false that the Eldrazi are colorless because our printer ran out of purple ink.
