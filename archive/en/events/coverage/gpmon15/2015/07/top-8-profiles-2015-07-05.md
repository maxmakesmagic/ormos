**What did you play Saturday, and how did you do?**  

Black-Red Aggro with two Dragon bombs and way too many good spells. I went 9-0 and 18-2 (games) on the day. Great pool that built itself.





**What did you draft today, and how did that go?**  

First draft I was blue-red tempo with no bombs but a great cruve/removal. Went 2-1 losing a close match to a guy (Josh) who played great. Sencond drafy I was 1-1-1 with white-red aggro with little push through. I misread some signals at the table.



**What were your best commons or uncommons this weekend? Why?**  
[Twin Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twin+Bolt)/[Tail Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tail+Slash)/[Butcher's Glee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher%27s+Glee). First two are obvious the [Butcher's Glee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher%27s+Glee) really wins the grindy games.




**What do you want open for pack one, pick one? Why?**  

I would like to open a really aggressive bomb. Nothing in particular (I’m not that greedy) just something that puts me in a color and wins me some games.




**What has you most excited about *Magic Origins*?**  

I have been off and on *Magic* for 14 years. This set looks great and after my finish today I’m jumping back in full force.

**What did you draft today, and how did that go?**  

First draft went blue-black tempo. Won all my mulligans ot five cards so everything went ok. Got 3-0. Second draft went green-white. Opened [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) got passed a second one. Last pack a got [Temur War Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+War+Shaman) fifth pick and [Abzan Beastmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Beastmaster) thirteenth pick. Happy Gautier!



**What were your best commons or uncommons this weekend? Why?**  
[Abzan Beastmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Beastmaster) has been awesome. With some [Glade Watcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glade+Watcher) it’s insane. [Sight Beyond Sight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sight+Beyond+Sight) has performed well as well.




**What do you want open for pack one, pick one? Why?**  

I don’t want Dragons. I never open them anyway. I guess [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price).

The power level seems extremely high and it should shake up Standard.
