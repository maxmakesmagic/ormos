*Magic 2015* is on the horizon, and [it's looking awesome](http://magic.wizards.com/content/magic-2015-core-set-card-set-archive-products-game-info). Besides [the exciting cards](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/top-decks/ode-jace-2014-06-27) I got to [preview](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/exclusive-magic-2015-preview-hushwing-gryff/), ton of cool cards have been revealed. Among them is [the Soul cycle](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/days-core-part-2-2014-06-30), where six different planes get cards to represent them, and powerful cards at that. The flavor here is great, which should please noted flavor aficionado and Hall of Famer Ben Stark, and the gameplay looks like it's going to match. This cycle is reminiscent of the [Titan cycle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&name=+[Titan]&set=+[%22Magic+2011%22]) from *Magic 2011*, and the Titans not only impacted Standard, they took it and turned it on its head.

 One of the remarkable things about the Titans was how each one got its time in the spotlight. Sure, [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) was overall the most dominant, but every Titan had at least some time where it was legitimately the best Titan in Standard (even [Frost Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan)). Let's take a look at the Souls and see if they can fill the (impressively giant) shoes left by the previous cycle:




![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/mm/2014/en_afvqwhtqoq_souls.jpg)
The first thing to note is how powerful each ability is. Starting with the baseline of a 6/6 with a keyword is good, but the activated ability is really the soul of each card, because that's the part of the card you are reliably getting. Granted, some keywords are better than others (flying over trample, for example), but the number one reason the Souls will see play is what they can activate for.



 Speaking of the activated abilities, those are how the Souls get to fight against all the removal they will inevitably be facing. The Titans got around removal by paying you off up front, and the Souls take the opposite approach. They don't give you anything the turn they are played, but you then get a one-shot use at any point later, and in uncounterable and instant-speed fashion. The realities of Constructed *Magic* being what they are, you really can't pay more than four mana for a card that doesn't match up well against removal, so the "play from the graveyard" clause on the Souls is critical to their upcoming success.



Looking at the commonly played removal in Standard, we have a mix of cards that looks something like this:



* [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall)
* [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade)
* [Devour Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+Flesh)
* [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price)
* [Rapid Hybridization](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rapid+Hybridization)
* [Cyclonic Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclonic+Rift)
* [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict)
* [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere)
* [Banishing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light)
* [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks)
