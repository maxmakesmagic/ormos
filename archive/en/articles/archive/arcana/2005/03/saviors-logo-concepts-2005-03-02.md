We've already [shown you](/en/articles/archive/saviors-kamigawa-logo-and-expansion-symbol-2005-02-03) the [logo](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=global/images/mtgcom_arcana_749_pic1_en.jpg) and [expansion symbol](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=global/images/mtgcom_arcana_749_pic2_en.jpg) for *Saviors of Kamigawa*, the Kamigawa block's final set, coming in June. Today we'd like to take a moment to go behind the scenes to show you some of the evolution of that *Saviors'* logo and symbol.

Here are preliminary logo designs and some packaging mockups based on them.



More packaging mockups with the logo finalized. Note even more ideas for expansion symbols here, and some interesting variations in background.
