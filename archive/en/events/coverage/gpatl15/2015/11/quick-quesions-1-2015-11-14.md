This weekend is more than just Grand Prix Atlanta; it’s the release weekend of *Commander 2015!*


StarCityGames celebrated the occasion by bringing in an all-star roster of Commander players and writers to Georgia to answer questions and, naturally, play Commander all weekend with Grand Prix attendees. We asked a few of them just what they’re most excited about from the release.

“The Golgari one [*Plunder the Graves*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/commander-2015-edition-decklists-2015-11-06) is super sweet. I like what it does, which is all about making a bunch of beefy creatures and, if they’re killed, reanimating them.”

“Meren of Clan Nel Toth. The Necromancer. I like to play black, but there wasn’t a mono-black deck so that’s the one I want. Then again, that’s the one my five-year-old wants, so they’ll probably win. That’s okay, Daxos The Returned has a better look and some spunk.”

“The white-black [Daxos the Returned](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daxos+the+Returned) deck. It’s no the most powerful but it is the most flavorful. Plus my first Commander deck was white-blue Daxos, so I’m looking forward to playing with the new version.”

“The red-white deck (*Wade into Battle).* It makes you think outside of the Boros box. Usually the Boros commanders want you to play aggressive small creatures, but this one wants you to play big creatures. It’s got my wheels turning, plus it has [Blade of Selves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+of+Selves).”
