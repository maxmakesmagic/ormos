All-Access Weeks, Plus Week of Super Qualifiers
-----------------------------------------------


Escape the January doldrums with a Week of Super Qualifiers starting Monday, January 18—one per day for an entire week! Each event offers TWO invitations to the *Kaldheim* Championship on *MTG Arena*.


*(For UTC, add 8 hours)*





| DATE | TIME (PT) | EVENT |
| Monday, January 18, 2021 | 10:00 a.m. | Modern Super Qualifier |
| Tuesday, January 19, 2021 | 3:00 p.m. | Pioneer Super Qualifier |
| Wednesday, January 20, 2021 | 5:00 a.m. | Standard Super Qualifier |
| Thursday, January 21, 2021 | 7:00 a.m. | Legacy Super Qualifier |
| Friday, January 22, 2021 | 2:00 p.m. | Modern Super Qualifier |
| Saturday, January 23, 2021 | 7:00 a.m. | Pauper Super Qualifier |
| Sunday, January 24, 2021 | 7:00 a.m. | Vintage Super Qualifier |


*Note: The Pauper and Vintage Qualifiers previously scheduled for that weekend have been replaced with Super Qualifiers in those formats.*


Got the cards already? Regular details of the event apply *(including minimum players and entry options of 40 Event Tickets, 400 Play Points, or 40 Qualifier Points)* and those can be [found here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2021).


Don't have the cards for your favorite format in your collection or want to try something new? Starting tomorrow, Mythic Event Tokens will be available in the MTGO store for $25.00.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/MTGO-Mythic_Generic.png)


* Purchasing a single Mythic Event Token provides access to almost every card in *Magic Online* *(except* Secret Lair*, MTGO-exclusive promos, and a few others)* and lets you: Test out new strategies in Open Play, Solitaire, and Commander
* Try new ideas to win prizes in Leagues and Queues *(normal entry option required)*
* Take on MTGO's best in Format Challenges and Showcase Challenges *(normal entry option required)*
* Enter a Super Qualifier *(normal entry option required)* or purchase a second Mythic Event Token and use both to enter

Please note:


* Spending Mythic Event Tokens doesn't remove All-Access—the access continues to apply to your account until downtime and lets you continue to build decks and enter Leagues, Tournaments, or additional Super Qualifiers with the regular entry options.
* Unused Mythic Event Tokens will be cleared from accounts during the downtime on January 27.

The Mythic Event Token goes on sale tomorrow at 10 a.m. Pacific (18:00 UTC) for $25.00, and enhanced access lasts until the next scheduled downtime—Wednesday, January 27, at 9:00 a.m. Pacific (17:00 UTC).

Spotlight Cube Series: *Temur Cube*
-----------------------------------


The next event in the Spotlight Cube Series comes to MTGO this week! Packed with tons of combos and potential degeneracy to be had, *Temur Cube* comes to *Magic Online* this Wednesday, January 13, and lasts for a full week. Cube designer Elizabeth Rice has more on *Temur Cube*, as well as a full card list, available in the announcement article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/spotlight-cube-series-temur-cube-2021-01-11).

Showcase Challenge Weekend
--------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend. These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and a Split Championship invitation.


First up on Saturday, January 16, we have the Standard (6 a.m. PT), Modern (8 a.m. PT), and Vintage (10 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Then on Sunday, January 17, we finish off with the Pioneer (6 a.m. PT), Legacy (8 a.m. PT), and *Zendikar Rising* Sealed (9 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in April.

*Vintage Cube* Ends Tomorrow

Updated Alternative Play Schedule

* January 20–28: ***Vintage Masters* Flashback**. One of the most popular Draft formats of all time is back to round out *Zendikar Rising* season. We'll have a little more than a week of that, and then . . . well, it's not quite time to talk about *Kaldheim* just yet.
