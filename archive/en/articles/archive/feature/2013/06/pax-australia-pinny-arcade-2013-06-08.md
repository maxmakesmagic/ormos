At PAX East this year, the folks over at Penny Arcade introduced "Pinny Arcade" which is their pin trading program at their conventions. We were proud to be [among the first batch](/en/articles/archive/magic-pax-east-2013-03-14) of pins created, with a Mike Krahulik drawn Chandra head.

But this year Penny Arcade is also launching [PAX Australia in Melbourne](http://aus.paxsite.com/) from July 19-21, 2013. And guess what, we've got another awesome Pinny Arcade pin!

We'll be releasing more information about our plans at PAX Australia in the coming weeks, if you're going to be there be sure to check back!
