What's that you say? You say you can't decide if you want to go to the [*Conflux* Prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases)? Even though there are not only [events all over the world](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-facts) but also [thirty large Prereleases](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-regional) for people who want to experience a big event?

Well, it's your decision, of course. We wouldn't want to *influence* you in any way. We just thought we’d mention (in a casual, offhand manner) that everyone who plays in a Prerelease will get one of these:
