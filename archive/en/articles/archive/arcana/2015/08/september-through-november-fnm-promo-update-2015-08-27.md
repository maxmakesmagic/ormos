The month is nearly over, so once again it's time to take a trip in our Friday Night *Magic* time machine and see what promos we have in store for the coming months.


**September**


We're far from done with Dragons, and this sturdy Bird Monk, [Orator of Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orator+of+Ojutai)—the Dragoniest [Wall of Omens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens) ever—reminds us why. You'll be able to get your copy come September, whether you choose to employ Dragons or some other inferior creatures to do so.

What's in the bag? WHAT'S IN THE BAG?!?!


The spookiest month gets a spooky upgrade to [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) with new art by Scott Murphy. Look away if you're squeamish, because John Doe has the upper hand.
