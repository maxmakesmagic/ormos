It wasn't all that long ago that No. 4 Ben Stark made the Top 4 of Grand Prix Dallas/Ft. Worth with a mostly white Orzhov Aggro deck.


Just four months, actually. And since then the deck has even received the gift of [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) as well as [Spirit of the Labyrinth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+of+the+Labyrinth), if it wants yet. Yet despite Stark's success, despite [Brimaz](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos), absolutely no one is playing it.


No one except Pat Cox.

And it's not like Cox is doing poorly with it. He narrowly missed a Top 8 in Albuquerque—splashing red instead of black and finishing 9th for his trouble—and sits at 9-2 after 11 rounds this weekend, well on pace for Top 8 contention.


 


Still, crickets.


So let's do some learning on the latest incarnation of White Weenie.


The deck starts with its slate of imposing one-drops. With [Dryad Militant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Militant), [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon), and [Boros Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Elite), white has access to more quality one-drops than any other color, and two of them even actually do a thing besides attack and block. Militant's ability is rarely relevant, but Cox said [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon) randomly hoses some decks, especially those relying on [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere).


The quality of its two and three drops are pretty much unmatched as well. [Daring Skyjek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daring+Skyjek) is the weak link, but the deck actively wants to attack with as many creatures as possible, so it's often just a 3/1 flier for two mana. Just as important is its ability to attack through [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) even when grounded.


That third point of power is also why [Spirit of the Labyrinth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+of+the+Labyrinth) made the cut. Cox said the ability rarely matters, but the extra power is important for getting in damage and getting through [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid). Since multiple [Imposing Sovereign](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imposing+Sovereign)s are redundant, Cox simply replaced one with the newest addition to the white weenie pantheon.


Beyond that, Cox filled out the deck with [Brimaz](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) and [Banisher Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banisher+Priest). Cox hasn't been as impressed with [Brimaz](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) as he was originally, and actually claims it's about on power level with [Banisher Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banisher+Priest). Plus, he added, casting [Brimaz](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) on turn three against a [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) deck is just asking to get wiped out.


Additionally, the split between [Spear of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spear+of+Heliod) and [Ajani, Caller of the Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Caller+of+the+Pride) is mostly a function of the fact that Cox thinks Ajani is just better. The ultimate doesn't come into play often, but the first two abilities have been aces for the Channelfireball player.


But the real key to the deck, and the reason to play a White Weenie strategy instead of Black or Red aggro, is [Brave the Elements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brave+the+Elements).

"Brave does a lot of work," Cox said. "It's a [Falter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falter), it's a counterspell, it's a combat trick. It does everything."


 


You might have noticed that, so far, we haven't mentioned any black cards. First, be patient. Second, good eye!


You see, Cox has played the core of the deck splashing other colors—notably red—before, but came back to black for the sideboard cards. [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) helps against Monsters, [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) helps against things [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) helps against, and [Dark Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Betrayal) makes the Black Devotion deck slightly more palatable.


But the real star in Cox's mind is [Xathrid Necromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Necromancer), which is virtually impossible to beat for decks that have to kill things naturally. It's really only weak to [Anger of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods), a card no one is playing in Standard.


Speaking of cards no one is playing, Cox only feels comfortable playing the deck because Black Devotion decks have left [Shrivel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrivel) and [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow) at home. Were they to come back, or were [Anger of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods) to become a thing, he'd have to change his tune.


But for now, Cox is pretty happy to play against pretty much anything except Mono Black Devotion, and even that match can be close with [Dark Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Betrayal).


So with another strong finish in sight for Cox, only one question remains:


Why aren't you playing it?
