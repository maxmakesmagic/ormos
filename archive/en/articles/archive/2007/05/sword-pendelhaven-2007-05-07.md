[Sword of the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+the+Meek) might look familiar.


As you may have read in [Magic Arcana #1294](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1294), the same sword is depicted in the art of both [Krosan Grip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Grip) and [Return to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Return+to+Dust) from *Time Spiral*.

*Future Sight's* [Sword of the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+the+Meek) solves the puzzle of how the same sword can be "disenchanted" multiple times.


Check out the artâ€”you'll see that Franz Vohwinkel illustrated that same sword yet again for a piece of equipment that has the power to come back from the graveyard.

The weapon grants a [Pendelhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven)-like +1/+2 enhancement and has a [Pendelhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven)-like affinity for 1/1 creatures. Who first bore this sword? Why, it's [Pendelhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven) protector Jacques Le Vert.

*Abandoning his sword to return to the lush forest of Pendelhaven, Jacques le Vert devoted his life to protecting the creatures of his homeland.*
