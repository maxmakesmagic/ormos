### Allen Wu



![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/gpalb16/t8_wu.jpg)



**Age:** 22




**Occupation:** Student




**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Won some PTQs on *Magic Online*




**What colors did you play in Sealed Deck on Day 1? What cards most impressed you**?



Started Blue-Red, but I should have played Blue-Black-Green and I sideboarded into it most rounds. [Traverse the Ulvenwald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traverse+the+Ulvenwald) was surprisingly strong. I thought it would just search up a land, but it ended up being much better than that. So much so that I second picked it in a Draft today.



**What did you play in the first Draft of Day 2? What cards most impressed you?**



Blue-Black. Most cards performed as expected. [Pore Over the Pages](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pore+Over+the+Pages) was the one that stood out. I expected it to be good and it was great.



**What did you play in the second Draft of Day 2? What cards most impressed you?**



Black-Green-White. [Sage of Ancient Lore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+of+Ancient+Lore). Again, I thought it would be good and it was great.



**What is your favorite Limited rare, uncommon, and common in *Shadows over Innistrad*? Why?**



[Morkrut Necropod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morkrut+Necropod) just because I've played it a lot and it's carried me a ton.
