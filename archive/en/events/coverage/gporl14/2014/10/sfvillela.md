The players were both full of smiles as they settled in for this semifinal. Hwang had dispatched Harry Corvese in the quarterfinals, while Villela had edged out Frank Lepore. He didn't seem confident of making it past this penultimate hurdle – 'I have no idea how I won my quarterfinal'. Hwang wasn't buying it – 'But you're still here.' The Brazilian was running a straight green-white deck, and in truth it wasn't pretty. You couldn't say the same for Hwang – his Mardu deck looked odds-on favorite to reach the final. But, as they say, there's a reason you play the games...



**Game 1**




 Against the aggressive Hwang (in the deck sense only!), Villela had lots of early defense, featuring a regenerating [Kin-Tree Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Warden) and two [Alpine Grizzly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpine+Grizzly). He turned one of his dead bears into Delve fodder for Hooting Mandrils, and kept on expanding his board. It wasn't that any of the cards were outstanding, it was just that they were nigglingly efficient. With the board state effectively stalled, Outlast could come into play. [Tuskguard Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tuskguard+Captain) grew and grew. And grew.




 You may be wondering what Hwang was doing through all this durdly green white excitement. The truthful answer? Plenty, but none of it especially noteworthy. Yes he got to turn up a couple of morphs, yes he got to use [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury) to kill a [Kin-Tree Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Warden), and, yes, [Ponyback Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback+Brigade) brought along some friends for the ride. None of it was really doing anything.
