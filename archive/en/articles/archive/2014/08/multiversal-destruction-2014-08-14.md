Before working at Wizards of the Coast, I liked to imagine that mass-destruction spells like [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) and [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) were designed by wide-eyed members of R&D who made explosion noises with their mouths while ramming toy cards together and stomping on that cool Lego house you totally thought was awesome.



Since starting here, I've learned that's not true. Mostly.



But to find out what developers were actually thinking when developing cards that explode all the things, I traveled through the Multiverse searching for comments on many of the game's most annihilating cards—starting with *From the Vault: Annihilation*'s namesake.



Decree of Annihilation



supercycle

Why, yes it is a super cycle.



Okay, so many of the cards in *Annihilation* are old enough that Multiverse comments are a bit slim. Still, several cards did have some interesting commentary to go along with their development.



Cataclysm



WJ: Constructed card.  




![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cataclysm)

[Cataclysm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cataclysm) ended up being one of the most powerful cards in *Exodus*, even with the increased cost. It was probably a bit better than tier 2, as Matt Linde used four copies in his White Weenie deck to win US Nationals back in 1998. [Empyrial Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empyrial+Armor) on one of Linde's two-drops followed by [Cataclysm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cataclysm) was usually game over back then.



Child of Alara



Del 5/6: Confirm mandatory?  




![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Child of Alara)

The mandatory bit was in reference to making it a "may" ability, which they clearly opted against. Making this legendary meant that playing two copies would make the world explode.



Fracturing Gust



AF 5/19: Was sorcery.  




![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fracturing Gust)

Persist was one of the mechanics in that set. Aaron Forsythe, ladies and gentlemen! Note that the cost was changed to differentiate it from [Austere Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command). As a result, [Fracturing Gust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fracturing+Gust) has become one of the premier ways to punish artifact-based decks like Affinity.



Martial Coup



MT 7/8: Now Rare, and better worded.  

KEN 7/21/2008: Doubling Season-matters!  

Del 7/25: Doubling Season no longer matters. Sync'ed up with the others.


![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Martial Coup)

[Doubling Season](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) kind of still matters, but originally the number of tokens, rather than the value of X, was what triggered the destruction of all other creatures. The actual wording lined up with the other spells of this nature and made [Doubling Season](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) matter a bit less.



Terminus



DH 3/30: And back to just W after more testing. Expect this to change back and forth. Eager for feedback on this.  

DG 4/11: I still enjoy a Wrath miracle, I have no specific preference on its hosing of graveyard strategies.  

DH 4/11: 3WW->4WW  

MJ 5/24: Miracle cost of W seems too splashable for such a dramatic effect



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Terminus)

[Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) ended up being a card in a pretty sweet spot—good enough for Standard but not format warping, but also different enough that it made an impact on Legacy. Seems like the developers got the costs just about right.



That's all for *From the Vault: Annihilation* spells, but while cruising through Multiverse, I did find this fantastic exchange on the "new" [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment), as well as [Planar Cleansing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Cleansing).



Day of Judgment



MR 1/14/09: Four mana mass creature removal in white—can we do this?  

KEN 1/14/2009: Mossbridge Troll goes RAWR!!  

TML 1/16/2009: hehe @ MR



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Day of Judgment)

Mark Rosewater, ladies and gentlemen!



Planar Cleansing



AF 7/25: New.  

DAL 7/25: I like this design and cost. Adds more main deck disenchants, and stops wrath players from hiding behind their enchantments, artifacts, and Planeswalkers while they wrath people. I like the three W's too.  

KEN 7/30/2008: Yay!  

AJ 7/28: This is great. Also, KEN seems to be time-travelling.  

ND 7/28: For a card that destroys creatures, this card is decidedly pro-creature. I like.



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Planar Cleansing)

Besides Ken's trip through time, there's some pretty fantastic soothsaying going on in here, as some of the comments portend Ivan Floch's victory at [Pro Tour *Magic 2015*](/events/coverage/ptm15), where he definitely did not hide behind any enchantments or artifacts, and only a few Planeswalkers.
