The competition was brutal at Grand Prix Santiago, but rising above all else were Green-based decks. The combination of good two-drops and big finishers helped Green stomp over everyone else. This is clearly represented by the first two of our Top 5 Cards of Grand Prix Santiago.

**Card #1: Somberwald Alpha**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Somberwald+Alpha)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somberwald+Alpha)
[Somberwald Alpha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somberwald+Alpha) overperformed in the Top 8, especially in the finals in the hands of Rodrigo Lopez against Tomoharu Saito. The wolf ensured that the blocking was a raw deal and that damage would get through. The +1/+1 ability was the icing on a very deadly cake.

**Card #2: Joraga Invocation**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Joraga+Invocation)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joraga+Invocation)
Even an underpowered [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) is still an [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun). The battle between Martin Quiroga and Rodrigo Lopez in the Semifinals was a race to [Joraga Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joraga+Invocation) - with Quiroga possibly losing because he pulled the trigger too soon. Still, it closed out a huge number of games over the weekend, pushing into one of the Top 5 cards.

**Card #3: Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chandra%2C+Fire+of+Kaladesh)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Fire+of+Kaladesh)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chandra%2C+Roaring+Flame)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Roaring+Flame)Transform
Both undefeated players from Day 1, Jorge Guerra and Christian Flores had [Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Fire+of+Kaladesh) in their decks. One of the most aggressive Planeswalkers, she serves as an inevitable conclusion both in a damage race, and when the board stalls out. Though we didn't get to see the combination with [Chandra's Ignition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Ignition) (another card proven powerful over the weekend) she was still a key player in the Sealed portion.

**Card #4:Â Reave Soul**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reave+Soul)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reave+Soul)
In an aggressive format such as Origins, the ability to slow your opponent right down on Turn 2 is critical for control decks, and [Reave Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reave+Soul) is the best tool in the format for doing so. The ability to hit a renowned [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade) or [Undercity Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undercity+Troll) (if the opponent is tapped out, of course) makes this card so important for decks that want to play the long game.

**Card #5: Suppression Bonds**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Suppression+Bonds)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suppression+Bonds)
Though 4 mana is a lot, it's one of the few cards that can deal with virtually any creature in the format (let's pretend [Gaea's Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Revenge) doesn't exist for a second). Considering that most White decks want to play creatures on Turns 2 and 3, then ensure they get through from then on, the casting cost isn't that troublesome. A well balanced card for the Origins Limited environment.
