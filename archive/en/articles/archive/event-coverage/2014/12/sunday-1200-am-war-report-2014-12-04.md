Midday is here and its time for the War Report! Nine rounds of intense play has elapsed and only three more rounds are left to go.


At the top of the standings and practically locked in the Top 8 are Yu Chao (24 points) and hot favorite, Jia Bin (24 points), both at 8-1 records, with Jin Yikai (22 points) close behind.


A handful of familiar names are still in contention and I see Xu Bin, Gao Tan and Zhao Haotian lurking amongst several others with 7-2 records. Lu Jia Chong, also at 21 points, happens to be the Nationals Team Alternate last year and is looking break into the Top 8 as well.


In just a couple of hours time, the Top 8 will be set. All right, back to the battlefield!
