![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpkl02/a971.jpg)On or off the dance floor, there's no stopping Tsuyoshi "Mr. Rolly" Fujita. The celebrated Invitationalist first rose to the public eye as the Finalist at Pro Tour - Tokyo, the first Japanese player to make a Pro Tour Top 8. In the months that followed, he was dogged by a string of poor finishes, dismissed as a one-hit wonder. He's since pulled himself back together, evidenced by his fourteenth place finish at Pro Tour - Osaka. He hopes his good fortune will continue this weekend.

Fujita was less than wowed by the contents of his first pack. He saw [Flame Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Burst), [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) and [Second Thoughts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts). He looked briefly at [Cartographer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartographer) and [Psionic Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift), but couldn't resist the pull of [Second Thoughts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts).

The next was more to his liking. [Krosan Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Avenger), [Elephant Ambush](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Ambush) and [Muscle Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst) were exactly the sort of cards he wanted. He took the Ambush without even considering [Afflict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict). He followed up with [Muscle Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst) over [Demoralize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demoralize) in a pretty thin pack. Then came [Krosan Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Avenger), letting another [Afflict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict) through.

He was almost swayed by [Ember Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Beast) at this point, but [Krosan Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Archer) let him take a strong card and not stray from his main color. Next was [Cartographer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartographer). Fujtia's insistence on staying out of red became clear as he sent [Rites of Initiation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Initiation) on its way in favor of [Timberland Ruins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberland+Ruins). As the packs wound down, [Rites of Refusal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Refusal) made the cut, intimating that he would go green-blue.

On his left, Liang had been taking all the red that Fujita had ignored, supplementing it with what green he could find. On the other side, Zhou had opened [Iridescent Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iridescent+Angel) and never looked back, drafting blue-white even though the card quality was not all the way there. So Fujita was in a bit of a tough spot. For the next pack he'd face a shortage of green, and in Torment he'd have his best blue stripped.

Things looked up a bit in pack two. Fujita started with [Nantuko Disciple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Disciple) over [Cephalid Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter), hoping it was a sign of things to come. The next had everything he didn't want. [Dwarven Strike Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Strike+Force), [Morbid Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger), [Kirtar's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kirtar%27s+Desire) and [Flame Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Burst). Luckily, it also had [Repel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repel), and he took that.

Fanning out the next pack he sighed audibly. There were no green cards. The only blue card was [Psionic Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift). He looked at [Millikin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin), but chose [Aven Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock) instead. Assuming the worst, he was pleasantly surprised when he was shipped [Cephalid Broker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Broker). He had to double-check to make sure it was the real deal.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpkl02/a972.jpg)Knowing his curve was high, Fujita nonetheless took [Scrivener](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrivener) over [Cephalid Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Scout). The packs began to fail him. He took [Aven Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Archer), and then [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study). Another [Scrivener](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrivener) mocked his earlier choice. He could only shake his head as he wrapped things up with [Shelter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter) and [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari). He needed a miracle.

Torment was not kind. Fujita started out with [Ghostly Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Wings) over [Balshan Collaborator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balshan+Collaborator), then [Stupefying Touch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stupefying+Touch) over [Acorn Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acorn+Harvest). [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) got a smile out of him, and [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) as well, but it was looking like Fujita just wouldn't have a way to win. He let a [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) go by in favor of [Far Wanderings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Far+Wanderings), presumably a nod to the three-color necessity he faced. A few green bodies showed up, but too many of them were [Krosan Restorer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Restorer)s.

Spread out, the deck's weaknesses were laid bare. No creatures before three mana. Few way to break out of a stall. And three colors on top of that. Fujita did what he could, but admitted that 0-3 was an all-too real possiblity with this pile.
