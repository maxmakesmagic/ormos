Plenty of people love **Magic**... but not all of them love it enough to write and perform a song about it!

Here's a letter we got recently from Steve Wolf, who did exactly that with his (get this) combination play group / barbershop quartet. Below the letter you'll find a video of Steve's group performing the song, along with the lyrics. Enjoy!

I've been a **Magic** player since *Revised*. I'm also a very active barbershop singer! A few months ago I taught the guys in my quartet to play and they've all caught the bug too. Last weekend we got together for a rehearsal and ended up playing A LOT. At about 3 in the morning over a game of Two-Headed Giant we starting making up a parody to "Come Fly With Me" about our game. Hence the line about Guile not having flying (that surprised our bass singer when he played itâ€”he assumed it did 'cause the picture had wings, then felt like a dork when he actually read the card, haha).

Anyway, half an hour later we finished and recorded a video to put on YouTube so we could send it to you guys. Hope you like it!

Steve Wolf  
 Connecticut **Magic** player, barbershopper, and musician

Hey here's what's on my mind  
 Lets you and me unwind  
 So grab your cards and  
 Well have a real good time!  
 Yeah yeah yeah  
  
 It's **Magic** time  
 It's time for us to play! (let's go and play)  
 A PTQ is the place for you  
 And for me to be all day.  
 The tournament  
 Will soon be underway (it's underway)  
  
 If Faerie decks  
 Have really got you down (don't frown)  
 A [Firespout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout) will be your way out  
 And you may just win this round  
 And [Sarkhan Vol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Vol)  
 Will make your name renowned! (make it renowned)  
  
 Would someone please tell me  
 Why the card named [Guile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guile) can't fly?  
 He's got wings!!  
 Uh-tell me  
 Why oh why?  
 But when there's a new set  
 And the Prerelease is near  
 You will hear  
 Players cheer, "This game is awesome!"  
  
 Count your lands  
 Try not to overpay (o-o-verpay)  
 We all can learn  
 From some mana burn  
 As we tap the hours away  
 The artwork and mechanics  
 Make us shout "Hooray!"  
  
 So grab your cards  
 Come on its time to PLAY  
 Come on guys lets end the song  
 Time for  
**Magic** all DAY!
