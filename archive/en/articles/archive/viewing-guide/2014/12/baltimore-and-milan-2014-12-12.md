The [StarCityGames.com](http://www.StarCityGames.com/) Open Series is celebrating a big weekend in Seattle.

The SCG Open circuit's top players are in the final stretch to grab one of the few remaining slots in the Players' Championship taking place next weekend.



With a $50,000 prize purse and two guaranteed slots to the Players' Championship up for grabs, who will come out on top at the end of the weekend? Will it be one of the juggernauts: Tom Ross, Reid Duke, or Brad Nelson? What about SCG Open Series mainstays like Chris Vanmeter, Ross Merriam, or Brian Braun-Duin?
