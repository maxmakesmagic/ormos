**#5 Blood Moon**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blood+Moon)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon)


The last few weeks have witnessed the ascent of the big-mana decks in Red-Green Tron and Amulet Bloom, and that gave way to a [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) rising.


Almost every deck that could ran the Moon in Charlotte, with some decks — like finalist Wesley See’s Blue-Red [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) deck — going so far as to main deck the game-changing enchantment.


It certainly had a noticeable impact on the metagame. After the two decks comprised half of the Top 8 of last week’s StarCityGames.com Invitational, not a single one was found in the Top 8 in Charlotte. That’s no coincidence considering how many players found ways to cast [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon).

**#4 Spellskite**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spellskite)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite)


The best question to ask may be “what *can’t* [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) do?” From protecting the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combo, to disrupting the plans of an Infect deck, to saving a key creature to even just blocking (it’s an 0/4, after all), this little artifact does it all.


The fact that [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) is colorless — allowing anyone to play it — is just icing on an already-rich cake. [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) played a key role all weekend, especially in the finals, where Michael Malone used it first to prevent his opponent from completing the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combo and then to jump in front of a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and allow his Elves to swing for the victory.

**#3 Kolaghan's Command​**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kolaghan%27s+Command)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command)


Versatility is the name of the game when it comes to *Dragons of Tarkir’s* most-played Command. It has led to the resurgence of Jund and completely changed the face of control decks in Modern.


"[Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) has literally, single-handedly the thing that took Grixis up to being one of the defining decks of the format," said hall of famer Patrick Chapin, who navigated Grixis Control to a ninth-place finish. "The versatility, the fact that you can play with artifact removal main deck, the fact that it gives you so many good options and matches up so well with a lot of things people are doing in Modern, and it chains so well with [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage).”


Grand Prix Charlotte was a testament to the card’s strength, as it allowed players to destroy Aether Vial or [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor) while also serving as creature removal or buy back a lost [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) or [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) or even push through the last two points of damage. Whatever shell it found itself in, Kolaghan’s Command was a standout performer.

**#2 Collected Company**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Collected+Company)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company)


[Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) is the card green decks didn’t know they needed until it arrived on the scene with *Dragons of Tarkir.*


The number of decks that [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) not just fits into — but makes possible by itself — is staggering. From the Elves deck that won the event to the combo decks that used it to find their key pieces to aggressive decks like Paul Rietzl and Matt Sperling’s that used it as a brute force 2-for-1, [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) made its claim on the Modern format in Charlotte.


Sperling summed it up best.


"If you're playing creatures that synergize with each other, it turns out you can not only get a critical mass of creatures that are hard to kill on a 1-for-1 basis, but you can also try and find the creature or two in your deck that you need for the combo," the Pro Tour *Magic 2015* Top 8 competitor said. "You can do creative things with it, or you can do synergistic things with it, or you can get just a raw power two-for-one with it."

**#1 Roast**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Roast)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roast)


  

When *Fate Reforged* hit Modern at the Pro Tour, both [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) led the way. While both are colorful ways to gain an advantage they shared another feature that made them problematic to the Modern of the past: 5 toughness.



Many decks, from the varieties of [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin)-packing combos to the rising-again Jund menace to the flavors of Control using red, swapped [Roast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roast) in as an answer. *Dragons of Tarkir*’s Limited tool has emerged as one of the effective ways to handle the array of threats on the ground. While losing out to [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) on speed, [Roast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roast) more than made up for being a sorcery by dishing out five damage at a time to creatures. While *Fate Reforged*’s standouts were one of the reasons, incidentally destroying [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite)s and other tough creatures put it to work in almost any matchup.


That’s exactly what it did for Wesley See in his semifinal showdown against Andrew Wagoner.
