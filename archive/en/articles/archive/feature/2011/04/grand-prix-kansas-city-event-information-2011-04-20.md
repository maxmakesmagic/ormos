![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/promo/grandprix_2011.jpg)*Get your free promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).* The Grand Prix circuit returns to Kansas City, landing at the familiar Crown Center which hosted U.S. Nationals in both 2004 and 2009. We’ll have events from casual to competitive all weekend long, and if you’re looking for a little fun outside of the venue, the Crown Center is located just minutes from the vibrant Power and Light district. 


Three amazing artists highlight the activities in Kansas City: Eric Deschamps, Daarken, and Missouri’s own Dan Scott! Current **Magic: The Gathering** developer and former pro player Zac Hill is coming out to spellsling and he’s bringing local-boy-turned-Wizards-employee Ryan Miller back home with him.


 In addition to the promotional Maelstrom Pulse, attendees will receive a “North American Grand Prix Tour” deck box (while supplies last). This box is printed and designed by Legion Supplies and is the fifth in a series of eight being given away at North American Grand Prix in 2011. These deck boxes are customized with Steve Argyle art along one panel so that when all eight are collected and placed side by side, they create a full eight-piece mural. Additionally, players in Public Events will receive limited-edition storage boxes perfectly sized for holding four of the Grand Prix deck boxes (while supplies last).


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#1).*
