The world of *Khans of Tarkir* is no more, replaced by a world of dragons. Dragons, like the one on this token.

I mean, come on, you didn't think we'd put out the dragoniest set that ever dragoned with no Dragon tokens, did you?



Of course, there are other tokens as well. The Dragon token is merely the biggest and dragoniest. We've already revealed [how you can make those Dragon tokens yesterday](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/developing-dragons-tarkir-2015-03-09), but the sources of some of these tokens haven't yet been revealed.



Curiosity piqued? Good! That's sort of the point.



You can check out the sources of some of these tokens on the [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/dragonsoftarkir). As for the rest? You'll just have to stay tuned.
