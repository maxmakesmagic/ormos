Both these players are no strangers to the limelight. Andre Müller made it to the Top 8 of two Pro Tours, once in Philadelphia in 2005 and in Valencia in 2007, while Denis Sinner got his sole PT Top 8 in Berlin in 2008. Both took some time away from the PT, but are currently working on their comeback and have qualified for the upcoming PT Philly.


For this event, Müller chose blue-black control, whereas Sinner brought [Caw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caw)-[Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade).



### Game One



Müller took a mulligan. "Huh. I had the exact same cards," Müller said. "Only one more. Guess, I'll take another mulligan."


As he shuffled, he mused: "You're pretty far ahead then already."


Sinner offered a shrug and muttered something along the lines of "Kind of."


"Nah, I heard, in the end, the best player always wins. There really is no luck in **Magic**," said Müller and stuck out his tongue. He kept his five cards.

Sinner started fast, with [Mirran Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader) and another [Mirran Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader) followed by [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine). Müller bought some time with [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum), but quickly succumbed to the black-protected masses.


"Yeah, I heard that's how you win this match-up: double-mulligan for your opponent. double [Mirran Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader) for you, plus [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine)." Quite the beating indeed.

### Game Two



Müller had [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) for Sinner's [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), leaving him with [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) in hand. Sinner made his [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and reached for his library to resolve the spell. "That's right. When I have [Mental Misstep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep), you will instantly know it, because I'll sit on the edge of my chair waiting to stop you from resolving your spell," Müller joked.


Müller's [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) was stopped by another [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), Sinner's [Mirran Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader) met the same fate. Next, Sinner resolved [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), but Müller didn't even have to resolve his two [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit)s. The lands attacked twice and took [Gideon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon) down. Since this had worked so well, Müller shrugged and simply continued in this line of play. His Tar Pits smashed in for 6, 6, 6 ... and the rest.


**Andre Müller 1 – 1 Denis Sinner**



### Game Three



The action started on turn four, when Sinner tried for [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) which, much to Müller's chagrin, resolved and searched up two more.


The [Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hawk) attacked and was joined by [Mirran Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader) after the players had traded [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s to stop and save the [Crusade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusade)r, respectively.

Müller cast [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), seeing three more [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s as well as two copies of [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura). "But no more land, huh?" Müller said as he used his Tectomnic Edge to keep Sinner off five mana.


Still, [Mirran Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader) and two [Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hawk)s put Müller on the clock. On 8 life, Müller used a kicked [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) on [Mirran Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader) during Sinner's end step. Three [Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hawk)s brought Müller down to 5. During this turn's end step, Müller cast [Consume the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek), but Sinner had the [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak).


Müller summoned [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), passed the turn, and fell to 3 life, while Sinner re-cast his [Mirran Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader). "Best top deck ever, now please?" Müller knocked on the top of his deck. [Black Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) or [Consume the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek) were just about the only cards which could help him out of this particular pickle. He did't draw either and extended his hand in concession


**Andre Müller 1 – 2 Denis Sinner**
