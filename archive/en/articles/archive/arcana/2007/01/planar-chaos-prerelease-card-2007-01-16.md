We recommend you find a good, solid chair for when you build your sealed deck, because once you start spreading out those cards, the world is going to seem a little wobbly already.

The *Planar Chaos* prerelease: Leave your expectations at the door. (Look for the convenient expectation-receptacle near the main entrance of a venue near you.)

It’s time to reveal the prerelease card, so get set:
