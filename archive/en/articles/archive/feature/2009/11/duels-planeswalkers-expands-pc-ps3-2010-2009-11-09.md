[![Duels of the Planeswalkers](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/feature43c_dotpLogo.jpg)](/en/articles/archive/mtgdigitaldotpwhatis-2008-12-09-0)Are you ready to take your **Magic: The Gathering – Duels of the Planeswalkers** experience to a higher level? You'll be able to do just that in 2010 as Wizards of the Coast will launch two more expansion packs plus extend the game to PC and PlayStation 3.

[**Duels of the Planeswalkers**](/en/articles/archive/mtgdigitaldotpwhatis-2008-12-09-0) continues to be one of the most downloaded games on Xbox LIVE Arcade. On the heels of the first expansion released in October, the 2010 expansions are scheduled for spring and summer of next year. Similar to the first expansion, the two releases will feature new cards, planeswalkers, and challenges, and will be offered in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and German.

Also planned for the summer of 2010 is the release of the PC version of **Duels of the Planeswalkers**. The PC version will offer the same style of gameplay as the XBLA title, along with an extra bonus we can't tell you about quite yet.

The 2010 plan continues into the fall with the release of **Duels of the Planeswalkers** on PlayStation 3. The PS3 version will be available in Japanese in 2011.
