*What's your favorite Mirrodin Besieged card, and why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kennethnagle.jpg)**Ken Nagle:** My favorite *Mirrodin Besieged* card is [Blightsteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus).

First of all, as a fan of culling rotten produce, bankrupting unsuccessful businesses, and rewarding excellence, I'm on the Phyrexian side of the war.

Second, nothing says, "You do NOT want to mess with those villains!" like corrupting the iconic weapon from the previous *Mirrodin* block.

Third, I like fatties.

I will attest, I lost sleep the day [Blightsteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus) entered the design file. I lay awake thinking,

"Can we print this card?"  
 "Should we print this card?"  
 "What happens when we print this card?"

I've worked on all **Magic** sets in some capacity since *Lorwyn*, so I know that when a card keeps me awake at night, that card is doing something right.

[Blightsteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus) isn't about game balance, math, or fairness. It's about pure ownage.

This is war. Whose side are you on?
