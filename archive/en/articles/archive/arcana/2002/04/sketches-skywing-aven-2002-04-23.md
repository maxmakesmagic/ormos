Today's card is [Skywing Aven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywing+Aven), a blue *Torment* common, illustrated by [Matt Cavotta](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/feature/28). 

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This card should show a bird warrior charging into battle with arrows passing harmlessly through him. The bird warrior is becoming intangible."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Matt. The arrows are passing through the aven (although the bird in the corner is not as lucky).

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final piece. Matt decided that the arrows looked like they were sticking through the aven, implying that he was wounded as opposed to impervious to damage. So he switched the arrows for a bolt of lightning. Now it is easy to see that the aven is avoiding being struck.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today, lightning and all.
