Welcome to "Behind the Card", where we look at what's going on in one of your favorite cards [\*](#footnote1). Today, [Earwig Squad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earwig+Squad). Go!


### Artist Portfolio


[Warren Mahy](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=Warren%20Mahy&Field_Artist=on&setfilter=All%20sets) is a fairly new **Magic** artist, debuting in *Guildpact* with Blind Hunter and Exhumer Thrull and illustrating nineteen cards in *Lorwyn* and *Morningtide*.


### Art Description


Here's the description that was given to Warren for [Earwig Squad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earwig+Squad) (which was called "Earwigger Squad" at the time)


Color: Black creature  

Location: marsh  

Action: Show 2 or 3 boggarts bounding through their marsh home. Each of them carries an "earwigger," a boggart device of your design used to insert an earwig insect into an unsuspecting victim's ear. It should look simple enough that a dimwitted boggart could build it, yet creepy for the victim. Perhaps we see extra earwigs climbing on the boggarts, or used as jewelry.  

Focus: The boggarts  

Mood: The earwigger squad is on the prowl -- horrible pranks are afoot


### Sketch


Warren focuses on the rampaging boggarts with the bugs (mostly) captured at the ends of their poles.

### Final Art


In the final art, the attitudes of the boggarts has changed a little. The lead boggart seems more crazed, while the one in the back has that touch of eagerness that you like to see in your rampaging band of brain-eating-bug-wielders. You know a bug is bad news when even the frogs give it a wide berth!

### Card


And here's the final product. Now that you know the whole story, it's kind of gross, isn't it?
