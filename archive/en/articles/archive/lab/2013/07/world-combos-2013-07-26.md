Hello, and welcome to the Lab. The **Magic** World Championship is this week, and in a few days all eyes will be turned to the big stage as the best players in the world battle it out for the title. In honor of this tournament, I'll be putting together some fun combo decks based on cards from past World Championship decks. 

 In 2000, the world champion was none other than the great Jon Finkel. He fought his way to victory with the help of [Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), which produced plenty of mana to power up cards like [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) and [Phyrexian Processor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Processor), while tapping down his opponents' lands with [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) and [Mishra's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Helix).
