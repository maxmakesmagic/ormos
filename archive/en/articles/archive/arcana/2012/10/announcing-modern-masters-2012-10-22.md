Introducing...

![Magic: The Gathering Modern Masters Logo](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1086_logo_ac8o2dj9be.jpg)Use the hashtag [#mtgmm](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23mtgmm&src=typd) to discuss *Modern Masters* on Twitter.

"Okay," you're thinking. "But what exactly *is* this "Modern Masters"? Well, it's a 229-card set of reprinted cards. It's all cards that are Modern-legal, and the set is designed to be drafted. And for a full explanation and description, [Aaron Forythe has you covered](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/218). But perhaps you're more comfortable with bullet points?

* 229 Reprint Cards for the Modern Format, many with new art
* Cards are reprints from *Eighth Edition* through *Alara Reborn*
* New never before printed tokens
* 15-card booster packs, one premium per pack
* Designed to be drafted
* 24 packs per box
* $6.99 MSRP
* English only, global distribution
* Conservative print run

These cards won't be Standard-legal. But they *will* be tournament-legal in all formats where the original printing is legal. And what that means is that this card is going to be in booster packs that are hitting stores on June 7, 2013.
