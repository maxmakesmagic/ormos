Let's take a look at [Soliton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soliton), a 3/4 Artifact Creature from *Scars of Mirrodin*.

Normally at this point, we'd show you some previous 3/4 Artifact Creature that [Soliton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soliton) references. And today is no exception! It turns out that [Soliton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soliton) is a descendant of a card from *Darksteel*. In the distant past, [Soliton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soliton) was part of something that had four arms and four legs. But when it split in two, half of it got lost and half of it became [Soliton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soliton).
