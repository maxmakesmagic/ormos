After hundreds of Day 2 matches have concluded, I always like to run the numbers.


Here is the average number of match points gained during the Swiss rounds of the Sunday competition by pilots of the most represented archetypes:





|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
**Deck**
 | 
**Number of points**
 |
| Sidisi-Whip | 9.7 |
| Jeskai Wins | 9.7 |
| Temur Aggro | 9.6 |
| Mardu Midrange | 8.3 |
| Abzan Midrange | 8.0 |
| Abzan Aggro | 6.9 |


Here, 9 points would represent an average 3-3 record, or even slightly better than that because people drawing and dropping might reduce the overall point total a little bit.


What we learn from these numbers is that Sidisi-Whip, Jeskai Wins, and Temur Aggro all had an impressive performance this weekend. Abzan Aggro, on the other hand, didn’t do as well.


Next up, I have the matchup scores between the top four archetypes for you:





|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Abzan Midrange | Jeskai Wins | Mardu Midrange | Abzan Aggro |
| Abzan Midrange | X | 8-11 (42%) | 12-14 (46%) | 10-8 (56%) |
| Jeskai Wins | 11-8 (58%) | X | 16-8 (67%) | 8-5 (62%) |
| Mardu Midrange | 14-12 (54%) | 8-16 (33%) | X | 9-4 (69%) |
| Abzan Aggro | 8-10 (44%) | 5-8 (38%) | 4-9 (31%) | X |


The way to interpret these numbers is that, for example, Jeskai Wins beat Abzan Midrange 11 times and lost to Abzan Midrange 8 times over the course of Day 2. Hence, based on this data, it’s a 58% favorite in the matchup.


Although the sample size is small for some matchups, we get a strong indication that Jeskai has a great matchup against Mardu. Given that Mardu had risen in popularity this weekend, it’s a good explanation for why Jeskai had bounced back after its poor performance last weekend in LA.
