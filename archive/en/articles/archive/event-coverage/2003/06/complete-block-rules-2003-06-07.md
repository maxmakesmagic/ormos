The final format will be simple block constructed with only one difference. 

Decks will be *Onslaught/Legions* constructed with the addition of one other small expansion of the player's choice. The set must be one of the second-expansion sets released (or the final block expansion).

The 7 legal sets that may be choosen are:

*Alliances*  
*Weatherlight*  
*Exodus*  
*Urza's Destiny*  
*Prophecy*  
*Apocolypse*  
*Judgement*

Only cards from ONE of these above sets may be added to each deck. Decks will be 60-card minimum with a 15-card sideboard. Matches will be 2 out of 3 games.
