 First-class Hall of Famer Darwin Kastle has been playing **Magic** for a very, very long time. He was the designer of and featured in the first printed **Magic** Invitational card, [Avalanche Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders) from *Urza's Legacy*. He has eight Pro Tour Top 8s, including a win as a member of Team Your Move Games in Washington D.C. 1999 alongside fellow Hall of Famers Rob Dougherty and Dave Humphreys. Nowadays, Kastle's work as a game designer keeps him busy enough to prevent him from attending many Grand Prix weekends, but he still takes time out of his schedule to attend Pro Tours when he can.




 Nam Sung Wook is one of only two South Korean players here in Day Two of Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*. Alongside his countryman Jun Young Park, Nam has joined the ranks of Team MTG Mint Card, the Asian superteam featuring the likes of Lee Shi Tian, Tzu-Ching Kuo, Chapman Sim, and Kelvin Chew. Nam was the winner of Grand Prix Melbourne earlier this year, making him the first South Korean player to ever win a premier-level event. His presence on the already superb Team MTG Mint Card is already being felt, as it was the list he and Park tuned that the team opted to use as their deck for this event. Nam currently has a two-point lead on Park in the race for South Korean World **Magic** Cup captain, though he trails Lee Shi Tian by a decent 18-point margin for the APAC representative slot in the World Championship. A strong finish here at the Pro Tour has the potential to catapult him into the lead with only three months remaining in the season.






*Darwin Kastle, Hall of Famer and official [Avalanche Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders), is ready to battle against Nam Sung Wook, one of two South Korean players to make it into Day Two of this Pro Tour.*
