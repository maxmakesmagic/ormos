Sunday: 9.00am - Drafting with Yuuya Watanabe
---------------------------------------------


*by Chapman Sim*

Despite dropping a spot on this week's Top 25 Rankings, 5th ranked player Yuuya Watanabe is still the highest ranked player in this tournament. After a decent 7-1-1 finish yesterday, Watanabe is in a good position to make his 20th Grand Prix Top 8.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gphk13/watanabedraft.jpg)*Yuuya Watanabe* 
### Booster One


Watanable first picked [Arbor Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus) over [Purphoros's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%27s+Emissary), and followed that up with [Nimbus Naiad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad) over [Staunch-Hearted Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staunch-Hearted+Warrior). [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) was an easy third pick out of a relatively weak booster.


It would seem like he was devoted to Blue and Green but when [Purphoros's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%27s+Emissary) and [Minotaur Skullcleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Skullcleaver) tabled, that was a sign that red was very underdrafted and Watanabe was happy to pick those up in case he ever wanted to switch gears.




![Arbor Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arbor+Colossus)

*Possibly the biggest dude in the format, unless you count [Colossus of Akros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Colossus+of+Akros).*

| 14 | Yoked Ox |

### Booster Two


Watanabe's seoncd booster wasn't spectacular, but it did have [Centaur Battlemaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Battlemaster). [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad) greeted him in the second booster, one of the best commons in the set. Knowing that red was underdrafted from the previous pack, Watanabe was glad to pick up [Ill-Tempered Cyclops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ill-Tempered+Cyclops) (forgoing a second copy of [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide)) and Bloodrage Shaman, before bolstering his army with [Deathbellow Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathbellow+Raider) and a second [Minotaur Skullcleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Skullcleaver) and solidifying himself in red green, expecting more red goodies to come along the way.

### Booster Three


The Gods were on his side (rather, the God was) and he was offered [Nylea, God of the Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%2C+God+of+the+Hunt) in his third booster which would go well with the [Arbor Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus) and [Centaur Battlemaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Battlemaster) he already had. The fourth pick presented him with [Anthousa, Setessan Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anthousa%2C+Setessan+Hero) versus [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad), and he eventually decided with the bestow creature since he was low on 2-drops.



![Nylea, God of the Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nylea%2C+God+of+the+Hunt)

With [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) and [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) in his pool, he contemplated 5th picking [Horizon Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Chimera) for a blue splash and eventually decided to go for it, passing a [Portent of Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Portent+of+Betrayal) that he would have otherwise taken. [Destructive Revelry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Revelry) gave him the full suite of enchantment removal spells, ensuring that he should have no issues with enchantments and artifacts whatsoever.

"There was one point I took [Ill-Tempered Cyclops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ill-Tempered+Cyclops) over my second [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide). I think that was the turning point of the draft. If I had grabbed the second [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide), I would probably be playing blue and end up with an addition two or three more [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons)."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gphk13/draftdeck.jpg)*Yuuya Watanabe's Draft Deck* 
Having said that, he feels that he should have no problems with a 2-1 record, maybe even 3-0. "I have no pumps and no burn. So maybe I'll just try to make a huge guy and try to win with it."

Sunday, 10:00 a.m. - Czech Republic Draft Reflections
-----------------------------------------------------


*by Noel Neo*

"If you draft a slow deck, you leave yourself vulnerable to your opponent's bombs. You can have a very good deck and still simply lose to something like [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion). A fast deck allows you to close the game before opposing bombs come online. I don't try to force an aggressive build, but I do assign a slightly higher weighting to cards that fit in an aggressive deck prior to being committed to a strategy."


- Stanislav Cifka, 9th in the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings


Both Cifka and (16) Martin Juza say *Theros* Limited is very much more about deck synergies than absolute power levels. You need to know the archetype you are trying to draft and evaluate draft picks on how they contribute to your deck's strategy.


That said, efficient removal is at a premium in this format simply because of its scarcity. Cards like [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) and [Voyage's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End) go up in value owing to the lower removal count in *Theros* than in other sets. Even when drafting heroic themed decks, Cifka and Juza would pick removal ahead of creature enhancers because the enhancers can be picked up later in the packs.


Five toughness also becomes the magic number in this format because this brings the creatures out of range of removal like [Lash of the Whip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+of+the+Whip) and [Rage of Purphoros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rage+of+Purphoros). This is one of the reasons [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) is so good.


On specific picks, Juza likes [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr):


"It is unique in being the cheapest mana ramp in the format and the tempo advantage is hugely important. When you're the first to summon your large beaters and to go monstrous, it is much easier to push damage through."

*by Chapman Sim*

Our guest artist might be relatively new to illustrating for **Magic** but for the past 8 years he has worked as a senior concept artist for such games and film as Guild Wars, Lineage Forever, Battle Los Angeles, Mortal Kombat, and God of War III.

After bringing life to **Magic** for five years, Jung is here at his very first Grand Prix and he was greeted by a bittersweet surprise. "I literally signed over five thousand cards yesterday and my hands are dying," chuckled Jung. But that could only be a testament to the popularity of his artwork, as well as the enthusiasm of rabid fans.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gphk13/Playmat.jpg)*Jung Park and a [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) playmat.* 
"[Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) was hands down the most popular card," and it was not difficult to understand why. The fact that the Legendary Land had dominated at recently-concluded Pro Tour *Theros* probably contributed to it's extreme popularity. In addition, the stunning piece was also used as the backdrop for Grand Prix Hong Kong's exclusive playmat, with a limited print run of only 800 copies worldwide!


[Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and [Hallowed Fountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain) were also really popular, as were cycle of full art *Zendikar* basics. Rumor has it that a player even requested him to autograph a whooping 150 of those. Jung shared with me that his specialty is in landscapes and scenery and enjoys working on them greatly.

"When I commissioned [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) for Wizards of the Coast, I had no idea that it was going to be used as the packaging artwork for *Modern Masters*." I can only assume that it is a great honor to have your artwork featured on one of the most premium products in the history of the game.

"I've never played the game due to my busy schedule but I really enjoyed my weekend here today. It was a refreshing change and I'm really happy to meet the community." I'm sure the attendees at Grand Prix Hong Kong were real happy to meet Jung Park too!

Round 10 Feature Match - Classic Attrition (5) Yuuya Watanabe vs. Taku Matsumura
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Noel Neo*

With both players at 7-1-1, a loss here would leave a spot in the Top 8 very much in the hands of tiebreakers even if all following matches are won.


Yuuya Watanabe, ranked 5th in the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings, is piloting a Red Green deck with a dash of minotaurs. He would need to seal the win against Taku's Green Black deck before Taku's card advantage engine grinds him out of the long game.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gphk13/r10_yuuya.jpg)*Yuuya trying to push damage.* 
Taku opened game one with the hallmark of his archetype, deathtouch creatures – [Baleful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Eidolon) and [Sedge Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedge+Scorpion), which traded with Destructive Relvery and Agent of the Horizone. This bought him the time needed to stabilise with [Reaper of the Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds) and get his card advantage engine online with [Read the Bones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones) and [Pharika's Mender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Mender).


Yuuya's next line of attack was to build out [Centaur Battlemaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Battlemaster) by taking down [Pharika's Mender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Mender) and [Vulpine Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulpine+Goliath) with consecutive [Time to Feed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+to+Feed). However, he had taken eight damage in the time needed to build out this game plan and was facing down [Reaper of the Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds) and a newly summoned [Nemesis of Mortals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis+of+Mortals).


With [Reaper of the Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds) having deathtouch and without a means of giving his Battlemaster evasion, Yuuya's best play at this point was to force the trade by bestowing [Purphoros's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%27s+Emissary) on his Battlemaster and attacking into the two creatures.


However, it was all for naught as Yuuya was spent and Taku simply rebuilt with [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) and multiple [Cavern Lampad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+Lampad) to take game one.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gphk13/r10_taku.jpg)*Taku in control of the game.* 
In game two, Yuuya stumbled when he missed his fourth land drop and opted to sacrifice [Satyr Hedonist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Hedonist) to fuel [Staunch-Hearted Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staunch-Hearted+Warrior) in a bid to take the game quickly. It would be the first nail in the coffin as Taku simply untapped and played [Pharika's Cure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure).


By turn five, Taku had [Felhide Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felhide+Minotaur) and [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) to a Yuuya's lone Ill [Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temper)ed Cyclops. Yuuya tried to stabilise with repeated [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad)s that met consecutive [Fade into Antiquity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fade+into+Antiquity), while the Asp proceeded to take chunks out of Yuuya's life total.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gphk13/r10_battlemaster.jpg)*Battlemaster Warcry.* 
In the end, the slower development of Yuuya's board proved fatal as he succumbed to a combination of creature mass and [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel).


### Taku Matsumura attrits (5) Yuuya Watanabe out of round 10 and advances 8-1-1.

Round 11 Feature Match - Heroic Maneuvers (7) Shuhei Nakamura vs. Shouta Yasooka
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Chapman Sim*

7th ranked Shuhei Nakamura is in search of yet another Top 8 appearance but he finds himself paired against fellow countryman Shouta Yasooka, a worthy opponent with an equally scary resume. Both players have a combined 37 Grand Prix Top 8 appearances between them, hot favorites to actually win this event. However, one of them would soon be eliminated from contention, while the victor would need to win out to secure a Top 8 berth. In the end, it was Shuhei Nakamura who emerged victorious, keeping his dreams alive.


### Game One


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gphk13/r11_yasooka.jpg)*Shouta Yasooka* 
Shouta Yasooka took game one by breaking past Shuhei Nakamura's [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite) and [Fabled Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero), using a combination of [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) and [Ordeal of Purphoros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Purphoros).

| 
Favored Hoplite
 | 
Fabled Hero
 |

After a quick trip to Paris, Nakamura could only cough up a lone [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite) to fend off Yasooka's [Leonin Snarecaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Snarecaster). Yasooka declined to attack and opted to develop his position with [Borderland Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Minotaur) and Bloodrage Shaman.


Fearing a trick, he held his creatures back temporarily and Nakamura was happy to use the time to bestow [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad) upon the [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite). [Ordeal of Purphoros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Purphoros) allowed Yasooka to attack, before adding [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) and [Lagonna-Band Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lagonna-Band+Elder) to the board, resulting in yet another standstill, both players fearing a blowout.


That was until Shouta decided to go all in, an attacked back up with [Dauntless Onslaught](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Onslaught), reducing Nakamura to 10. Nakamura retaliated with [Fabled Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero) and Yasooka wasted no time pointing [Rage of Purphoros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rage+of+Purphoros) at it. Nakamura tried to save it with his own [Dauntless Onslaught](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Onslaught) but a sacrificed [Ordeal of Purphoros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Purphoros) finished him off. [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) from Yasooka granted [Borderland Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Minotaur) (7/6) protection from white, dealing the lethal blow.


### Nakamura 0 – Yasooka 1


### Game Two


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gphk13/r11_nakamura.jpg)*Shuhei Nakamura* 
It was a race between a monstrous [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and a 4/4 firebreathing [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) and Shuhei Nakamura managed to even the score, forcing a third game.



![Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fleecemane+Lion)

Nakamura kept a two-land hand but he was able apply pressure with [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and [Traveling Philosopher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveling+Philosopher).


Having no play of his own, Yasooka was forced to cycle [Dragon Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle) on his opponent's creature, prompting Nakamura to read the card momentarily. Luckily, the [Dragon Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle) netted him [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider), which he was happy to cast, leaving a white mana open.


Upon drawing his third land and forth land, Nakamura summoned [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) and [Cavalry Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalry+Pegasus) and decided against attacking into the [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) with the knowledge that [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) would result in a reversal of board advantage.


Once he hit his fifth land, [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) transformed into a 4/4 indestructible kitty and started to take violent swipes at Yasooka's life total. [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) stood in its way and picked up a +1/+1 counter from [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing), surviving the impact. On his turn, Yasooka stuck [Dragon Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle) on the [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) and started to race but to no avail.


### Nakamura 1 – Yasooka 1


### Game Three


An exciting game three saw both players cast [Dauntless Onslaught](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Onslaught) on their opponents creatures but in the end, it was Shuhei Nakamura who managed to overcome Shouta Yasooka's Elspeth Sun's Champion to win the match, advancing to a 9-2 record.


[Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) reared its ugly head once again and it would seem that Yasooka was falling behind, with only [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite) as his lone creature over 4 turns.


Yasooka declined to budge, so Nakamura was happy to add more creatures to the board, before finding a good opportunity to "monstrosify" [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and summon [Pheres-Band Centaurs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pheres-Band+Centaurs).


Despite being behind, Yasooka continued to feign weakness, until he reached six mana to recruit Elspeth, prompting Nakamura to wail "HUH?" in despair.



![Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion)

Knowing that he was out of time, Nakamura quickly used [Time to Feed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+to+Feed) to get rid of [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite), forcing Yasooka to chump block [Pheres-Band Centaurs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pheres-Band+Centaurs), [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and [Staunch-Hearted Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staunch-Hearted+Warrior) with his three Soldier tokens. Nakamura summoned the last two cards from his hand, [Cavalry Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalry+Pegasus) and [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons), hoping to finish of the powerful Planeswalker next turn.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gphk13/board.jpg)
Shouta then used [Dauntless Onslaught](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Onslaught) on the [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) and [Pheres-Band Centaurs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pheres-Band+Centaurs), before activating Elspeth's second ability. The wave of reckoning reduced Nakamura's board to just a [Cavalry Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalry+Pegasus) and the indestructible [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), versus Yasooka's [Deathbellow Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathbellow+Raider).


It would seem that the upset was happening but [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) happened to be sitting on top of Nakamura's library. That allowed him to remove [Deathbellow Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathbellow+Raider), before using the [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) to send Elspeth to the gallows.


Shouta Yasooka produced Bloodrage Shaman, and struggled to stay alive but Nakamura had yet another [Time to Feed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+to+Feed) at the ready. Shouta could only point [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) at his own creature to stay alive but Nakamura deftly denied that plan by pointing [Dauntless Onslaught](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Onslaught) at the minotaur lord, fizzling [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) and denying Shouta the 4 life he needed.


### Nakamura 2 – Yasooka 1


### Shuhei Nakamura manages to overcome Elspeth, defeating Shouta Yasooka 2-1.

Saturday, 1.15 p.m. - Reports from the Battlefield
--------------------------------------------------


*by Chapman Sim*

We are done with our first Booster Draft and proceeding on to the second! Let's take a quick look at the top four draft pods to see how the Top 8 could possibly look like.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gphk13/Tournament%20Floor.jpg)*Tournament Floor* 
### Pod 1


Martin Juza (16) is atop the standings, along with "BFF" Shuhei Nakamura (7) and "Master of Faeries" Yuuta Takahashi.


The trio will be drafting with 3 other players also at 11-1, including Ng Soon Lye of Singapore (Nationals Top 8 competitor), Christopher Tong of Hong Kong and Lu Xiaoshi of China.


Rounding out are Grand Prix Singapore 2009 Top 8 competitor, Chen Liang and Grand Prix Beijing 2013 Top 8 competitor Wong Wei Quan. This booster pod looks really stacked but only around half of these players will be able to make the Top 8.


### Pod 2


Pod two is also looking equally daunting and consists of Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* Champ, Stanislav Cifka (9), fellow Top 8 competitor Kelvin Chew from Singapore as well as Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* Semifinalist Ken Yukuhiro.


Huang Hao-Shan's three Grand Prix Top 8s indicate he is the next most experienced player in the pod. Everyone in Pod two are at a 10-2 record and would possibly need to win out to break into the Top 8.


### Pod 3


Shouta Yasooka has slipped into Pod 3 owing to his slightly worse tiebreakers and I can quite safely say he is the most experienced in his pod. Both China Nationals Top 8 competitors (Lei Yu Sheng & Lei Qiang) and former Hong Kong National Champion, Zhang Meng Qiu will not be going down without putting up a fight.


### Pod 4


It is also possible that a player from Pod 4 could break into the Top 8, provided they win all their matches in the next draft. Chua Chang (three time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor) is the most accomplished veteran from amongst them, but Grand Prix Shanghai 2012 semi-finalist Satou Rei is no slouch either.

Round 14 Feature Match - Blue White Removal Showcase Martin Juza vs. Chen Liang
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Noel Neo*

Chen Liang, a veteran of Grand Prix Singapore 2009's Top 8 and who has already picked up two losses, is playing to remain in contention for the trophy. (16) Juza is 11-1-1 and is looking to secure his top 8 berth.


Chen Liang is running with Black Green and Juza wields Blue White heroic supported with strong removal spells.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gphk13/r14_liang.jpg)*Chen Liang* 
Juza systematically dismantled Chen Liang's game one defence in three stages:

* Third, [Sea God's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+God%27s+Revenge) opened the gates for an alpha strike for the win

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gphk13/r14_juza.jpg)*Martin Juza* 
Game two featured a bit more of an early race as [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) and [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker) traded blows with [Erebos's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%27s+Emissary). The Rider took a [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock), but Juza was able to maintain his offence with [Silent Artisan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Artisan) and [Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form) on [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter). He also had [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict) to remove the last of Chen Liang's creatures.


With all the scry occurring on Juza's side of the table, it wasn't long before Chen Liang was simply overwhelmed by superior card quality.


### (16) Martin Juza wins 2-0 and is nearly a lock for top 8.

Sunday, 3:00pm - Drafting with Martin Juza
------------------------------------------


*by Noel Neo*

Earlier today, we sat down with Juza to glean insight into his *Theros* Limited thought process. He expressed a distinct preference for a single card – [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr).


"It is unique in being the cheapest mana ramp in the format and the tempo advantage is hugely important. When you're the first to summon your large beaters and to go monstrous, it is much easier to push damage through."


Now at 11-1 and first seed, Juza is very favourably placed for a run at the Top 8. Let's see how he puts a deck together from the ground up.


### Booster One


Juza started the draft by picking up [Horizon Scholar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Scholar), the most efficient threat in the pack. True to form he followed that with [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr) over Minotaur Battlemaster and [Baleful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Eidolon), but subsequently switched to White with [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid) over [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons). The choice rewarded him as Blue and Green dried up, indicating that the players to his right were in those colours.


Below lists the key cards Juza considered in each pack, with his picks depicted as the leftmost card.


1 [Horizon Scholar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Scholar), [Ordeal of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Nylea), [Pharika's Cure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure), [Rage of Purphoros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rage+of+Purphoros), [Deathbellow Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathbellow+Raider)

14 [Demolish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demolish)


### Booster Two


Despite a number of Green cards appearing, Juza stuck to his Blue White guns. He would later explain this is because Green would be cut again in booster three.


1 [Sea God's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+God%27s+Revenge), [Triton Tactics](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Tactics), [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid)

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gphk13/juzadraft2.jpg)*Juza is not a fan of [Anvilwrought Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anvilwrought+Raptor)*
### Booster Three


During the booster two review, Juza realised while he has some very strong spells, he lacks in actual ways to close out the game. Hence, his focus for booster three was to shore up his offensive capabilities. He managed to pick up a second pick [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) and would come to rue his fourth pick of Anvilwrought Rapter over [Cavalry Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalry+Pegasus) as he would come to have quite a number of human creatures.


1 [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary), [Sea God's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+God%27s+Revenge), [Lash of the Whip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+of+the+Whip), [Tymaret, the Murder King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tymaret%2C+the+Murder+King)  

2 [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider), [Triton Tactics](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Tactics)  

3 [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing), [Lash of the Whip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+of+the+Whip)  

4 [Anvilwrought Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anvilwrought+Raptor), [Cavalry Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalry+Pegasus), [Setessan Battle Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Battle+Priest) (Pegasus would have been better)  

5 [Daxos of Meletis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daxos+of+Meletis)  

6 [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary), [Evangel of Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evangel+of+Heliod)  

7 [Traveling Philosopher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveling+Philosopher), [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing)  

8 [Chosen by Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chosen+by+Heliod), [Mnemonic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mnemonic+Wall)  

9 [Read the Bones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones), [Thassa's Bounty](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Bounty)  

10 [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker)  

11 [Prowler's Helm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prowler%27s+Helm)  

12 [Setessan Battle Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Battle+Priest)  

13 [Defend the Hearth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defend+the+Hearth)  

14 [Felhide Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felhide+Minotaur)


### Deckbuilding


Overall, Juza thought his draft was okay (not fantastic) with good cards and a fine curve. His game plan is to play a two or three drop and suit it up, all the while disrupting his opponent's offence through removal and bounce. A weakness is a relative dearth of high power and evasion creatures, so his games are likely to be somewhat draw dependent. Juza also noted the removal he had seen, which meant opponents might be able to disrupt his plan as well.


Despite some late game spells, Juza is running 17 lands because he has sufficient scry to find them. He pondered long and hard about the relative merits of a second [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict) (reactive) relative to [Anvilwrought Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anvilwrought+Raptor) (cost inefficient) and [Ray of Dissolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Dissolution) (narrow scope), and eventually decided to stick with the verdict.

Round 15 Feature Match - Lei Qiang VS Lei Yu Sheng
--------------------------------------------------


*by Chapman Sim*

The pair of Chinese players found themselves in the unfortunate position of being unable to draw and were forced to battle it out in the final Swiss round of the day. Both players are former China Nationals Top 8 competitors, and also happen to be cousins, which is a great explanation for their identical family name.


While they were not pleased to be in this precadiment, they proceeded on with the match knowing that at least one of them would make it, putting a second Chinese player into the Top 8 this weekend. When the dust settled, it was Lei Yu Sheng who emerged victorious.


### Game One

![Bident of Thassa++Warriors' Lesson](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Warriors'%20Lesson&options=)

*That's a lot of cards!*
The first game was all about card advantage. [Bident of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa) and [Warriors' Lesson](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warriors%27+Lesson) allowed Lei Yu Sheng to defeat Lei Qiang by simply burying him an endless steam of threats and tricks.


Lei Yu Sheng had a fast start, powering out [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker), [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) and [Bident of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa). Lei Qiang had no board presence and sought to find some with [Read the Bones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones).

Using this opportunity, Lei Yu Sheng cast Warriors' Lesson on both of his creatures, netting himself a total of four cards. This allowed him to steamroll over Lei Qiang effortlessly with the grip of cards which he gained, including [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) and [Nimbus Naiad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad), which eventually drew him more cards than his cousin could handle.


Lei Qiang 0 – Lei Yu Sheng 1


### Game Two


  

Lei Yu Sheng led with a pair of [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin)s that promised to end the game quickly if left untouched. Without any quick solutions like [Pharika's Cure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure), Lei Qiang sought to race with a pair of [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons).

![Vaporkin++Vaporkin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vaporkin&options=)

*A pair of [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin)s send Lei Yu Sheng into the Top 8!* 
When [Breaching Hippocamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breaching+Hippocamp) jumped out for the first time, Lei Qiang used [Boon of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+of+Erebos) to keep one of his agents alive. If you haven't been following the math, the lone [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) came in for 2 damage, and then both swooped in for 4 the next turn. And then 4 more. [Boon of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+of+Erebos) reduced Lei Qiang to just 8 life, which meant that he was facing a pressurizing two-turn clock.


Lei Yu Sheng didn't even need the [Vulpine Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulpine+Goliath) to seal the deal. Now that his cousin was down to just 8 life, all he had to do was to swing twice for the win.


Lei Qiang 0 – Lei Yu Sheng 2

Lei Yu Sheng defeats his cousin Lei Qiang to advance to the Top 8!
