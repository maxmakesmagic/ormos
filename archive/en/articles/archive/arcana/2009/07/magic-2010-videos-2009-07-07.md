Before we continue with the other ten (!) clips, it's time for Core Set Survivor.

  
  
  
**Core Set Survivor!**There are exactly sixteen cards that have been in every core set from *Alpha* to *Tenth Edition*. When ***Magic** 2010* comes out, only *eight* cards will have been in every core set. Over the weeks before the ***Magic** 2010* prerelease, we'll be counting them down in this special Arcana sub-feature, giving you an "IN" or "OUT" on one card a day. Step forward, [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider).
