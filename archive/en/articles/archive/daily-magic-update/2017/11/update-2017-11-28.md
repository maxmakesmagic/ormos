The November 28, 2017 Update

 Katie is a copy editor and occasional writer for DailyMTG, as well as a longtime Magic player with a fondness for giant green creatures. She especially loves Commander, despite having the patience of a fruit fly, and might glare at you if your turn takes too long. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 28, 2017. And one big thing you should know is that this will be **the last Daily *Magic* Update ever**! Don't worry, it doesn't mean you'll find any less *Magic* content here—[like Blake said](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/new-dailymtg-2017-11-09), it's just going to look a little different. After today you'll be able to see the same great articles right on the DailyMTG homepage, saving you the extravagant trouble of clicking on the Update *then* clicking another link. What you do with all the time this frees up is entirely up to you. The sky's your oyster! Or something!


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> We're saddened by what happened in the Magic community this weekend. Cyber bullying and harassment are unacceptable, and we support those who come forward with their experiences. No one should be made to feel unsafe or unwelcome. We're working to be a part of the solution.

Over the weekend, discussion about some incredibly toxic behavior toward members of the *Magic* community came to a head. We will be taking action to address it, and should have more information later today on the specific steps we'll be taking. In the meantime, we are encouraging anyone who has experienced harassment or bullying within the *Magic* community to reach out to us with your stories. *Magic* should be about getting together and having fun with friends, and we will be working harder to keep it that way.


1. An Open Letter to the *Magic* Community | Various pros

In an article posted on [several](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=14312&writer=Various+Pros&articledate=11-28-2017) [*Magic*](https://www.channelfireball.com/home/an-open-letter-to-the-magic-community/) [content](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36242_An-Open-Letter-From-Members-Of-The-Professional-Magic-Scene-To-The-Magic-Community-At-Large.html) sites this morning, pro players from around the world stood up in support of an open and inclusive community. As they say, "It's not about the *Magic*, it's about the gathering."


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Deck Evolutions: Modern Humans](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/deck-evolutions-modern-humans?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

"Modern Humans," the next entry in my famous guessing game of "*Magic* deck archetype or hipster indie rock band?" Ahem. So Humans, as one of the biggest and longest-running tribes in all of *Magic*, have shown up in Modern since it started. Every set has Humans in it, so the "best" Humans deck has never been a static concept. (Remember when [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) didn't even exist?) SaffronOlive walks us through the evolution of his current favorite build, which has changed almost completely since 2016's Naya Aggro Humans.


1. [Revere the Hammer](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36227_Revere-The-Hammer.html) | StarCityGames.com | Bennie Smith

Breaking news: Equipment is good in Commander! Okay, I admit that's not really news. At all. But if you're like me—an obsessive Commander player who stubbornly loves trying to win with good old-fashioned creature attacks—you'll probably want to check out Bennie's [Nazahn, Revered Bladesmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nazahn%2C+Revered+Bladesmith) build. It combines the best of the *Commander (2017 Edition)* "Feline Ferocity" deck with a lot of the best Equipment and Equipment enablers from throughout history to make a deck that looks basically *purrfect*. (I'm not sorry about that one, actually.)


1. [Vintage BUG Survival](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/11/vintage-bug-suvival/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Aaron Gazzaniga

I have a strange fascination with Vintage. I have never even attempted to play it, it scares the socks right off my feet, and I'm pretty convinced there's actual lowercase magic involved. So when I see a Vintage deck that actually makes some sense to me (aka please don't make me keep track of storm count), I get excited! This list is extra-interesting because it runs [Survival of the Fittest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest) over the widely favored [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) for a green creature engine. There's also a pair of [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla)s, which my childhood self would be excited to see. This deck looks great.


1. [*Unstable Magic* Math: White, Blue, and Black](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/magic-math-unstable-white-blue-and-black/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Yes, of all the things in *Unstable*, it really is about the math. Frank ranks *Magic* sets for Summon the Pack by creature stats and frequency. He explains a probability model called a "Markov chain" for Inhumaniac (sadly unrelated to our friendly Innistrad Vampire clan). He discusses the rules and implications of recursive chess based on the *flavor text* of Sacrifice Play. Basically what I'm saying is that this is the nerdiest article I've read all week, and I love it.


1. [MTG Pro Tutor – 256: Analyzing Strategy and Knowing Your Role for the Win with Torsten Anders](http://mtgcast.com/mtgcast-podcast-shows/active-podcast-shows/mtg-pro-tutor/mtg-pro-tutor-256-analyzing-strategy-and-knowing-your-role-for-the-win-with-torsten-anders) | MTGCast | Shaun Penrod

Shaun interviews pro player Torsten Anders (most recently known for making Top 8 at [Grand Prix Liverpool](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpliv17) in October) about everything from his very first *Magic* experiences to his tips for competing at the highest level. Even if you just want to get more confident entering tournaments at Friday Night *Magic*, some of Torsten's advice will probably be relevant to you!


Top 25
======


1. No changes!

This week, there were no changes to the Top 25. But with the World *Magic* Cup coming up this weekend, that's not so likely to be true next week, so stay tuned.

Deck of the Day
===============


1. Darthjacen's Esper Approach

[Approach of the Second Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun) combo decks definitely aren't new in Standard, but the vast majority of them (at least up till now) have been white-blue. *Magic Online* user Darthjacen's version adds black for [Fatal Push](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Push), [Vraska's Contempt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska%27s+Contempt), and a couple of sideboard-lurking [The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God)s. It's got a brutal removal package to back up the standard suite of countermagic. I can only imagine the frustration of trying to keep a creature on the board against this deck!
