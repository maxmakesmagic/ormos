![Feature Match: Gabriel Nassif vs. Pierre Malherbaud](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/976.jpg)This match saw two of France's top Pro Tour players face off in a Charbelcher mirror match. Their decks aren't quite the same, as Malherbaud is splashing black for the consistency of [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor), while Nassif is mono-blue. 

### Game 1

Malherbaud mulliganed his opening hand, joking, "That was only a turn five kill, not a chance." Nassif started with [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) and [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), but Malherbaud's first turn was better- [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), [Goblin Charbelcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher), "Go." Things seemed bad for Nassif, but he matched Malherbaud, [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ing for [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) and playing his own turn two Charbelcher. [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) drew Malherbaud into [Rushing River](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rushing+River), which bounced back Nassif's [Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus) and Charbelcher. This seemed to put Nassif far behind but he bounced right back, playing [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) and the Charbelcher. On his next turn he [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) into [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) and cast [Mana Severance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance) with enough mana to activate the Charbelcher, and Malherbaud conceded.

Malherbaud 0 - Nassif 1

### Game 2

![Pierre Malherbaud gets ready to belch](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/978.jpg)This time, Nassif mulliganed his opening hand. Malherbaud started with [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) and [Talisman of Dominance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Dominance), and cast [Mana Severance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance) to rid his deck of lands on the first turn. [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) led to [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) and the Charbelcher, and a third turn kill.

Malherbaud 1 - Nassif 1

### Game 3

Nassif had [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) and [Talisman of Progress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Progress), and Malherbaud made the same play but his Talisman was countered with [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul). Nassif played a second Talisman and [Mana Severance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance), and had [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) on the following turn for the Charbelcher and the win.

Malherbaud 1 - Nassif 2
