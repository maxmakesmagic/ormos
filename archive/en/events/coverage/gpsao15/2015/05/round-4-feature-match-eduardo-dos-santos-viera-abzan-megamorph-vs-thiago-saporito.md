 This match featured two heavyweights of Brazilian *Magic*, both of whom had chosen to sleeve up [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) for this event.



The Players
===========



 Thiago Saporito has had a great year. He finished third at Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, followed by a Top 8 appearance at the World *Magic* Cup and decent finishes at other events as well. As a result, he is the first Brazilian player to lock Gold in the Pro Players club besides Willy Edel and Paulo Vitor Damo Da Rosa. At 39 points this season, he's only a few points away from Platinum.



Eduardo dos Santos Viera, on the other side of the table, has already locked Silver level in the Pro Player club on the back of good performances at Latin American Grand Prix tournaments this season: He has two Grand Prix Top 8s, with a win in Santiago, to his name. He is qualified for Pro Tour Vancouver and sits at 26 points so far, so he's fighting for more points to clinch Gold.

The Decks
=========


Both players were running the [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) / [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) engine that has been growing in popularity as of late, but they had different ideas on what color combination is the best home for it. Saporito chose to go with Bant, favoring a splash of blue for [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) and countermagic from the sideboard. Dos Santos Viera went with Abzan, opting for a black splash for [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm).


The players agreed that the black version has a small edge in the matchup because it has access to [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) to stop [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) recursion.


Game 1
======


Early on, dos Santos Viera was able to set up the most favorable exchanges, as he played [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) to kill both [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and cast [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) to exile [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor). However, dos Santos Viera had no way to stop Saporito's [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) from going monstrous, and the indestructible 4/4 whittled down dos Santos Viera's life total before he found [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) as a suitable blocker.

A while later, both players had gone through several [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) recursion cycles, and both of them got [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) in play. However, Saporito had the mana advantage and was able to activate the enchantment twice a turn. Soon enough, he hit another [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor), unmorphed it to return another one from his graveyard, and used them to overwhelmed dos Santos Viera.

Sideboarding
============


Saporito added [Encase in Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Encase+in+Ice) and [Stratus Dancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Dancer), cutting inefficient removal spells like [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance).


Dos Santos Viera brought in [Glare of Heresy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Heresy) and [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), removing a combination of [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) from this deck.


Game 2
======


The early game was all about answers to [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion). After a few turns, dos Santos Viera had 2 [Glare of Heresy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Heresy) in his graveyard and a [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) enchanted with [Encase in Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Encase+in+Ice) in play, while Saporito had 2 [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) in his graveyard.

Then, it was time for the big hitters and value trades. Saporito started by putting down [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) and passed the turn with a morph in play and two mana up. Dos Santos Viera, who must have been aware of the presence of [Stratus Dancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Dancer), led with [Glare of Heresy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Heresy). Saporito took the bait. He unmorphed [Stratus Dancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Dancer), but that was exactly what dos Santos Viera was hoping for. [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) resolved successfully, and Saporito looked helpless as both his [Stratus Dancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Dancer) and the [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) were sent to the graveyard.


But he wasn't outdone yet and summoned [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai). It attacked…and connected! Without an answer to the Dragonlord, dos Santos Viera could not keep up with the card advantage that Saporito was generating, and several turns later he had to extend his hand in defeat.
