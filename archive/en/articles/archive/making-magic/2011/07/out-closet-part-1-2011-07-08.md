Hello, faithful readers. Today is a very personal column. I'm almost at the ten-year mark (and very close to the five-hundred-week mark), yet there are things I haven't yet shared with you. In fact, I'm about to reveal something that might seem inconsistent for a married man with three children, but I've hidden the truth for far too long. This is kind of hard to put into words, so I'll do it with a picture. Brace yourself.

My hidden secret is that I'm...

Yes, I have so many T-shirts that if all of them were clean at one time, there would not be enough room in my closet to fit them all. Luckily, I have a family of five, so that never happens.

Of my voluminous T-shirt collection, a large number of the shirts are associated with **Magic: The Gathering**. This is due to three major factors: 1) I'm a big fan of **Magic**. 2) I believe T-shirts are an extension of the person who wears them and I like to express what I do for a living. Plus, a great way to find other **Magic** players is to wear a **Magic** T-shirt. 3) The vast majority of my **Magic** T-shirts were free.

In today's column (and part 2 in two weeks), I am going to countdown my top twenty **Magic** T-shirts of all time. With each I'll explain where I got the shirt, what significance it has to me, and what makes it one of my favorites. Be aware that at present I have well over fifty **Magic** T-shirts and I've given away to charity many others that haven't managed to make the cut.

Before I continue, let me answer a few questions I'm sure were raised by the above photo. Yes, my shirts are color-coded. It makes it much easier to find the shirt I need. Yes, the entire upper right half of my shirt collection is flannels. I currently have around eighty.

With that out of the way, let's get onto the shirts.

20) Grand Prix Rio (1998)
Grand Prix Rio was the very first South American Grand Prix. It had an exciting final match between two South American icons: Jon Finkel and Steven O-Mahoney-Schwartz. (Finkel won.) But that's not the reason the shirt's an emotional favorite.
