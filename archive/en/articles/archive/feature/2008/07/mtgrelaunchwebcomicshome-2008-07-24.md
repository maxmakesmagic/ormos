Mages and planeswalkers of the Multiverse can cast a vast array of spells—they can drain the life of a foe, supplement their allies with arcane strength, even summon a dragon. But all magic requires mana. Mana is the magical energy that powers spells. Where do you get it? Mana comes from the land. Mages must know a place to gather mana from it. Mana is scarce, so mages don't have infinite energy to cast spells. They must make bonds with lands to gain new sources of mana.


There are five colors of mana, and each comes from a different type of land:





* White — Plains
* Blue — Islands
* Black — Swamps
* Red — Mountains
* Green — Forests

Each color is driven by different values: 




|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WHITE | BLUE | BLACK | RED | GREEN |
| Order | Knowledge | Darkness | Freedom | Growth |
| Protection | Manipulation | Ambition | Emotion | Instinct |
| Light | Illusion | Death | Impulse | Nature |
