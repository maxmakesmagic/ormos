**The Year of Modern Flashbacks Continues**


It's 2016: The Year of Modern Flashbacks! If you want to build up a collection for Modern, these Flashback Drafts add everything you draft to you collection once the event is over. Even if Modern isn't your thing, you can enjoy a leisurely draft through the planes of the past with rotating formats each week!


Triple *Ravnica: City of Guilds* Flashback Drafts begin on Wednesday, March 16th at 10:00 a.m. PT (UTC-7) and run until Wednesday, March 23 at 12:00 a.m. PT (UTC-7), midnight, and are followed up by *Ravnica: City of Guilds*-*Ravnica: City of Guilds*-*Guildpact*. Get the full schedule [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/year-of-modern-flashbacks-2015-12-14) and mark your calendar for the formats you're most excited about!


**Note:** Due to bugs impacting *Ravnica: City of Guilds* cards [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon) and [Leashling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leashling), *Ravnica: City of Guilds* boosters opened between March 16th at 8:00 a.m. and the March 23rd downtime will not contain these cards, whether in the events or through the Collection. [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon) will be fixed starting with the March 23rd downtime and will be added back to *Ravnica: City of Guilds* boosters at that time. [Leashling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leashling) will be available in boosters again on April 6th after Ravnica Block Flashback Drafts come to an end.

**Upcoming Modern MOCS Monthly Event on March 19**


A *Magic Online* Championship Series (MOCS) Modern Monthly Event is coming up on March 19! Players who have at least 35 Qualifier Points (QPs) in their account are eligible to participate. The series will contain twelve Monthly Events, each of which qualify top players for one of the four Playoff Events. These Playoff Events qualify top players for the *Magic Online* Championship, a Pro Tour, and the Pro Tour Challenge event at that Pro Tour.


Monthly and Playoff Events also award top players MOCS Leaderboard Points for the current quarter and for the year as a whole. Players of sufficient standing on the MOCS Leaderboard(s) will also qualify for Playoff Events later in the 2016 *Magic Online* Championship Series as well as the *Magic Online* Championship.

**Upcoming *Oath of the Gatewatch*-*Battle for Zendikar* Sealed PTQ on Sunday, March 20**


Attention all Pro Tour hopefuls, a Pro Tour Qualifier (PTQ) is approaching! The *Oath of the Gatewatch*-*Battle for Zendikar* Sealed Pro Tour Qualifier Preliminaries begin Thursday, March 17, and run through Sunday, March 20. We hope to see you in the PTQ Finals on Sunday, March 20!


Remember, you are no longer required to enter into the PTQ Finals immediately following the Preliminary that you qualified through thanks to the redesigned PTQ system that Lee Sharpe announced [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-qualifier-changes-2015-11-16).


**Please note, if you still have red Pro Tour Qualifier finals tokens in your account, you have until the end of the Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* qualifier season to use them.**

**Upcoming Extended Downtime on Wednesday, March 23**


There will be an extended downtime on Wednesday, March 23, for *Magic Online*. Events close at 12:00 a.m. PT (UTC-7), midnight, and store activity and trades end at 2:45 a.m., leading up to the system coming down at 3:00 a.m. The system is estimated to return from downtime at 12:00 p.m.

**Reminder: No Downtime on March 16**


In an effort to make sure *Magic Online* is available when you want to play *Magic*, we’re working on ways to reduce the number of times we have to bring the system offline for maintenance. As a first step, we’re simply going to eliminate at least one downtime each month.


Here are the dates of the exact downtimes we'll be skipping in the first half of 2016:


* **March 16**
* April 6
* April 20
* May 11
* June 8
* June 22

During these weeks without a downtime, *Magic Online* will NOT be processing set redemptions. **This means that if your order wasn't made prior to the March 9 downtime, it won't be processed until March 23.**
