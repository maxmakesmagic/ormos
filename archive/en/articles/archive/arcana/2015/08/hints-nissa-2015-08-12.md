 Yichao is a writer of words for plays, television, theme parks, and—most recently—Magic: The Gathering. He loves Cube Draft and corgis. 






We first met Nissa back in the original *Zendikar* block. Most recently, we got to know her quite well in *Magic Origins*. In between, though, Nissa was rather shy, only showing up on a handful of cards. However, Nissa's presence was seen through flavor text and in other, subtler ways. Let's take a look at some cards that felt Nissa's touch!

Nissa's words appear on [Boundless Realms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boundless+Realms), a fitting card that searches up lands (very appropriate to our Worldwaker Animist) and also hints at the vastness of the Multiverse.

[The first iteration of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa+Revane) summoned [Nissa's Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Chosen) from a player's library. Little did we know, someone had a vendetta against [Nissa's Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Chosen).

Nissa seems to have a long-running animosity towards the vampires of Zendikar. From the original *Zendikar* block all the way to *Magic Origins*, Nissa has been defeating vampires for a while now.


Check out all of Nissa's story, [past](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/nissas-origin-home-2015-07-08) and [present](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/nissa-worldwaker-2014-06-25). Then give [*Magic Duels*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-duels) a go and play through her story yourself!
