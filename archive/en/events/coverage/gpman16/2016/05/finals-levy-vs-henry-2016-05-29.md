In this all-French finals, we had a battle between two of the best decks in Standard and two of the best players in the event.


On one side of the table, we had Raphaël Lévy, a 34-year old veteran from Toulouse. He is a member of the Magic Pro Tour Hall of Fame and had won five Grand Prix tournaments before in his career. In this event, he entered with his take on Green-White Tokens. It included two copies of [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) that he could only cast via [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa).


On the other side of the table, we had Julien Henry, a 23-year old student from Reims. He had recently competed in Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*, and the Top 8 at this Grand Prix meant a qualification for Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* and silver level in the pro player club for him. So we'll see him again in Sydney and Honolulu. His deck choice at this Grand Prix was Bant Company because he felt it had a very high power level and game against everything.


After exchanging a mutual "bonne chance," which is French for good luck, the match got underway.


**Game 1**


In the early turns of the game, both players developed their board position, with Levy seemingly coming out ahead.

*Raphaël Lévy and Julien Henry*


On Levy's sixth turn, after his attack, the board state was as follows:


Levy (20 life) – 4/5 [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate), 3/3 [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker), Knight Ally token, [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) with 4 loyalty.


Hendry (14 life) – 2 [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate), [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner), [Duskwatch Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskwatch+Recruiter).


It seemed like Levy held the advantage, as he was ticking up his planeswalker and had plenty of blockers to properly defend it. But Henry navigated that situation well: He cast not just one, but two [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) on the subsequent turn, bouncing both [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) and [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate). He then pointed an attack at Gideon. Afterwards, Levy's lead had turned into a massive advantage for Henry, as the game state turned into six non-land permanents for Henry and only one for Levy.


Could Levy battle back? His deck had two main ways to sweep the opposing board: he could either use [Evolutionary Leap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolutionary+Leap) to set up an [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) transformation, or he could cast [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller). However, when Henry added two additional [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) to the battlefield, that sweeper plan wouldn’t work anymore as those 4/5s had too much toughness.


So Levy played a bunch of blockers instead, but that was not enough. A third [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) from Henry easily allowed him to set up a lethal attack.

**Game 2**


As the game got underway, both players filled up the battlefield with powerful permanents and card advantage engines.

*Raphaël Lévy*


On Lévy's sixth turn, both players still had high life totals, and after a mid-combat [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), the board looked as follows:


Lévy – [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) with three loyalty counters, two Knight Ally tokens, [Evolutionary Leap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolutionary+Leap), [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate), and [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn)


Henry – 3/2 [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker), [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage), two 2/3 [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate), [Nissa, Vastwood Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Vastwood+Seer), and three clues tokens (thanks to [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds))


That's quite a complicated board state, but Lévy was about to make it much simpler. He sacrificed a token to [Evolutionary Leap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolutionary+Leap) to transform his Avacyn and passed the turn. On his upkeep, in response to Avacyn's trigger, Henry sacrificed two clue tokens in the hope that his [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker) would survive. It was to no avail, as Lévy finished off the Tracker with [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) while putting a counter on his [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) to make it survive.


After the dust settled, Lévy had four relevant non-land permanents and Henry had none. Henry surveyed the board, but given that he was tapped out, he saw no way out and conceded the game.

**Game 3**


Henry got to be on the play this time. He started with [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) on turn two, [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) for Lévy's [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar) on turn three, and [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner) on turn three.

*Julien Henry*


When Lévy cast [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar), Henry had [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) to bounce the Knight Ally token, and attacked Gideon with all of his creatures. But three damage was not enough to reduce the planeswalker's loyalty to zero, and that turned out to make a big difference over the course of the next few turns.


Lévy started by using [Planar Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Outburst) to sweep the board. Well, except for Gideon, which then started attacking. The planeswalker-turned-creature first took down [Jace, Telepath Unbound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Telepath+Unbound), then went after Henry's life total.


Now on the back foot, Henry had to find an answer for Gideon, and he had to be quick about it. But the next couple of turns all turned out in Lévy favor. First there was [Hallowed Moonlight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Moonlight) to counter [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company). Then [Lambholt Pacifist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lambholt+Pacifist) and [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) were added to the board.


And all the while, that Gideon kept on attacking relentlessly. Lévy had brought a wide assortment of self-crafted tokens with him, but in the final game of the tournament, he didn't need them—the plus ability from Gideon was the only one he really needed, and several attacks later, he had reduced Henry's life total to zero.


Raphaël Lévy 2 – Julien Henry 1


Congratulations to Raphaël Lévy, winner of Grand Prix Manchester! That's his sixth!
