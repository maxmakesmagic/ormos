### Farand Lee


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gphk17/T8_1FarandLee.jpg)


**City, Country:** Vancouver, Canada


**Age:** 32


**Occupation:** Gate Gourmet Dispatcher


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 2014 MOCS Championship competitor


**Day 1 Summary:** 7 - 2 (No byes). I played a White-Black deck with a total of twelve one-drops and two-drops.


**Day 2 Summary:** 6 - 0. I drafted Black-Red with three [Bonded Horncrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Horncrest). In the second draft, I had a White-Black deck and the best card was [Ruin Raider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+Raider).


**Since *Ixalan*'s release till today, which card was better than you thought? Also, which card was worse than you thought?**


[Rigging Runner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rigging+Runner) was better than I thought, because first strike is good in a format of weenie creatures. On the other hand, [Ixalan's Binding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ixalan%27s+Binding) was not as good because everyone seems to have a way to remove it.


**What is your favorite memory of the weekend?**


Accomplishing my goal of making Day 2 for this week.

### Jacob Hart


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gphk17/T8_2JacobHart.jpg)


**City, Country:** Albury, Australia


**Age:** 37


**Occupation:** Sports Analyst


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Three Grand Prix Top 8s and three Nationals Top 8s


**Day 1 Summary:** I went 9 - 0 with 2 byes. My Red-Green deck had [Waker of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waker+of+the+Wilds) and two [River Heralds' Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Heralds%27+Boon).


**Day 2 Summary:** I went 3 - 0 in the first draft with Blue-Green Merfolk and I won many games with [Shaper Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Apprentice), [Jade Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jade+Guardian), and [Emergent Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emergent+Growth)! At that point, I was 12 - 0 and locked for the Top 8!


**Since *Ixalan*'s release till today, which card was better than you thought? Also, which card was worse than you thought?**


[Emergent Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emergent+Growth) was amazing in Merfolk because it wins games out of nowhere. On the other hand, [Contract Killing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contract+Killing) has been really bad for me in Booster Draft because you don't want to play a five-mana card and get blown out by [Dive Down](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Down).


**What is your favorite memory of the weekend?**


Nobody played [Charging Monstrosaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charging+Monstrosaur) against me.

### Vinod Prabhu


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gphk17/T8_3VinodPrabhu.jpg)


**City, Country:** Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam


**Age:** 35


**Occupation:** Teacher


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Top 16 at Grand Prix Nashville 2009


**Day 1 Summary:** 8 - 1 with zero byes. I played Black-Green because I had [Vraska, Relic Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska%2C+Relic+Seeker). Why else play Black-Green?


**Day 2 Summary:** I drafted Blue-Black and Black-Green in Day 2 and went 4 - 0 - 2. My Blue-Black deck was great and had two [Wanted Scoundrels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wanted+Scoundrels) and two [Walk the Plank](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walk+the+Plank)s!


**Since *Ixalan*'s release till today, which card was better than you thought? Also, which card was worse than you thought?**


[Pirate's Cutlass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pirate%27s+Cutlass). Equipment is usually bad but it might be the best uncommon. As for the cards which were worse than I thought, it would have to be most of the expensive bomb rares.


**What is your favorite memory of the weekend?**


Getting the opportunity to represent Vietnam in the Top 8 of a Grand Prix!

### Lee Shi Tian

**City, Country:** Hong Kong


**Age:** 30


**Occupation:** Accountant


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 5 Pro Tour Top 8s, 9 Grand Prix Top 8s with 1 win


**Day 1 Summary:** 9 - 0 with 3 byes. I had a Red-Green deck and [Vance's Blasting Cannons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vance%27s+Blasting+Cannons) was amazing.


**Day 2 Summary:** In Day 2, I went 2 - 1 with White-Green Dinosaurs (double [Imperial Aerosaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperial+Aerosaur)!) and 1 - 1 - 1 with White-Red (double [Imperial Aerosaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperial+Aerosaur) again!).


**Since *Ixalan*'s release till today, which card was better than you thought? Also, which card was worse than you thought?**


[Dive Down](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Down). I got blown out multiple times this weekend. On the other hand, [Elaborate Firecannon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elaborate+Firecannon) was horrible. The best use of it is to hide it inside my deck box and point it at my opponents direction.


**What is your favorite memory of the weekend?**


I was a victim of Settle the Wreck two rounds in a row during Day 1.

### Tay Jun Hao

**City, Country:** Singapore


**Age:** 29


**Occupation:** Store Owner of Grey Ogre Games


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Top 8 at Grand Prix Singapore 2015


**Day 1 Summary:** 9 - 0 with 2 byes. I had a great Blue-Red deck in Day 1.


**Day 2 Summary:** 3 - 2 - 1 with White-Black Vampires featuring two [Adanto Vanguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adanto+Vanguard) and Red-Green Dinosaurs with [Regisaur Alpha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regisaur+Alpha) *and* [Charging Monstrosaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charging+Monstrosaur)!


**Since *Ixalan*'s release till today, which card was better than you thought? Also, which card was worse than you thought?**


[Pirate's Cutlass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pirate%27s+Cutlass) was better than I thought. It makes your bad creatures "less bad". [Contract Killing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contract+Killing) is too slow and it is a sorcery.


**What is your favorite memory of the weekend?**


Going 9 - 0 in Day 1 for the very first time!

### Hoi Chick


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gphk17/T8_6HoiChick.jpg)


**City, Country:** Hong Kong


**Age:** 42


**Occupation:** Merchandiser


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** I made the Hong Kong National team a few times (and have over 50 Friday Night *Magic* Top 8s).


**Day 1 Summary:** 8 - 1 with 1 bye. [Savage Stomp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Stomp) was great in my Red-Green deck.


**Day 2 Summary:** 4 - 1 - 1 on Day 2. My first draft deck was Red-Green Dinosaur and I had three [Raging Swordtooth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Swordtooth). In the second draft, I drafted a White-Black deck with no good cards in it.


**Since *Ixalan*'s release till today, which card was better than you thought? Also, which card was worse than you thought?**


[Pirate's Cutlass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pirate%27s+Cutlass). It's just good in almost every deck. As for the second question, I'm not sure!


**What is your favorite memory of the weekend?**


I'm really happy to make Top 8 and I want to say thank you to my teammates from "Topdecks" and "Battleground" for all the support.

### Kazuyuki Takimura


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gphk17/T8_7KazuyukiTakimura.jpg)


**City, Country:** Tokyo, Japan


**Age:** 33


**Occupation:** Game Planner


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar* Champion


**Day 1 Summary:** 8 - 1 with 1 bye. My deck was Blue-Green splash Red and [New Horizons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=New+Horizons) did a great job.


**Day 2 Summary:** 4 - 1 - 1. I drafted White-Red and Red-Green and [Tilonalli's Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tilonalli%27s+Knight) was amazing in both decks.


**Since *Ixalan*'s release till today, which card was better than you thought? Also, which card was worse than you thought?**


[Rummaging Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rummaging+Goblin), because it prevents mana flood. Commune the Dinosaurs looks good but it can only take Dinosaurs (taking a land is not a big deal) and it sets you back one turn.


**What is your favorite memory of the weekend?**


I discussed how to draft this format with my roommate, Sato Rei (and made Top 8 together).

### Sato Rei


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gphk17/T8_8SatoRei.jpg)


**City, Country:** Kanagawa, Japan


**Age:** 29


**Occupation:** Gamer


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Top 8 at Grand Prix Shanghai 2012


**Day 1 Summary:** 7 - 1 - 1 with 2 byes. I had a White-Black deck with "[Hellrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellrider)" ([Sanctum Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+Seeker)).


**Day 2 Summary:** I went 5 - 1 drafting White-Red both times. I won many games with [Repeating Barrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeating+Barrage) in Draft 1, and [Brazen Buccaneers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brazen+Buccaneers) was my MVP in Draft 2.


**Since *Ixalan*'s release till today, which card was better than you thought? Also, which card was worse than you thought?**


[Brazen Buccaneers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brazen+Buccaneers). It looks average but it is actually great because it has haste. The card pairs well with [Territorial Hammerskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Territorial+Hammerskull) and [Headstrong Brute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Headstrong+Brute). [Vanquisher's Banner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vanquisher%27s+Banner) looks good but it is very difficult to gather a lot of creatures with the same type.
