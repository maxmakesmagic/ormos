![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpnj04/day1.jpg)Things are underway again here in New Jersey. 128 players will play through six rounds of swiss today in order to determine which eight will make it to the elimination rounds. Eugene Harvey, John Pelcak, Paul Russell, and Josh Rider were the four undefeated players going into the day, but Pelcak and Russell quickly fell, and when Harvey defeated Rider in round 11, Eugenius stood alone at the top of the standings. 


Looking at the Day 2 decklists, the field remains relatively diverse, with Affinity and Big Red yielding the greatest numbers of Sunday players. While R/G was played by fewer players overall, those players seemed to have a great deal of success on Day 1. 


There are plenty of big names still in the hunt for the final spots, with Kai Budde, Gabriel Nassif, and Jeroen Remie still in contention to make the final eight and boost their position in the Player of the Year race. Join us throughout the day and into the night as we bring you all the stories from the biggest North American Grand Prix ever.
