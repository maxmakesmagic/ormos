The Level 1 Practice exam was created in April 2009 and since then, nearly 2,000 such exams have been created by users. As a result, there have been questions from individuals who've taken the exam, or who are interested in taking the exam. This article should address the most common questions that have been asked and help explain a few elements of the exam itself.


The Level 1 Practice exam features content very similar to what a person could encounter on an actual Level 1 exam. The structure of the Level 1 Practice exam is 14 rules questions (testing on the Magic Comprehensive Rules) and 6 policy questions (testing on the Magic Tournament Rules and Magic Infraction Procedure Guide). The division of questions on the Level 1 Practice exam reflects the division of questions on the Level 1 exam. However, the actual Level 1 exam is 50 questions long, rather than 20. A passing score on the Level 1 Practice exam is 70%, which is the same as a passing score on the actual Level 1 exam. Should you pass the Level 1 Practice exam, your profile in the Judge Center is updated to indicate your success.


The Level 1 Practice exam can be taken open book and a candidate may refer to any of the above documents while taking the exam. We simply ask that you refrain from discussing the questions or scenarios from your exam with anyone, other than your judge mentor or Judge Center personnel. Under no circumstance should content from the exam be reposted elsewhere, just as with any other Judge Center exam. (If you encounter any problems with content on your exam, you may submit feedback on that content as normal, which will be handled by one of the Judge Center volunteers.) The current Oracle text for any cards on the exam is provided, and is displayed with each question. A link to Gatherer is also provided. Otherwise, the information provided in each question is the only information necessary to answer the question. Candidates may refer to the "Instructions" for every exam regarding the basic presumptions they can make when taking the test.


The Level 1 Practice exam requires that a person have passed the Rules Advisor exam. Interested users should also start with the Easy Practice exam first, even before taking the Rules Advisor exam. This progression gives users a basic exposure to the formatting of content as it will appear on exams, and steps up the difficulty of the content a user could encounter. Is the Level 1 Practice a significantly harder exam than Easy Practice? Not really, but there is some progression to the content and what a candidate will be asked to identify. So, if you are a new user, please take an Easy Practice exam or two and become more familiar with how the exam process works in the Judge Center before starting with the Rules Advisor exam.


Passing the Level 1 Practice exam is not a requirement to either take the Level 1 exam or otherwise become a certified judge. The requirements to become a Level 1 judge arehere, and do not include a passing score on the Level 1 Practice exam. The Level 1 Practice exam is simply a resource to help you prepare for the actual Level 1 exam. The expectation is that a passing score on the Level 1 Practice exam provides some assurance that a person has the knowledge to be successful on the actual Level 1 exam, but failure on the Level 1 Practice exam is not intended to be a bar to taking the Level 1 exam. Use any failure as an opportunity to learn, by reviewing the questions that you missed, the explanation to those questions, and the rules or policies referenced in the explanation. If you are still confused, please submit feedback to Judge Center personnel.


The Level 1 Practice exam can only be taken once every two to three months. There is a limited amount of content in the pool and we want candidates to experience fresh content every time the exam is taken. Furthermore, we want to prevent people from "farming" the content just to see everything in the pool. These measures preserve the value of the exam for all candidates, as well as stem the leak of content from the Judge Center. So, you need to be careful about when you decide to take the Level 1 Practice exam. As always, feel free to utilize either the Easy Practice or Hard Practice exams to study more.


The Level 1 Practice exam is intended as a tool, among many others, to help a candidate prepare for the Level 1 exam. Someone interested in becoming a certified judge should still use the "Find Judges Near You" link in the "People" section of the Judge Center to find a nearby judge to start the certification process. Mentoring directly with that judge is an invaluable resource, as it can given you opportunities to discuss rules or policies you might have trouble understanding. The Level 1 Practice exam can help identify rules or policies that you don't quite understand and need further help with. Make a note of the citations provided in the explanation to ask your mentor about.


It is also important for Level 2+ judges to keep performance on the Level 1 Practice exam in perspective. It is not recommended to test someone for Level 1 solely on the basis of that person's performance on the Level 1 Practice exam (or even the Rules Advisor exam). Absence of a passing score on the Level 1 Practice exam should simply show that a candidate may need more preparation. The exact content may help indicate what material a candidate needs help with in order to be prepared. It is more important to get to know your candidate and screen him or her directly to determine how prepared he or she is to take the Level 1 exam. Take the time to interview your candidate to assess where his or her strengths and weaknesses lie, as well as find ways to help him or her prepare for success on the Level 1 exam. Make sure you are preparing your candidate not just to pass the exam, but also to be a successful judge.


In conclusion, everyone in the DCI wants all individuals interested in becoming a certified judge to be successful and have the resources available to ensure success. The Level 1 Practice Exam is just one such resource to help you prepare.
