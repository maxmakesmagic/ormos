Grand Prix Barcelona 2014
-------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpbar14/trophyshot.jpg)One week after Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* in nearby Valencia, thousands of players had traveled to Barcelona for a weekend of *Born of the Gods*/*Theros* Team Limited, including several of **Magic**'s biggest names: For example (18) Martin Jůza, Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, and (9) Shuhei Nakamura teamed up to reach place 13, Raphaël Lévy, Melissa DeTora, and (1) Jérémy Dezani finished the tournament in seventh place, and (4) Reid Duke, (3) Owen Turtenwald, and William Jensen made it all the way to the semifinals. They were the big favorites going into the playoffs, but their run was cut short by Swiss team Olivier Duport, Wilson Lam, and Louis Ballivet.


Meanwhile, in the other semifinal, brothers Daniel and Tobias Gräfensteiner, playing with Christian Seibold, had bested brothers Manuel and Christan Hauck, playing with Stephan Schwarz. After one more draft, the Gräfensteiners and Seibold were again victorious, sweeping the final 2-0, in fact repeating their semifinal result. In both rounds, there was no need to even finish the third match.


For Seibold, this was the second big success within just a few days. At the Pro Tour, he had made it all the way to the quarterfinals, now it was finally his time to hoist the trophy. Congratulations to Daniel Gräfensteiner, Christian Seibold, and Tobias Gräfensteiner, champions of Grand Prix Barcelona 2014!
