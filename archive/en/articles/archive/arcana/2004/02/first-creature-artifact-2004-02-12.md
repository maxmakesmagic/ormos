Recent cards like [Chimeric Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chimeric+Egg) and [Darksteel Brute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Brute) are inheritors of a long tradition of artifacts that can temporarily become creatures. Way back in *Alpha*, **Magic**'s first set, [Jade Statue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jade+Statue) began that tradition.

Today, the rules for such artifact-to-creature changes are well-established (as are those for [Stalking Stones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Stalking%2BStones), [Hidden Gibbons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Hidden%2BGibbons), [Myr Landshaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Myr%2BLandshaper), [Convulsing Licid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Convulsing%2BLicid) and other crazy transformations). But back in [Jade Statue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jade+Statue)'s days, things weren't as well ironed out. 

In fact, it was printed as a non-creature artifact *that had power and toughness* to represent its ability:

[Animate Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Animate%2BWall) and [sabretooth tiger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=sabretooth%2Btiger).
