Welcome back to "On the Mirrodin Site," where we show off some of the recent highlights from the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/).

Because this is the final installment this year, we're going to do things a little differently. And by that we mean that we're not going to give you individual highlights at all. Because the Mirrodin Site is stuffed to bursting with updates! Field Reports from both Mirrans and Phyrexians? They're there. Art, flavor, and card names from upcoming sets? Also there! And a general sense of the progress of the war between the Phyrexians and the Mirrans? The site is positively suffused with it!

So this time, instead of giving you specific directions, we encourage you to go to the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/) and poke around. Go to all five lands. Examine both the Mirran and Phyrexian angles. We promise you'll find something you haven't seen before. And when you've got the feel of the place, pick a side! [Join the Mirrans](http://www.facebook.com/pages/mirrodin-faction/111175072274346) and their resistance, or [join the Phyrexians](http://www.facebook.com/pages/phyrexian-faction/144426112262398) and their invasion.

See you next year!
