So cute. I'd gladly adopt that little guy. Maybe trade him for my dog.


He's wearing a frog-suit and ... is that a tail? Did he just place a glowing mushroom on a turtle? Simply adorable.

[Gilder Bairn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilder+Bairn) appears in many casual decks, because of the unique counter-doubling ability. Double your planeswalker loyalty counters? No problem. Give all your elves a bump by doubling [Joraga Warcaller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joraga+Warcaller)'s +1/+1 counters? Sure. Don't have enough red mana to get [Kargan Dragonlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kargan+Dragonlord) to level 8 fast enough? [Gilder Bairn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilder+Bairn) to the rescue! Doubling not your thing? Why not triple your counters with [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) also in play?


I'm not the only one with a soft spot for this delightful ouphe; Noel deCordova is tickled by [Gilder Bairn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilder+Bairn) and has featured the card in his [From the Lab column](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?tag=FromtheLab&description=House%20of%20Cards) repeatedly—as often as he can, I suspect. Similarly smitten, I sneak him into article images [I design](/en/articles/archive/magic-dossier-tom-jenkot-2009-03-03) as frequently as possible, perhaps in some instances you may have overlooked.


Here we see our forest-decorating friend gazing at an [Braid of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Braid%2Bof%2BFire).
