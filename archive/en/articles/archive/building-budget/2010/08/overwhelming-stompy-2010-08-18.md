Overwhelming Stompy

By Jacob Van Lunen




Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 







Aggressive green decks that finish with [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) have been a part of casual and competitive **Magic** since the release of *Tempest* back in late 1997. [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) has always been one of the most powerful Limited cards available in any given set that it has been printed in. The new core set introduces the latest, perhaps greatest, [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effect. [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede) is a beautifully designed card. The flavor is spot on, the effect is powerful enough for Constructed play, and the artwork makes every old-school player remember that they used to play 8/4 trample creatures for eight mana and be happy about it. (Remember *Mirage*?)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab104_over.jpg)I knew [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede) was good, but I didn't realize just how unfair the card could be until I had it in a draft deck on **Magic Online** earlier this week. Literally 100% of games where I drew [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede) were won very easily. It's pretty easy to engineer a turn where that type of effect will win you the game in a Limited match. As a side note, I've noticed that winning matches in the new core set Draft format is very dependent on the number of creatures you play. I haven't had any trouble winning games with draft decks that feature seventeen or more creatures. Getting a chance to sling some [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede) was enough to get me excited about including it in a Standard deck.


I had forgotten about [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) Green strategies until Zvi Mowshowitz introduced me to an exciting [Beastmaster Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension) deck for the last Block Constructed Pro Tour. Looking through [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx), I was pleasantly surprised to see how many awesome tricks are available for this type of strategy. [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) is a far more attainable card now that it has been printed in a few sets and been given out as a promotional card for Xbox LIVE **Magic** players. Even classic [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) is still legal until *Scars of Mirrodin* hits the shelves in October.

Llanowar Elves
 | 
Arbor Elf
 |

[Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf) both accomplish the same goal here. An [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) Green deck wants to present a lot of creatures very quickly and force its opponent to make unfavorable blocks. Once the board is reasonably clogged the [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) green deck can easily break a stalemate with its [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effects. [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf) allow the [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) Green deck to accelerate into threats in the early stages of the game. As the game progresses, [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf) both act as reasonable threats when paired with the [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effects.


[Leatherback Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leatherback+Baloth) is a very efficient green fatty. It works very well with our [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede). Playing eight one-mana accelerants makes [Leatherback Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leatherback+Baloth) even more impressive. He enters the battlefield on the second turn in a remarkable percentage of games.

Nest Invader
 | 
Kozilek's Predator
 |

[Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) is one of the greatest unsung heroes from *Rise of Eldrazi*. It presents two bodies for a single card, which only increases in value as you play more [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effects. It also allows its controller to accelerate into turn four [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effects that can be followed up with turn five [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effects. Remember, we're going to play with a lot of [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)s.


[Kozilek's Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator) is [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader)'s big brother. It accomplishes the same goals and occupies a different spot on the curve. A single [Kozilek's Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator) can often present a lethal board when combined with [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun), or [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede).


[Garruk's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion) is another gem that hasn't seen its day in the sun yet. Deals don't get much better than a 3/2 trampler for two-mana. Cards like [Garruk's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion) ensure that our [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede) isn't a dead card.

Wolfbriar Elemental
 | 
Garruk's Companion
 |

[Wolfbriar Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfbriar+Elemental) lets us get back on the table after [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment). The sheer number of guys that this card can produce makes this card an automatic inclusion in the deck. I never liked drawing [Wolfbriar Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfbriar+Elemental) in my opening hand, though, so I decided to only play two copies of the top-end finisher.


[Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun), [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede), and [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) let us finish off opponents out of nowhere. It's important to note that [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede) combos very well with Garruk's ultimate ability. I had many games where I was able to activate Garruk's ultimate with a few creatures on the table and follow it up with an [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede) for +6/+6 or +7/+7 to my whole team.


[Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden) makes it in as our non-basic land of choice because it gives us an extra body to crash into the red zone with our [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effects.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab104_Khalni_Garden.jpg)Here's the deck once it's completed. The only card that may be difficult to acquire is [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker). You can replace the [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker)s with more [Wolfbriar Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfbriar+Elemental)s and a fourth [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede) if you are unable to get your hands on all three copies of the card.

I played a few games with the deck to see how it fared against what people are playing these days in Standard.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab104_thri.jpg)I won the roll and kept [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Leatherback Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leatherback+Baloth), [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), and three [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s. I cast [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Lavaclaw Reaches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaclaw+Reaches) and passed the turn. I drew [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede), played my land, cast [Leatherback Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leatherback+Baloth), and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Savage Lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Lands) and passed the turn. I drew a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played my land, attacked for 4 with my [Leatherback Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leatherback+Baloth), cast [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), untapped two lands, cast [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Verdant Catacombs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs), popped it, and cast a [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax) before passing the turn. I drew an [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun), played my land, activated Garruk's ultimate, cast [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede), and attacked for 36 trampling damage. Boom!


Jund is probably a very good match-up with this deck, especially if they don't [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) your mana creatures. Jund is forced to tap out often enough that an [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effect is bound to close the game at some point.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab104_jura.jpg)I won the play again and kept [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf), [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), [Kozilek's Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator), [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), [Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden), and two [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s. I cast my [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf) and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and passed the turn back. I drew [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun), played my [Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden), cast [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Glacial Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Fortress), cast [Wall of Omens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens), and passed the turn. I drew [Garruk's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion), played my land, and cast [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker). I used Garruk to untap two lands, cast [Garruk's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion), and passed the turn. My opponent cast an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) targeting my [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) and passed the turn back. I drew another [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), attacked with my team, cast [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), untapped two lands, and passed the turn. My opponent cast [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) and passed the turn back. I drew [Leatherback Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leatherback+Baloth), cast it, made a 3/3 with [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), and passed the turn. My opponent cast [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), demanded that all creatures attack it, and passed the turn. I drew [Wolfbriar Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfbriar+Elemental), used Garruk to untap two lands and cast [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun), attacked Gideon for lethal, and passed the turn. My opponent cast another [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) and a [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) on one of my lands. I drew a forest, played it, tapped all my lands for mana, untapped two lands with [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), and cast [Wolfbriar Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfbriar+Elemental) kicked three times. My opponent drew for his turn, played a land, and passed the turn. I drew [Kozilek's Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator), and attacked with my team. I cast [Kozilek's Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator), which was [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed, made a 3/3 with Garruk, and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity) on my end step.


My opponent wasted no time untapping and casting a [Martial Coup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martial+Coup) for six. I drew a [Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden), played it, made a 3/3, and passed the turn. My opponent attacked [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) with four tokens and I ate one with my Beast token. He cast another [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), demanded that all my creatures attack it, and passed the turn. I drew a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), attacked with my Beast and Plant, the plant was eaten by a token and Gideon took 3. I passed the turn. My opponent turned Gideon into a creature, attacked for 11, cast [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), bounced my beast, and passed the turn. I drew a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and conceded.


It's no secret that [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) is very good against [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)-themed decks. My deck's purpose is to overextend in the early stages of the game. My opponent was lucky to have drawn two copies of [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) followed by a [Martial Coup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martial+Coup), but a single [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) with a healthy dose of countermagic probably would have had a very similar effect.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab104_kargan.jpg)I lost the roll, mulliganed, and kept [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf), [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf), [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), [Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden), [Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden), and a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). My opponent played a mountain and passed the turn. I drew a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played it, cast [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf), and passed the turn. My opponent dispatched the [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf) with a [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) on my end step. My opponent cast a [Kargan Dragonlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kargan+Dragonlord) and passed the turn. I drew a [Wolfbriar Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfbriar+Elemental), played a [Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden), cast [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf), and passed the turn. My opponent played a third land, cast [Searing Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze) on the [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf), and attacked for 2. The Dragonlord got leveled once, and then my opponent passed the turn. I drew a [Leatherback Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leatherback+Baloth), played my [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), cast the [Leatherback Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leatherback+Baloth), and passed the turn.


My opponent played his fourth land, leveled the [Kargan Dragonlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kargan+Dragonlord) three times, attacked for 4, then leveled the [Kargan Dragonlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kargan+Dragonlord) a fifth time, and passed the turn. I drew an [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun), played another [Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden), attacked for 4 with my [Leatherback Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leatherback+Baloth), cast [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), and passed the turn. My opponent leveled his [Kargan Dragonlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kargan+Dragonlord) three times, attacked for 8, and finished me off with a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt).


Red will probably be a bad match-up for us. Post-board they get to upgrade to [Cunning Sparkmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage) and play extra [Kargan Dragonlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kargan+Dragonlord)s, which are very strong against us. [Leatherback Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leatherback+Baloth) is very strong here, but the red decks ability to disrupt our board presence while attacking our life total makes this seem like an uphill battle.

My opponent played a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and passed the turn. I drew an [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf), played a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), cast the [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf), and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) and passed the turn.

My opponent cast a [Cultivate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) and passed the turn back to me. I drew a [Wolfbriar Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfbriar+Elemental), played a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), cast [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), attacked for 4, untapped two lands with Garruk, cast [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) and passed the turn. I used the ultimate on [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), cast [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede), and attacked for an absurd amount of damage. My opponent conceded.


It has become very clear that the [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) Green deck's best draws are nigh unbeatable. [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) decks don't have a lot of ways to interact with our board. We should do very well in these types of matches.


That went pretty well! The [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) Green deck seems very well positioned if people at your local store tend to play with Jund and [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) decks more than White-Blue Control and red decks. The deck seems to race Mythic Conscription at about even pace. Our [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effects tend to be more devastating than their [Sovereigns of Lost Alara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara), but their ability to stick the Conscription on a lifelink creature gives them a nice bonus. I think the match-up should be about even, perhaps a little in favor of the Green Stompy deck.


As always, I'd love to hear your questions or comments on the forums or in an email!


Happy Brewing!
