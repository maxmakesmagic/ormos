Over the weekend, we held a Worldbuilding Panel at PAX featuring members of the *Khans of Tarkir* creative team. The panel itself was standing room only, but that doesn't mean you can't get a front-row seat for the presentation, previewed artwork, and question-and-answer session. You can view the entire hour-long session below.
