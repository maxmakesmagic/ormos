The February 24, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 24, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [*Conspiracy*, of which there totally isn't one. Nothing going on here. Move along](#conspiracy).


Today's Must
============


1. [Commander VS: Ravnica Legends!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32451_Commander-VS-Ravnica-Legends.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

I'll admit, I'm kind of in love with these themed Commander Vs. videos. There's a ton of fun and flavor to be had by battling legends from the same block against one another. Here, the Gruul ([Ulasht, the Hate Seed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulasht%2C+the+Hate+Seed)) take on Simic ([Vorel of the Hull Clade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vorel+of+the+Hull+Clade)), the Dimir ([Mirko Vosk, Mind Drinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirko+Vosk%2C+Mind+Drinker)), and the Orzhov ([Ghost Council of Orzhova](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Council+of+Orzhova), obviously).


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [MTG Artists Gain Playmats](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/mikelinnemann-022416-mtg-artists-gain-playmats/) | Gathering Magic | Mike Linnemann

It's true! Thanks to a deal with Ultra PRO, artists can now produce playmats with some of their art on them! More details will be forthcoming from Ultra PRO, but Linneman has an early look at the news on Gathering Magic.


1. [Channel Reid—Standard Esper Control](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-reid-standard-esper-control/) | ChannelFireball | Reid Duke

And now for something a little different in Standard, as Reid Duke walks through his Esper Control deck and shows off a Daily Event on *Magic Online*. Esper Control hasn't exactly been the most popular deck in Standard, but Reid is a big fan, and he shows us why in this series of videos. Plus, the deck includes [Narset Transcendent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset+Transcendent), so it gets a thumbs up from me.


1. [History of the Eldrazi Winter 101 and Reprint Policy 304 with The Professor](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/11211) | Masters of Modern | Alex Kessler and Ben Bateman

The Professor is becoming a pretty popular person to patronize podcasts. Here, he and the Masters of Modern crew teach a few lessons on the current Eldrazi takeover of Modern as well as advanced reprintology.


1. [MtA Episode 161: Workin' on a Hell Farm](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-episode-161-workin-on-a-hell-farm/) | Magic the Amateuring | Meghan Wolff and Maria Bartholdi

Meghan and Maria torture themselves—or treat themselves, depending on your point of view—with old *Magic* rules text (have you seen [Ice Cauldron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cauldron)?!). They also look ahead to Standard for [Grand Prix Houston](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gphou16) (this weekend!) and Team Sealed for [Grand Prix Washington, D.C.](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpdc16)

1. Quick, Nobody Move!

No pro-level events means no points. No points means no changes. That is all.


Well, not *all* all. I'll use this opportunity to say that Rich Hagon used to write these every week before they were incorporated into the Daily *Magic* Update, and, because it was a standalone article, Rich always had to find something to say. It's days like this that make me realize how difficult a job that could be.


But me? I can just say "Yo, nothing has changed. Move along." And then we do.

Whew. Okay everyone, I got everything fixed after that [odd nonsense about Brago](https://twitter.com/Wizards_MagicEU/status/702161242903937026) being stabbed by that mysterious and clearly powerful woman. We've [updated the announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-conspiracy-2), and the set is now called *Conspiracy: The Empty Throne*. Brago's dead, so clearly there's one less card, too.


This will definitely be our last update of the latest *Conspiracy*set. Well, probably. I mean, if you can't count on immortal ghost kings, everything kind of starts to look a little shaky.

It's true! The long-awaited Sealed League format will be available to play on *Magic Online* in just one week!


What's a Sealed League? Your best resource is [the article where we announced them](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/waiting-hardest-part-2016-02-24) (up today!), but let me sum it up for you. You start out with a normal Sealed pool (six packs). You can then build and play matches at your leisure. Jonesing for a pack-cracking rush but can't build right now? Sealed Leagues! Want to grind a million Sealed pools as quickly as possible? Sealed Leagues! Just finish your first match and notice your home is on fire. Sealed Leagues! Also, the fire department!


*9.*[*Magic Online* Tumblr](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/)


Speaking of *Magic Online*, Lee Sharpe, digital product manager of *Magic Online*, was home sick yesterday. Not that that much affects you, except it means he had a little extra time to answer questions about *Magic Online*. With all the answers he threw out, you might wish every day was a Lee Sharpe sick day!


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Dark Dwelling](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-daily-2016-02-23)

While looking for a Deck of the Day for today, it quickly became apparent I had my choice of a variety of decks—just so long as I wanted a [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers) deck.


List after list I spotted sported some number of the darkest of dwellers, which seems to be taking over Standard. So I went with a deck that played the full four.


[RVNG went 3-1 in a Standard Daily Event on Feb. 22](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-daily-2016-02-23), and did so playing "only" three colors, something of a monumental feat in Standard right now. He chose to ally with the Mardu clan, and battered and bruised and attritioned his way to a winning record. The deck is reminiscent of Jund strategies that use powerful removal and powerful creatures to incrementally gain advantage. However, in the four-color Standard we have, most player have been using [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) alongside their [Crackling Doom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom)s. But not RVNG. He's pretty happy with just Dark-Dwelling them back. That gives him more room for [Hangarback Walker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) and [Ayli, Eternal Pilgrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ayli%2C+Eternal+Pilgrim), plus a few [Seeker of the Way](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way)s and [Pia and Kiran Nalaar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pia+and+Kiran+Nalaar)s. Main deck [Radiant Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames) is an intriguing idea, though it both kills several of the deck's creatures and doesn't work with [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers), so who knows.
