Two*Time Spiral* uncommons share a curious link, even deeper than their mechanical similarities would suggest.




![Krosan Grip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Krosan+Grip)

![Return to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Return+to+Dust)

These two spells both blow up artifacts or enchantments—classic [Disenchant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant)/[Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) effects with *Time Spiral* twists. But check out the cards' art—in each piece, the *same sword* is being destroyed. In [Return to Dust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Return+to+Dust) it's crumbling into particles; in [Krosan Grip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Grip) it's seen with the "jump-cut" [split second visual cue](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1180) between shiny and whole on the one side, and rotten by nature on the other.


But look closer. The swords were illustrated by different artists and vary on a couple of details, but obviously share the same design. Here we've rotated Wayne Reynolds's [Return to Dust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Return+to+Dust) piece ninety degrees so you can focus on the similarities.

What's the meaning of the same sword appearing on these two [Disenchant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant) effects? How can the same sword be destroyed multiple times? It's a mystery that may be solved sometime in the future.
