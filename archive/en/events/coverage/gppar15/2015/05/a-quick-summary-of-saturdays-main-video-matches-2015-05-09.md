Most of Saturday's rounds were streamed live on Twitch. To give you a quick impression of the players, decks, and matches that we've seen throughout the day, here is a quick summary of all the main video matches. Be sure to check in to the stream ([www.twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic)) tomorrow for more!

*Round 4: Nicolas Vanderhallen (Sidisi Megamorph) vs. Marco Cammilluzzi (Abzan Control)*



Belgian National champion Vanderhallen defeated Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* Top 8 competitor Cammilluzzi 2-0. It wasn't close, as the Abzan deck couldn't beat the value [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) and [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) generated in the late game.

*Round 5: Antonio Del Moral León (Abzan Control)* vs. *Javier Dominguez (Green/White Company)*



Champion of Grand Prix Paris 2014 Dominguez triumphed over Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* champion Del Moral León 2-0. [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) looked to be everywhere this round.

*Round 6: Jérémy Dezani (Mardu Dragons) vs. Gonzague Allouchery (Abzan Control)*



Dezani beat Allouchery 2-0 on the back of [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) and [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent). Allouchery's [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow) and [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) were too awkward against a deck that attacked his life total so aggressively with haste creatures.

*Round 7: Javier Dominguez (Green/White Company) vs. Ondřej Stráský (Esper Dragons)*



This match between two players at 5-1 records was a slaughterfest, and it was over in, like, five minutes, with Dominguez winning 2-0 over Stráský. The highlight was when [Hidden Dragonslayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Dragonslayer) slayed [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai).

*Round 8: Julien Nemeghaire (Mardu Dragons vs. Yohan Dudognon (Four-Color Company))*



We got to see an absolute masterpiece of a deck here. [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider), [Savage Knuckleblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Knuckleblade), and [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company)? Yes please! Dudognon used these cards to defeat Nemeghaire 2-0, advancing to 8-0 and leaving behind a flustered opponent.

*Round 9: Robin Dolar (Esper Dragons) vs. Yohan Dudognon (Four-Color Company)*



After winning Round 8, Dudognon now faced Grand Prix Kraków finalist Robin Dolar in a battle of the undefeateds. Dolar took game one by stealing [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) with Ashiok, [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) Weaver. Dudognon then won game two by making the flavor-dubious but effective play of countering [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) with [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command). And then, out of all creatures in the four-colored [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) deck, it was a 1/1 Goblin token provided by [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) that saved Dudognon from [Foul-Tongue Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foul-Tongue+Invocation) and carried him toward the perfect 9-0!
