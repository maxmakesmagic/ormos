Patrick "Trick" Jarrett oversees web content and social media for Magic, and acts as the publisher of DailyMTG.com and Magic content on the web. He's an ardent Commander player and lover of the game he's played since Ice Age. 






Today I want to try something new with the Arcana column I'm calling "Artist Focus." The idea is that I will pick an artist and show you all the works by that artist in a specific set. Now, I'm no art critic, and I'm not a member of the creative team, so I will display this art without comment and simply let you enjoy the wonderful work by our artists.

First up is a relative newcomer to **Magic**'s artist lineup, Adam Paquette.
