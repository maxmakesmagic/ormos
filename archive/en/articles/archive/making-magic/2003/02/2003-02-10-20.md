R&D looks at the rumor sites very differently from the rest of the world. Everyone else goes to rumor sites to see what unknown information they can learn about upcoming **Magic** products. R&D goes to see what the public does and doesn’t know. You see, we know when something is true or not, so it’s great for us to see what the public will and won’t believe.
