Grand Prix Pittsburgh 2013
--------------------------


Parker Makes Proud Return in Pittsburgh
=======================================




March 23-24, 2013












GRAND PRIX PITTSBURG 2013
-------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppit13/brockparker_winner.jpg)One of the Brockafellers has just made a comeback at Grand Prix Pittsburgh! Brock Parker has returned from years past to show the **Magic** world that the greats aren't ready to retire just yet. After earning his first Grand Prix Top 8 since 2003 in Columbus, Parker crafted the ultimate Orzhov deck, and it was through the Orzhov's extort mechanic that he won his final match against Alec Nezin by extorting all 20 points of life from his opponent in the final game!


This win at Grand Prix Pittsburgh is Parker's second Grand Prix victory, added to an impressive resume that includes six Grand Prix Top 8s and a victory at Pro Tour Boston in 2003, where he took down the tournament with teammates William Jensen and Matt Linde.


With *Gatecrash* explored inside and out, and Orzhov shining with the brutally powerful extort mechanic, players can look forward to how the *Return to Ravnica* Block will change as *Dragon's Maze* approaches. Which guild will rise above the rest as we approach Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze*?


But that's the future. For now, it's time to enjoy the moments that have taken place this weekend. Congratulations to Brock Parker, Grand Prix Pittsburgh champion!
