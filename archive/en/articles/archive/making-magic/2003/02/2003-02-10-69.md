You have a rep for heartily jumping into every discussion. Usually at some point in every meeting you and some other R&D member (more often than not Randy) get into some loud screaming match where you go in circles about the same topic. After a numerous minutes either Henry Stern or Worth Wollpert stop the argument by screaming, “You’re killing me!”


The best thing about the **Magic** meeting is that it allows all of us to get on the same page. Key arguments are covered and everyone learns where everyone else stands. This is the place, for example, that we’ve done all our color pie discussions.


After some heated discussions and a half dozen “You’re killing me!”'s, the meeting comes to an end.
