At the Prereleases for *Return to Ravnica* and *Gatecrash*, when players opened their guild packs, they were greeted with a letter welcoming them to the guild. If you went to a Prerelease, you probably remember this.

These letters are pretty clever. Everything from the wording to the typography conveys the values and beliefs of each guild. So let's look at them now!
