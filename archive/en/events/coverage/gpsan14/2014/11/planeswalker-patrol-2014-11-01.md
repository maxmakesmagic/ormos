November 1, 2014
 










Two weeks, two tournaments, and a world away ago in Los Angeles, I was deep in conversation with a Hall of Famer. I explained my grand plan to do an article at Grand Prix Santiago, that would go into the inner workings of all the Planeswalkers in Standard. Which to play, when to play them, when to let them die, when to offer them up as bait, when to counter them, when to up them, when to down them, when to ultimate them...this would be a truly useful guide to those of us who are still befuddled by what is – let's be honest – the class of permanent we have least experience in playing with, or against.


The Hall of Famer, who shall remain nameless to protect the guilty, sat in silence for a time, and then explained (in not so many words) that *another* Hall of Famer had tried something similar, and that it had been an admirable attempt, but it wasn't something that *he* would be looking to write any time soon. So, [Hubris](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hubris) is more than just a card name, but when two Hall of Famers aren't enough to write an article properly, one Newsdesk anchor probably won't be either.


And yet I still want to talk about Planeswalkers, precisely because they are indeed the rarest of permanents. Very few players truly understand how they work, and that's just when you're dealing with one of them on your own side of the table. Once there are Planeswalkers on *both* sides, the intricacies just keep on multiplying. If there's one thing I've learned from watching this Standard at Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, Grand Prix Los Angeles, Grand Prix Stockholm, and now here at Grand Prix Santiago, it's that Planeswalkers *matter*. Know what you're doing with them, and the right loyalty can lead to game win after game win. Few areas of the game offer more opportunity to outwit your opponents.


And so, certain that Planeswalkers would play a big part this weekend, I stepped out into the fray of more than 600 players. Which Planeswalkers would we find on the battlefield? Here's the evidence:




---


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW-1.jpg)*It's dice all over the battlefield, as [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) (bottom) and [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) (top) go to work.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW-2.jpg)*Either [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) has been in play for a while, or she's probably activated her middle ability.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW-3.jpg)*It's Planeswalker central in this one. With [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster) and [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) already in the graveyard, we all know that another [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster) is on the way. Thanks, [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), we love surprises.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW-4.jpg)*There are three very powerful cards here, and killing [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) is going to be pretty tough.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW-5.jpg)*More middle ability action from [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion), as [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) (plus friend) take to the skies.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW-6.jpg)*So who wins this battle? On the right, [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster), while on the left it's the first appearance of [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor).* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_7.jpg)*Rather better than having one Planeswalker on each side of the battlefield is getting greedy and having two Planeswalkers just for you. Sure, [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) may be ticking down, but [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) is in great shape.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_8.jpg)*It's action shot time. Thanks to the [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) on the right of your screen, we knew that moments ago that card going into hand was a [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster). It's just like watching it live!* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_9.jpg)*There's a lot to like in this one. There are awesome sleeves. There's a [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor). And there's a cute baby Vampire.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_10.jpg)*[Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) and [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster) get ready to go at it once again, with plenty of support on both sides.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_11.jpg)*Now that's a healthy-looking [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker). Are we expecting emblems any time soon?* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/Pw_12.jpg)*Wow! Now that was unexpected. This wasn't at one of the absolute highest tables, more the middle of the room, but still – [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave), ladies and gentlemen.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_13.jpg)*And here's our first sighting of [Ajani, Mentor of Heroes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Mentor+of+Heroes). Go on, you've got 8 counters on there, gain 100 life, I double dog whipped cream on top dare you.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_14.jpg)*For a moment, I thought we were going to get [Ajani, Mentor of Heroes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Mentor+of+Heroes) going ultimate on two tables next to each other. Then this one hit the graveyard. What kind of loyalty is that? (Zero, is the answer.)* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_15.jpg)*Apparently, in Spanish, Nissa has been doing some desertadora-ing, which probably involves rising from slumber. In any case, [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker), joining the Planeswalker party.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_16.jpg)*Another addition to the ranks, and it's an oldie but goodie. Welcome [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess), who has just made an opponent discard a card. She does that. You can see it right there.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/Pw_17.jpg)*In truth, I haven't shown every single Planeswalker in play this round, but I did want to draw your attention to the fact that [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) has come to play at a lot of tables this weekend, and that's not something I've seen at any of the earlier Standard events this season.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_18.jpg)*Ah, the joys of Blue-White control. I can almost taste the [Elixir of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality), the [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), and the [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation). (Sob).* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_19.jpg)*Now that's what I call a board state. [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) on 2, [Ajani, Mentor of Heroes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Mentor+of+Heroes) on 8, [Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver) on the other side of the board on 5, and a fourth Planeswalker peeking out from underneath Ashiok. Think Planeswalkers aren't a big deal in Standard? Think again.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_20.jpg)*Looking to break the pattern [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) on both sides? This player couldn't wait to show me his [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker). Then again, she has been signed by the artist.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_21.jpg)*See, this one isn't fair. We've got [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor), he's making Vampires, and we've used [Banishing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light) to get rid of [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker). As I said, not fair.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_22.jpg)*This is what happens when you let [Ajani, Mentor of Heroes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Mentor+of+Heroes) get away from you. So. Many. Dice.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_23.jpg)*There are some big players on the battlefield in this one. [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) faces off against [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor), but the supporting cast includes [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) and [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost).* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_24.jpg)*This was only the second [Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver) I could find. Which is a shame, as I like Ashiok quite a bit.* 







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_25.jpg)*I wasn't expecting to see as much of Nissa. Worldwaker as I did. But, here she is again, doing her thing.*







---



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsan14/PW_26.jpg)*And finally, the most talismanic Planeswalker in the room.*
