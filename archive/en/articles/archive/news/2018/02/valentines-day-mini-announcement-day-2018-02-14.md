We like you, we really do. So much, in fact, that we have a Valentine's Day gift for you—information!


Okay, so it's not the most romantic of gestures, but it's the thought that counts, right?


Here's the deal: We're cooking up a big Announcement Day sometime after the release of *Dominaria* but before we get all the way to *Core Set 2019*. That Announcement Day will look deeper into *Magic*'s future and what plane or planes we'll be visiting after said core set. We'll make a whole to-do about it. Yes, we're announcing another announcement. It's kind of our thing.


In the meantime, we don't want to leave you hanging on some of the cool supplementary products coming out between now and the second half of the year. Because we like you.


So, until our star-crossed paths shall, um, cross again, here are the cool new products coming your way.


* Coming in 2018, *Magic: The Gathering* is getting its own life counter app that does so much more than just track your opponents' fall from 20 to 0. This new companion app will allow you to set up and organize home tournaments and invite friends to play in them, it will have a card lookup function, a news hub, a profile that tracks wins and losses over time, and much more. For the full announcement, [check the article posted today](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/CompanionApp).
* [*Signature Spellbook: Jace*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/Signature-Spellbook-Jace) is a spiritual successor to the *From the Vault* series, but with a signature twist: each *Signature Spellbook* is themed around a Planeswalker and the spells that define who they are. Jace Beleren, fresh off having his memory restored on Ixalan, has plenty in his arsenal. Each *Signature Spellbook* will contain one premium foil and eight cards that fit with the Planeswalker's identity. They will have an MSRP of $19.99 (applies to the United States only), and you can get your hands on them starting June 15, 2018, in English only.
* [*Battlebond*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/Battlebond) is a completely new booster release focused on Two-Headed Giant Limited play, releasing June 8, 2018. Yes, you read that correctly.

Here, let's [let product architect Gavin Verhey explain](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-battlebond-2018-02-14).


* Commander fans are getting a double dose of awesome this year. First, [*Commander Anthology Volume II*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/Commander-Anthology-2) releases June 8, 2018. Like the previous *Commander Anthology*, this box set contains four previously released 100-card decks, including thirteen premium foil commanders.
* Next up, we will again be releasing *new* *Commander* decks with [*Commander (2018 Edition)*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/Commander-2018). With a release date of August 10, 2018, there will be four new decks featuring twelve premium foil commanders.
* Finally, we're trying something a little new with a pair of [Chinese-market-specific Planeswalker Decks](https://magic.wizards.com/zh-hans/products/Global-Series-Jiang-Yanggu-and-Mu-Yanling) featuring new Planeswalkers created particularly for China. Now, don't worry, you'll have an opportunity to get [a similar English version of the same product](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/Global-Series-Jiang-Yanggu-and-Mu-Yanling) created for international audiences. Both will release on June 22, 2018.

That's it for now, but we'll let you know about the full Announcement Day and the exciting place or places *Magic* is going very soon!
