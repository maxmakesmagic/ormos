M19 Is Live
-----------


Core sets are back, and *Core Set 2019* events are available on *Magic Online* now. Your favorite legendary Dragons are back, and a new challenger approaches . . . drum roll please . . . Horse tribal!



For more info about M19 on MTGO, check out Alli Medwin's article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/core-set-2019-comes-magic-online-july-6-2018-06-28).

Team Standard Super League Tonight
----------------------------------


After many weeks of competition and entertainment, Team Standard Super League is drawing to a close. Join us for the finals, where the Brew Crew (Todd Stevens, SaffronOlive, and Corbin Hosler) will face off against Genesis (Corey Baumeister, Seth Manfield, and Brian Braun-Duin) for the championship. We can't predict the future, but we're pretty sure this will be some epic *Magic* action. Don't miss it!


TSSL airs tonight (Tuesday) at 5 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/).




---

Team Vintage Super League Thursday
----------------------------------


Get your weekly dose of ridiculously complex, powerful *Magic* every Thursday evening. The team-based deck-building rules and tournament structure make it even more interesting and unpredictable. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy TVSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about *Magic*'s most complicated format!


TVSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/format-details/).

In case you missed it, yesterday we published an article all about the future of Brawl, which will impact both paper *Magic* and MTGO. Read the full article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/checking-brawl-2018-07-09).
