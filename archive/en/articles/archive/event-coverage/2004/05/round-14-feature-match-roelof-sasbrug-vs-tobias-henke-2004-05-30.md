### Game 1


Tobias wins the toss but has to mulligan his opening 7. His 6 card hand is really good though as on turn 3 he already has 3 [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite)s and a Ravager. Roelof only has a [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) and a [Clickslither](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clickslither) to match the artifact creatures and is forced to make unfavourable blocks soon in order to stay alive. When his next draw doesn´t yield an answer, which problably is not in his deck, he is forced to concede.


1-0 to Tobias


Game 2


Roelof keeps but once again Tobias takes a trip to Paris, twice this time.  

Roelof starts off with a Sledder and a [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) which get [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm)ed on Tobias his second turn. No worries for the young dutchman though as he plays a Warchief, [Clickslither](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clickslither) and Siege-gang Commander. With his 2 mulligans and just an [Atog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) in play Tobias scoopes and a third game will have to decide who will advance to the top 8.


1-1


### Game 3


Yet again Tobias' first 7 cards are not quite what he was hoping for but he decides to take the gamble.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbru04/fm18_2.jpg)Although Tobias' draws are good Roelof seems to have all the answers in the beginning of the game: both Arbound Ravagers die and after having dealt with that Roelof lays down 2 Sharpshooters.


The only card he's unable to remove are Tobias´ Skullclamps. [Atog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) comes down for Tobias and with the help of the 2 Skullclamps he´s able to draw 4 cards. This gives him the [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) he needs to kill the Sharpshooters and clear the way for more creatures. With the insane amount of cards Tobias is able to draw it doesn´t take him long to finish Roelof off and advance to the top 8.
