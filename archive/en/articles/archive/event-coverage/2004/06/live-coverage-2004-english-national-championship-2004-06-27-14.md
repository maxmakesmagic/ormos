This matchup heavily favors the U/R [Obliterate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate) deck as the U/W deck struggles to kill fast enough to prevent [Obliterate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate) creating an insurmountable board position. ### Game 1


![Darksteel Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Darksteel+Gargoyle)
Neil mulligans down to 6 and the game starts slowly with each spell by Neil getting countered by a string of [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend)s and Mana leaks. Chester tries to finish Neil off before get can get to eight Mana with a two point cycled Decree of Justice and an Eternal Dragon. Chester attacks for 5 but has no more spells and continues to play out land, not preparing for [Obliterate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate). The last turn before Neil died he played a [Darksteel Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Gargoyle). Both players played nothing for a few turns and then Neil drew a 8th land and [Obliterate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate)d. Chester drew plenty of land afterwards but still died in 6 turns to the 3/3


### Game 2


Neil continues his poor luck with a mulligan down to 5 this time. This time the early game had even less action with Chester ramping up his mana with [Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble). Eventually Chester cycles a Decree of Justice but Neil has a Stifle for that exact purpose. In seeming fear of another Stifle Chester next casts a 2nd Decree of Justice but Neil has a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) for this expensive spell. Chester then tried to use an Akroma's [Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeance) to destroy one of Neil's lands and a counter war erupted over the spell with Neil's Discombulate being countered by a Mana leak. This however allowed Neil to untap and resolve a [Darksteel Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Gargoyle). Neil managed to get in for 3 before Chester tried again to cycle a Decree of Justice and again it got Stifled. However Chester drew very well first drawing his 4th Decree of Justice and which made him 2 angels and then a [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), which found a Eternal Dragon. Neil needs an answer fast and luckily top decked an [Obliterate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate) which instantly ended the game.


Neil Rigby wins 2-0
