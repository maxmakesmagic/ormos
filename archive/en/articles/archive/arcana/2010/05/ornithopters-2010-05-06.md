Hey! Let's talk [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter)s! They've been around almost as long as **Magic**, having appeared originally in *Antiquities*, when Amy Weber provided this basic blueprint.

That remained the standard look for [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter)s from *Fourth Edition* through *Classic Sixth Edition*. Then **Magic** had to live without [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter)s until *Mirrodin* brought Dana Knutson's version to life.

With *Ninth Edition*, Dana Knutson's [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) was in the core set, staying there through *Tenth Edition*. And then ***Magic** 2010* brought the most recent look. Franz Vohwinkel, take it away!

Who knows what [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter)s the future of **Magic** might hold?
