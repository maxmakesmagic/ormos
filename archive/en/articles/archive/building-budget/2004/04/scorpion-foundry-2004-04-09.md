I seem to get an endless stream of emails about this particular deck, so I have decided to write about it. This deck uses a fun infinite combo centered around [Dross Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Scorpion), [Soul Foundry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Foundry), and [Myr Moonvessel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Moonvessel). Many of you opted to use [Cathodion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion)s as well, but I ended up cutting them from my version of the deck. The general idea of the deck is to get a lot of strange and interesting interactions happening, and watch as they end in a dead opponent. The idea of defeating people with a card like [Dross Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Scorpion) has its merits as well.

Here is a rundown of the Combo in its purist form: Put a [Myr Moonvessel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Moonvessel) (or [Cathodion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion)) on a [Soul Foundry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Foundry). Have one [Dross Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Scorpion) in play. Make a guy with the foundry and then use some sacrifice effect to kill it, getting just enough mana to make another one, once your foundry becomes untapped from the Scorpion's effect. Repeat this as many times as you like to some effect. You can use the sacrifice effect to win with cards like [Carrion Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) or [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) (or [Goblin Bombardment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bombardment) for you old-school guys), or you can have a [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) in play.

Easy?

Well I was just getting warmed up.

Now try it with two [Dross Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Scorpion)s in play, and an artifact land ([Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod) will do fine). Now you are actually generating infinite mana if you use one of your untap effects on the artifact land and add a mana each loop. This can lead to drawing your whole deck if your sacrifice effect is a [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) on a Moonvessel. With infinite mana and your deck in your hands, you can do whatever you like…just make sure not to accidentally deck yourself with [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) – remember that the drawing of the cards is a “must” effect, not a “may” effect.

Let me iterate that this is a deck for casual play. It is much too slow of a combo for normal tournament play. There isn't much in the way of early game defense besides [Bottle Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+Gnomes). However, the deck has a lot of 1-drops overall, letting it do things in the early game, albeit unimpressive things until you get things rolling. 

In general, you want to start [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp)ing as soon as possible in order to find your combo parts and draw enough lands to do everything. Sometimes you will get lucky and draw a [Soul Foundry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Foundry) and a [Myr Moonvessel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Moonvessel) in your opening hand. If you have a [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp), it is often fine to play out your first Moonvessel on turn 1, planning to [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) it, banking on drawing another one by the time all your other combo pieces show up. Don't worry about clamping Engineers, [Carrion Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder)s, and Disciples as long as you have enough mana and/or backup copies. The Engineers are not essential at all, but they help take the pain out of casting a [Dross Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Scorpion).

Once you have a Moonvessel on the Foundry and a [Dross Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Scorpion) in play, you will want to find either a Carrion Feeder or a [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) will turn every one of your mana into “draw 2” letting you find another Scorpion easily so you can draw your deck by using the second Scorpion to untap an artifact land. A [Carrion Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) will let you make an arbitrarily large [Carrion Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder). If you have a [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) with the [Carrion Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) you will just win via Disciple damage (yes, the artifact tokens going to the graveyard trigger the Disciple…quashing question early).

### Tips on Playing the Deck

* While you want to save your Foundry for [Myr Moonvessel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Moonvessel), the other cool things to put on it are: [Bottle Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+Gnomes), [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) (sac my gnomes, you take 11), and [Dross Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Scorpion). Making multiple [Dross Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Scorpion)s gets craaaazy. You can actually go infinite off of making 5 [Dross Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Scorpion)s and having an artifact land. There is also one [Duplicant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant) to [Fabricate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate) for in case you feel the need to remove their team from the game.

| *Nervous gnomes…* |

* Don't forget that you can clamp up the Gnomes and sacrifice them to draw cards. Two clamps is even better.
* Don't forget that [Carrion Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) cannot block. He may be a giant threat, but he won't stop that [Raging Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Goblin) from smacking you. Make sure to include this in your calculations. [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) makes a much better replacement – but hey, this is a budget article.
* There are a couple of [Fabricate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate)s in the deck to help you find your combo pieces – much of the time it is right to go for [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp).

### Adding Money to the Deck

[Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) and [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) are the key. Can you imagine that when Darksteel came out I didn't think there would be any ‘money rares'? Boy was I ever wrong. [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) is strictly better than the Feeder in this deck, because it can get through much more via modular counters. Those modular counters would be great on an evasion creature like the Nexus, but truth be told, the Nexus can actually pump itself infinite times already if you have 2 Scorpions and it is already animated. Those are the only 2 big additions I would strive for in this deck – everything else is just icing on the cake. 

This deck is probably most fun in multiplayer, so having a few more cool creatures to [Fabricate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate) for that will gain you allies in multiplayer games would probably be helpful. You generally will not be seen as a threat, and you can help other players out by untapping their goods with [Dross Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Scorpion).

Until next time, [Pit Scorpion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Pit%2BScorpion)…10 times.
