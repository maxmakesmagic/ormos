*Guilds of Ravnica* came with rotation for Standard, shifting all eyes forward into the multicolor world of guilds—and the power of the gold cards that come with it. With big *Magic Online*, Grand Prix, and other premier competitive events yielding a new winning deck each week, players had their hands full picking a deck for Atlanta.


Here's where they ended up.

The greatest number of players opted for Golgari Midrange, followed closely by a range of aggressive strategies.


* **Golgari Midrange picked up 22% of the entire field.** [Find // Finality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Find+%2F%2F+Finality) works with the value creatures—[Ravenous Chupacabra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Chupacabra), [Jadelight Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jadelight+Ranger), or a similar spell-on-a-stick—and supports the creature-heavy plan [Vivien Reid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivien+Reid) works with. [Carnage Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnage+Tyrant) is challenging for control decks to wrestle with, while [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) gets bigger creatures online in time against aggressive deck.
* **Aggressive decks were split between white-based decks splashing red and mono-red decks.** White-Red Aggro is the familiar [Dauntless Bodyguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Bodyguard), [Legion's Landing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legion%27s+Landing), [Adanto Vanguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adanto+Vanguard), and [History of Benalia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=History+of+Benalia) curve, but layers in [Heroic Reinforcements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroic+Reinforcements); [Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurelia%2C+Exemplar+of+Justice); and perhaps a dash of [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) or [Justice Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Justice+Strike). Shoring up the classic mono-white aggro strategies with powerful red works. On the flip side, [Runaway Steam-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runaway+Steam-Kin), [Goblin Chainwhirler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chainwhirler), [Ghitu Lavarunner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghitu+Lavarunner), and [Wizard's Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard%27s+Lightning) can similarly race to victory against a range of decks. The key difference is mono-red is all-in on speed while red-white can push a little bigger off Aurelia and [Heroic Intervention](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroic+Intervention).
* **Izzet Drakes is flying high.** While there is more variety in the construction, every Drakes deck packs [Crackling Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Drake) (and almost certainly [Enigma Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enigma+Drake)) and [Arclight Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arclight+Phoenix) to maximize the power of speedy, cheap spells like [Opt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opt), [Chart a Course](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chart+a+Course), and [Warlord's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warlord%27s+Fury). Low-cost spells that find more spells put a ton of pressure on opponents to answer every flying threat.

Although the top four decks represent two thirds of the field, they were far from the only options for the weekend.


* **Jeskai Control was the most popular flavor of control decks.** While most builds opted for a variety of different counterspells, removal, and board sweepers, all the decks were built with a core of [Teferi, Hero of Dominaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Hero+of+Dominaria); [Deafening Clarion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deafening+Clarion); [Settle the Wreckage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Settle+the+Wreckage); and [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate). The choice between stopping relevant threats with [Ionize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ionize) or going big with [Expansion // Explosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expansion+%2F%2F+Explosion) ensures no two decks are exactly the same, but the plan to mop the field and stick Teferi is always there.
* **Boros Aggro is another aggressive flavor, this one focused on the ideal Boros curve of mentor cards.** [Boros Challenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Challenger), [Legion Warboss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legion+Warboss), and [Tajic, Legion's Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tajic%2C+Legion%27s+Edge) are more challenging to cast than either curve in the more popular white- or red-based aggro decks, but the payoff of an army far larger than anything opponents play early can be worth it. Of course, access to [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) and other cards shared with other aggro decks rounds out a similar consistent package.
* **Jeskai Midrange also showed up, albeit in far lower numbers than its control cousin.** While [Teferi, Hero of Dominaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Hero+of+Dominaria) is still in the plan, a pile of creatures instead of control spells back up everyone's favorite white-blue planeswalker. [Lyra Dawnbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lyra+Dawnbringer), [Rekindling Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rekindling+Phoenix), and [Tocatli Honor Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tocatli+Honor+Guard) are all solid to overwhelm opponents. Then, depending on the removal cards of choice to back them up, they might be enough to get the job done without Teferi stealing the show.
* **Boros Angels had a moment in the spotlight during Grand Prix New Jersey, and it shines here too.** Packed with amazing Angels—from [Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurelia%2C+Exemplar+of+Justice) to [Resplendent Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Resplendent+Angel) and [Lyra Dawnbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lyra+Dawnbringer)—and powerful cards like [History of Benalia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=History+of+Benalia), Boros Angels can race past opponents stuck on the ground.
* **Mono-Blue Tempo made a small splash, showing that speedy aggression isn't limited to red and white options.** [Siren Stormtamer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren+Stormtamer) and [Mist-Cloaked Herald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist-Cloaked+Herald) dodge right by most blockers other decks offer, and [Curious Obsession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curious+Obsession), [Dive Down](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Down), and [Wizard's Retort](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard%27s+Retort) as backup to refuel and protect attacking creatures lets this deck win before opponents can stabilize.
* **Selesnya Tokens takes a page from recent events too, and plays cards found nowhere else.** Many of the white- and red- decks share a few powerful cards, even across aggressive, midrange and control strategies, Selesnya Tokens is almost all its own. [Emmara, Soul of the Accord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emmara%2C+Soul+of+the+Accord) starts creating creatures early alongside [Thorn Lieutenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thorn+Lieutenant) and [Saproling Migration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saproling+Migration), then [Trostani Discordant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trostani+Discordant) and [Shalai, Voice of Plenty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shalai%2C+Voice+of+Plenty) arrive later to shore up the wide army. Of course, Selesnya still taps into some powerful cards other decks use too—[Legion's Landing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legion%27s+Landing) and [History of Benalia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=History+of+Benalia) are just too good to ignore.

Beyond these 10 decks lay many more surprising options to round out the remaining 10% of the metagame


* **Turbo Fog is still around**. [Nexus of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nexus+of+Fate) and [Root Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Root+Snare) are still fiends thanks to the power of [Teferi, Hero of Dominaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Hero+of+Dominaria) to loop forever.
* **Esper Control and Dimir Control offer different takes on control strategies.** Focusing on powerful black cards like [Vraska's Contempt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska%27s+Contempt) or adding the threat of [Nicol Bolas, the Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+the+Ravager) gives these decks plans others may not be prepared for.
* **Selesnya Midrange mixes tokens, Tyrants, and Angels together.** As in a typical tokens deck, you'll find [March of the Multitudes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Multitudes) and similar token-friendly cards—but this deck also piles in things like [Lyra Dawnbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lyra+Dawnbringer), [Carnage Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnage+Tyrant), [Vivien Reid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivien+Reid), and other mid-size creature power.
* **White Weenie is the classic white aggro trope.** For more consistency than Red-White Aggro, cutting the red altogether makes a lean mana base that's easy to rely on. It also means trading off the reach and Boros-themed options red provides, which is something most aggro players opted not to do this weekend.
* **Rainbow Lich is perhaps the strangest—and most fun—deck in the room.** [Lich's Mastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich%27s+Mastery) opens up whole avenues of gameplay, including taking advantage of [Chance for Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chance+for+Glory) to be more [Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) than game loss. Playing everything from [Gift of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Paradise) and [Search for Azcanta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Azcanta) to [Settle the Wreckage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Settle+the+Wreckage) and [Discovery // Dispersal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Discovery+%2F%2F+Dispersal) makes this deck both colorful and challenging to pilot. But when it fires on all cylinders, it's a sight to behold.

We'll check in against before Day Two kicks off tomorrow, but the field is full of decks that can close out a 5-0 Standard record for players today.
