If you had some way to interview your average shopkeep of Ravnica, you'd have your ear talked off with some outlandish tales. Many pieces of **Magic** flavor text take the form of quotes attributed to some of these everyday citizens. With some dedicated flavor-hunting you can string together quite a body of quotes from individual characters in the setting.

Or you can just read today's Arcana.

### Klattic

![Ghostway](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ghostway) Klattic is Boros legionnaire who was first quoted spouting some on inspirational words about the Legion on *Ravnica's* 
[Thundersong Trumpeter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundersong+Trumpeter). In *Guildpact* he speaks on facing that wall of innocent ghosts, [Souls of the Faultless](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Souls+of+the+Faultless), and describes the same hesitancy a player might feel about swinging into that soul-draining 0/4. Also in *Guildpact*, Klattic describes the sensation of being affected by a mid-combat [Ghostway](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostway), finally answering the question "Does it hurt to get removed from the game?" *“I watched its blade swing through me, but I was hollow, empty. I saw its face contort in rage but could not hear it snarl.”  
 —Klattic, Boros legionnaire*

  
### Ilromov

![Sanguine Praetor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sanguine+Praetor) Speaking up for the first time in *Guildpact*, Ilromov is a storyteller who brings tales from district to district as he travels throughout the city-covered plane. You've probably seen him comment on his experience of getting +1/+1 from a friendly [Ghost Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Warden), an event life-changing enough for him to revise his beliefs on the nature of fate. He philosophizes on the plight of [Starved Rusalka](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starved+Rusalka), a spirit who, like all the rusalkas, met her end tragically before her proper time. Ilromov waxes perhaps the most eloquent when describing his dire predictions for the world of Ravnica, as quoted on [Sanguine Praetor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanguine+Praetor). *“Our fealty to guilds dooms us. The old gods shall resurface. Our skins will wave upon the guild-masts over emptied streets, and our bones will clatter in the wind.”  
 —Ilromov, traveling storyteller*

  
### Otak

![Skarrgan Skybreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Skarrgan+Skybreaker) Otak, a shopkeep who plies his trade on Ravnica's famous Tin Street, joked about the accuracy of [Selesnya Sagittars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Sagittars). He also spoke his mind about the spooky [Ghosts of the Innocent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghosts+of+the+Innocent). Most recently, in *Guildpact*, he shouted this quotable about [Skarrgan Skybreaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skarrgan+Skybreaker), no doubt as he darted inside his shop. *“The sky isn’t falling—it’s being thrown at us!”  
 —Otak, Tin Street shopkeep*

  
Although legendary figures of the plane often take center stage (Agrus Kos, Razia and Teysa are quoted quite often), many, many minor characters also make up Ravnica's rough fabric. Have you noticed other recurring minor characters between *Ravnica* and *Guildpact*? Do you have a favorite voice from the world of Ravnica?
