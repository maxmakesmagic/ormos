MTG Arena Announcements, June 16, 2021

100-Card Historic Brawl and an Unbanning
========================================


On June 18, FNM at Home will feature a [100-card Historic Brawl event](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/strixhaven-historic-brawl-fest-comes-mtg-arena-2021-05-07)! Play for free to try it out.


Then, on June 19 starting at 8 a.m. PT, we'll launch a 100-card Historic Brawl event that runs through June 25.


Given Historic's larger card pool, we believe 100-card decks (including the commander) make sense for the Historic side of Brawl, but we wanted to see it in action before committing to a decision.


Historic Brawl fans, check it out and let us know what you think!


Entry for the Historic Brawl event following FNM at Home is 2,500 gold or 500 gems. You can earn these Japanese Mystical Archive card styles for wins:

Unbanned in Historic Brawl: Golos, Tireless Pilgrim and Winota, Joiner of Forces
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Since last August, we have been tracking and weighting specific commanders in both Brawl and Historic Brawl. Our goal has been to better match players with similarly weighted commanders, keeping the challenge for competitive players while ensuring the formats remain hospitable to casual players. Players with high-powered commanders are more likely to square off against each other, and casual players not looking for that high-powered experience are more likely to face similar opponents.


This has been largely successful. With this system in place, we are now more likely to use weighting rather than banning as a tool for managing very powerful commanders. Players who still really enjoy the experience of playing with those commanders may continue to do so, and players who don't want that high-powered experience can be free from it.


Therefore, [Golos, Tireless Pilgrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golos%2C+Tireless+Pilgrim) and [Winota, Joiner of Forces](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winota%2C+Joiner+of+Forces) are now no longer banned in Historic Brawl. As the format develops, we'll continue to adjust weighting of various commanders as appropriate.
