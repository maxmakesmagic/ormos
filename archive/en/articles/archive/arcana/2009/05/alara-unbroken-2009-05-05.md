It has come to our attention that *Alara Unbroken*, the new novel by Savor the Flavor writer Doug Beyer comes out today! It's the definitive tale of the world of Alara so you definitely want to check it out. Yes you do.



> *The plane of Alara split into five shards many centuries ago, each shard developing into a distinct world governed by its primary magical energy -- a sunlit kingdom, a hierarchy of artifice, a realm of the undead, a dragon-scoured hell, and a jungle paradise. Now, as the planes begin to realign and merge once more, an ancient evil seizes the opportunity to gain power from the chaos.*
> 
> 
> *As the shards of Alara erupt into war, the fierce leonin planeswalker Ajani Goldmane struggles to bring justice and resolution to his brother's death. Noble champions Rafiq of the Many and Elspeth Tirel search for the source of the chaos that has invaded their once ordered world. And Sarkhan Vol, planeswalker and dragon-shaman, discovers a primeval power that may be worthy of his reverence -- but deadly to Alara.*
