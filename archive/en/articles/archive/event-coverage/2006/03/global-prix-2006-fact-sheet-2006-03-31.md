The **Magic: The Gathering** Global Prix tournament is an international event featuring cash prizes and multiple invitations to various events.


### Format


* Deck lists are required

**Rounds**


* The number of Swiss rounds on day 1 is determined by the following formula applied to the chart below:  

 EFFECTIVE ATTENDANCE =  

 REGISTERED PLAYERS +(1-round byes x .56) + (2-round byes x 2.38)
 

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Effective
 Attendance** | **Number of
 Day 1 Swiss Rounds** |
| 1028 or less | 8 |
| 1029 or more | 9 |
* Day 2 will cut to a global Top 8, followed by the single-elimination finals to be played on Magic Online
* All Swiss rounds are 50 minutes in length; Top 8 single-elimination finals have no time limit
* When time is called, the active player will finish the turn and five additional turns will be taken

**Advancement**


* All players may participate in the Day 1 Swiss rounds
* If the number of *Registered Players*is less then 1028, the Top 250 players will advance from day 1 to day 2. If the number of *Registered Players* is 1029 or greater, the Top 500 players will advance from day 1 to day 2.
* The top 8 players after the final Swiss round will advance to the top 8 single-elimination finals.

**Communication**


* All verbal communication among team members is permitted. Written communication is not permitted.
* If necessary, one team member may draw a picture of a kitty, which the head judge will then show to the other team members, although this may only happen in Game 3 of odd-numbered rounds.
* Though players on a team may verbally communicate and gesture freely they must still complete game actions at a reasonable pace or they are engaging in slow play. The burden of reasonable pace is on the active player.
* Debate or discussion between players on the same team other than extremely brief consultation will be considered slow play.
* It is considered poor sportsmanship for a player to throw his or her voice in an attempt to fool the other team into thinking their cards are talking to them.

**Top 8**


* Time Travel Standard
* Upon making the Top 8, each player will be given a two-year stretch of cards from which to build their Standard deck.
* Top 8 matches will be best 2 of 3
* Players will be randomly assigned in the bracket.
* Paradoxes are strictly forbidden, per Time Corps Directive 56.0/J

**Notes**


* 40K, REL 4
* Players are responsible for knowing all DCI and [high-level tournament rules](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=protour/images/HighlevelRules.pdf). There will be a quiz after round 3.
* Players must bring pen, paper, card sleeves, snacks for the judges, and appropriate counters.
