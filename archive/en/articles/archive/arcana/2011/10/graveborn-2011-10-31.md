Happy Halloween! Unless you don't celebrate Halloween, in which case, no offense, you're missing out on a lot of fun dressing up and candy. Of course, it's possible that you're reading this on a day other than Halloween, but you could still put on a mask or something.


Anyway! In honor of the holiday on which you're *supposed* to read this, we've got a spooky picture of a sixty-card all-foil deck ... of the dead!
