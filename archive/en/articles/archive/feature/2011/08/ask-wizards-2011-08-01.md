Do you have questions about **Magic**? We here at Wizards want to answer them! Send us your questions about design, development, art, the website, and anything else about **Magic**, and if we get enough interesting ones, we'll post our answers in an upcoming feature article.

You can submit your questions [here](http://www.wizards.com/company/emailtoauthor.asp?author=Wizards%20of%20the%20Coast&headline=Ask%20Wizards), using the "Respond via Email" link below, or on our Twitter feed (@[dailymtg](http://twitter.com/#!/dailymtg)).

So what makes a good Ask Wizards question? Here are some guidelines:


> 
> * *Keep it civil*. While we take your negative feedback about the game as seriously as your positive feedback, it's hard to write a civil, satisfying answer to an uncivil question.
> * *Keep it short*. We generally quote questions in their entirety, so a ten-paragraph magnum opus is less likely to get an answer than a simple question.
> * *Keep it specific*. General questions about process and philosophy usually either have already been discussed on our website or are too big to be addressed in a few short paragraphs.
> 

Thanks, and we look forward to your questions!
