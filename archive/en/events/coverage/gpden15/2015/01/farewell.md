 "This is possibly the best Standard ever," were Pro Tour Hall of Fame member Paul Rietzl's first words on the subject of this tournament. He was standing with 2014 *Magic* World Championship Finalist (and also Hall of Famer) Pat Chapin, and Pro Tour *Magic 2015* Top 8 finisher Matt Sperling, as the three were solidifying their decklists for the Grand Prix. This deck finessing was nothing new for them. Rietzl even joked about a previous Grand Prix where he was building his deck in the middle of the floor in the tournament hall right before the start of the rounds.
