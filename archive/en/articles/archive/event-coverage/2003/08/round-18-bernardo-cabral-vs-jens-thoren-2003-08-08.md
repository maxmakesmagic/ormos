This match was for Top 16, and was a mirror match between two Goblin decks. Cabral's build contains maindeck [Pyrostatic Pillar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrostatic+Pillar)s and [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire)s, which should put him at a disadvantage for Game 1.

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a708.jpg)Cabral mulliganed down to six, and opened with [Goblin Lackey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Lackey), while Thoren had [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic). A Piledriver joined the Lackey on turn two, and Cabral opted not to attack and force a trade with the Fanatic. Thoren played a Piledriver of his own, and ended the turn. Cabral played his second Piledriver, and the game had become a rarity in a Goblin mirror match- neither player wanted to attack. This stalemate ended when Thoren cycled an Incinerator to kill a Piledriver, burned the other away with [Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire), and attacked with his team.

Cabral was left with just a [Goblin Lackey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Lackey), which blocked and traded with the Fanatic, leaving only a Piledriver on Thoren's side. Cabral rebuilt with a Fanatic, then played [Pyrostatic Pillar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrostatic+Pillar). Thoren attacked with just the Piledriver, played a Warchief, and said go. Cabral slowed things down with [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire), and was left with very few threats on the board and only one card in hand, while Thoren had plenty of resources to spare. The [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) didn't do much to prevent Thoren from developing his board, and the game ended a few turns later.

Cabral- 0 Thoren- 1

### Game 2

Cabral had no first turn play, and Thoren had a Lackey. Cabral's Piledriver would have provided a blocker, but Thoren removed it with [Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire), and his Lackey put a Piledriver into play. Before ending his turn, Thoren put a [Cursed Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll) into play as well. Cabral played nothing on his turn except for a second Port, while Thoren attacked and put another Lackey into play along with [Goblin Sledder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder).

Cabral drew and conceded, revealing a hand that contained lands, [Goblin Goon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Goon)s, and a [Siege-Gang Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander)- cards that were too slow for the mirror match, and Thoren's fast start.

**Final Result:** Cabral- 0 Thoren- 2
