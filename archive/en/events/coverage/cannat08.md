Canada National Championship 2008
---------------------------------


Pharmacy Student has the Prescription for Victory!
==================================================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/champ.jpg)Fighting his way through a field of emerging talent and longtime **Magic** greats, Toronto's own Andrew Ting-A-Kee took home the gold. His testing focused far more on constructed than limited, his decision to go with Blue-White-Red Blink paid dividends. He heads up a National Team that hails from all across the country, and this may prove to be the incentive that finally gets Ting-A-Kee onto **Magic** *Online*. Congratulations to Andrew Ting-A-Kee, 2007 Canadian National Chamion!
