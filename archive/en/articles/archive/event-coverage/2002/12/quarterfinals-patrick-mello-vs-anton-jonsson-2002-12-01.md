### Reckless ChargeGame 1

Patrick won the die roll which was already bad news for Anton, and Jonsson also had to mulligan. This match is very much in favor of the red deck, although if Anton gets a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) on turn three he might be able to win.

Patrick started with a [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup), which was [Reckless Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge)d on his second turn. He missed his land drop but also played a [Raging Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Goblin) on turn three, knocking Anton down to eleven. Jonsson couldn't find a turn three [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) so he went to eight and countered a Piledriver. A [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and a [Gush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gush) couldn't find a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) either, so they were very quickly onto the second game.

### Game 2

Once again the Swede had to take a mulligan, but unfortunately one mulligan wasn't enough this time. He had to go down to four cards and still didn't find a land. Patrick had won the game with [Raging Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Goblin), [Goblin Lackey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Lackey), and [Goblin Piledriver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver) before Anton laid a land.
