Players have any number of measures by which to judge their progress in the game, whether it be winning a foil at Friday Night Magic, finally reaching parity of 3-3 at a PTQ, or maybe getting all the way to the Big Show. Whatever their level, there’s always something to strive for. The same is true in the judge community. From the first time you pull on the famous black and white stripes, every event is a learning experience that brings new challenges, situations, rules interactions, and almost certainly tales of aching feet—judges walk a LOT!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/menery.jpg)*Sheldon Menery is one of only four Level 5 judges in the world.*One of the greatest strengths of the DCI Judge Program is the system that sees fellow judges nurturing talent from around the world, carefully shepherding them through the levels in the community. When a respected judge reaches the pinnacle of the game, it’s a cause for celebration, and rarely has it been more deserved than when Italian Judge Riccardo Tessitori took the final step up from Level 4 to Level 5. I spoke with fellow Level 5 Sheldon Menery, a fixture on the Pro Tour scene, most recently as Head Judge for Pro Tour Berlin. I began by asking him just how rare this promotion is....


“There are only four Level 5s in the world right now,” said Sheldon. “There’s Toby Elliott, Jaap Brouwer from the Netherlands, myself, and now Riccardo. It doesn’t happen every day, that’s for sure.”


The path towards the summit comes in two broad bursts. Former U.S. Air Force man Menery brings us this military analogy:


“Level 1s are the footsoldiers of the DCI. They’re there making all the decisions that make all the difference to the smooth running of thousands of events all over the world. Level 2s are the NCOs. Typically, they’ll be Head Judging events like Prereleases, and PTQs at a local or regional level. Once you hit Level 3, you’re kind of the Junior Officers. The focus between 2 and 3 shifts from an event focus to a community focus, since Level 3s are mostly responsible for a large region within their own country. In many ways, Level 3s are the most important, because they represent the pinnacle of the community, and a good Level 3 can grow a successful player base. Level 4s are your Colonels, typically Head Judging massive events like Grand Prix, and then Level 5s are your Generals, who mostly Head Judge Pro Tours and Worlds.”


So is Level 3 as far as most Judges get?


“It’s certainly the end of one journey, and the start of the next towards Level 5 is another long path,” allows Sheldon. “Level 5s lead the global Judge Program. We formulate and develop policy, we’re responsible for all training and resources globally. We’re definitely the Senior Management.”


As the Levels progress, the emphasis changes, with an ever-widening perspective on the global community. That can be a long, arduous journey from first finding out about the stack. So what is it that made Riccardo such a natural choice to join this most exclusive group? Sheldon is quick to respond:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/tessitori.jpg)*Newly minted Level 5 judge Riccardo Tessitori*”Leadership. Riccardo has taken on the Italian **Magic** community—not just the judge community, but the player base as well—and has turned that country into a model of how to turn a disparate community into one where everyone is supportive of one another, climbing towards a common goal, and you only need to see the rapid emergence of Italian **Magic** as a global force to see the fruits of his labors.”


There’s no doubt that adding Riccardo to the ultimate heights within the DCI will be good for the game.


“From Level 4 we’re already asking Judges for their opinions on the direction of the game from a judging perspective, and Riccardo has consistently displayed the qualities that make him an outstanding candidate. Our job is to make the rules clear and concise, and provide the best experience for players at every level around the world. Riccardo makes that job easier.”


The path that began many years ago has come to fruition with Riccardo Tessitori, one of the nicest people in **Magic**, standing at the pinnacle of the community alongside his fellow Level 5s. Congratulations to him. The game is in good hands.


  


Saturday, December 13, 9:41 a.m. – Big Event Warriors

*by Bill Stark*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/Schroeder.jpg)*Iowan Josh Schroeder drove 600 miles to be here.*It’s common knowledge that big events like the World Championships are perfect for all **Magic** enthusiasts whether they’re coming to battle in the big event, or simply enjoy their favorite hobby in an exciting setting. Walking around the tournament hall, it’s easy to see why Pro Tours appeal to so much more than just competitive players. The Champions Challenge gives all takers the chance to battle famous **Magic** personalities, like creator Richard Garfield, absolutely free. Not far away, the artists who actually bring life to the cards being battled with chat and sign cards for fans. A sneak preview of the upcoming novel *Agents of Artifice* is on hand, as well as the opening ceremony and Hall of Fame presentation. And that’s before we even get to the massive amounts of **Magic** actually being played this weekend! The coverage team got the chance to speak to a few players enjoying themselves outside the main event to see what brought them to Worlds and how they were enjoying their experiences.


Dave Williamson and Josh Schroeder drove over seven hours and covered more than 600 miles to see their first World Championships. Hailing from Davenport, Iowa, the two started the trip with a bit of tenuous weather. “When we left there was two inches of snow on the ground,” Dave said. “Fortunately it cleared up right away.” When asked why they had decided to come to the big event, Williamson quickly spoke up: “For me it was the only class of tournament I haven’t been to. I’ve seen Pro Tours, Grand Prix, and Nationals, but never the World Championships.”


Josh, the quieter of the two, had a more practical addition to Dave’s explanation: “When we found out it was essentially in our backyard, we knew we had to go.”


So how had the two been keeping themselves occupied on the weekend? “I’ve been playing a lot of Alpha games with Richard Garfield and [R&D Head Designer Mark Rosewater] in the gunslinging area.” Dave excitedly described.


“We also took part in the Question Mark contest last night.” Schroeder added. The event, hosted by Mark Rosewater each year at Worlds, is always one of the most entertaining portions of the tournament. In addition to Question Mark, Josh had also played in a Two-Headed Giant tournament for an iPod with his girlfriend. “I was surprised to find out you could win prizes with just a .500 record!” he said.


This isn’t the first time the two have traveled to an event together along with a group of mutual friends. “We try to travel as much as possible. It’s a lot of fun,” Williamson said before adding, “I’m looking forward to going out in Memphis tonight!”


Dave even laid out the story of his highlight of the weekend so far. “Last night I played an epic game of Alpha decks [decks built entirely out of original Alpha cards and using original Alpha rules] against Richard Garfield. By the end, a small crowd had surrounded us and when the game ended, a German player asked me if I would autograph a card for him. Signing an autograph *and* playing Alpha decks? My weekend is complete!”


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/becker_urban.jpg)*Jon Becker, left, and Matt Urban are old hands on the Pro Tour scene (but don’t tell them we called them ‘old’).*Two other friends making the most out of their World Championships weekend are Philadelphia residents Jon Becker and Matt Urban. Becker, who has a good-natured reputation for being a bit of a curmudgeon, is a longtime player who has even done official event coverage. “I’ve played in one Worlds, done coverage on two, and attended two more.” Why does he keep coming back to the events? “Honestly, it’s the good times. I hadn’t been to an event in a while and I love drafting. I have so many friends attached to **Magic** and most of them come to Worlds.”


Matt Urban is a benefits administrator and echoed Jon’s sentiment. “I’m here to draft, play Elder Dragon Highlander, and trade!” Urban is no competitive slouch, having played ten Pro Tours, finishing as high as 6th. Even though he’s seen the very heights of Pro Tour success, Matt is just as content playing Public Events as throwing down for the championship title. He excitedly showed a number of the trades he had picked up over the weekend, including a collection of extended-art cards that dazzled the eye.


See the best in the world, enjoy the game however you love to enjoy it, and spend a fantastic weekend in an exciting locale. What more could you ask for?


  


Saturday, December 13, 10:41 a.m. – Team Ukraine vs. Team USA
-------------------------------------------------------------


*by Bill Stark*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/blog_flags2.jpg)Headed into the final day of Swiss team play, an interesting name stood atop the standings: Ukraine. Perhaps not the first team one thinks of when imagining **Magic** powerhouses—yet—the Ukrainians led the field after solid individual performances from team captain Yuri Babich and his teammates Igor Gurov and Dmitry Kholyavko. They had a big name to take down for their first match of Saturday play: the United States.


Igor Gurov, representing Standard and playing Faeries, was quickly down and out against American captain Mike Jacobs and his Black-White Tokens list. After a mulligan to five in the first game followed by a two-land mana-screwed hand in the second, the Ukrainians found themselves in a 0-1 hole. On the far side of the table, captain Yuri Babich hopped out to a one-game lead in Extended against Sam Black by using the burn from his Red Deck Wins list to contain Sam’s Elves. Unfortunately for him, the sideboarded games saw Sam coming prepared with a combination of [Burrenton Forge-Tender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Forge-Tender) and [Umezawa’s Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Umezawa%25E2%2580%2599s%2BJitte), spelling doom for Yuri’s red army.


The final match, between superstar Paul Cheon and Dmitry Kholyavko, saw a Legacy mirror with both players running Stifle ‘Naught (Stifle / [Phyrexian Dreadnaught](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnaught) combo). Their first game went long, with Paul taking the lead after sticking a [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance)/Top lock, and by the time Dmitry was sideboarding for the second game, his team had already lost. Still, being in first at the start of Day 2 was a pretty auspicious beginning for a potential new team powerhouse. The three, each at their first World Championships, were excited to see play on the Pro Tour.


“The U.S. is excellent,” said Dmitry. “We’re having a lot of fun. Even our hotel is fun!”


When asked how they had determined who would play which format, the team demurred to Igor who answered with a smile, “We just rolled dice!”


We’ll have to wait until the end of the day to see whether team Ukraine can keep their momentum going forward or whether the early loss to the Americans will spell an end to their run for the weekend.


  


Saturday, December 13, 12:21 p.m. – Preparing for Extended
----------------------------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon*

Standard is gone, except for the lucky few coming back for Super Sunday action. The only drafting going on is in the Public Events arena. The Legacy decks are being put away for another year. Now just Extended remains, with six individual rounds determining the lineup for the live webcast Sunday. I got a chance to talk with some of the best players as they completed their preparations.


Stuart Wright has a fantastic track record in Constructed at Worlds. Indeed, but for a critical loss in draft he might well have multiple Top 8s, rather than the Top 16s and 32s he’s actually managed. This time around he’s going with Zoo. Why? “I played the deck in Berlin to a 4-4 record. It’s solid against Elves, because it has cheap removal and pressure, plus I have a decent sideboard against them.” On 22 points, yet another decent run could see the currently 64th-placed Brit on the verge of Sunday action.


Hall of Famer Jelger Wiegersma hasn’t done much testing, but that’s what friends are for, and Jelger has plenty—he was the overwhelming player choice for the 2007 Magic Invitational. He’s playing Urzatron this time around, allowing him to run Chalice of the [Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void) and Engineered Explosives against the dominant deck from Pro Tour**–**Berlin. Sitting next to him, Belgian star Marijn Lybaert confesses to a few nerves coming into this third day of action.


“I haven’t done much testing since Berlin. I’m playing Blue-black Faeries, and I’ve tested enough to know that I beat Elves, but that’s about it,” said Lybaert.


It’s understandable that Lybaert would want to know rather more than this, given that he currently sits in sixth place in the individual competition.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/extended_wide.jpg)*Doise, Karsten, and Lybaert plotted long and hard about the shape of Extended.*
Perhaps his fellow Belgian Jan Doise can shed some light on the format. He’s practicing with Frank Karsten, a man who knows a thing or two about succeeding at Worlds, having finished in second in 2005 at Yokohama. The Dutchie sits in 17th place coming into Extended, and both are playing versions of the Elf deck that served them so well in Pro Tour**–**Berlin. Given all the supposed hate around for the pointy-eared ones, I wondered about this choice.


“The thing is, I believe experience with a deck is really important” says Frank, “especially a difficult Combo deck like Elves. There’s no way you play optimally when you first pick up the deck. Every match you play helps you towards an understanding of the subtle interactions that can make the difference in a tight match.”


They’ve made some changes to counteract the hate that they expect to see. “[Essence Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden) doesn’t really help you beat the hate, so we’ve found room for maindeck [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize).” They also have some interesting Sideboard tech, but that would be giving a bit too much away. Other players know where **magicthegathering.com** is too! Meanwhile, Karsten is curious to see whether this Extended format pans out much like Mirrodin.


“In that year, many players brought in a few hate cards and claimed that this gave them a positive matchup against Affinity,” he said. “Turned out they were wrong. Affinity was just too strong and too consistent, and blew their way through the hate.” No doubt Karsten and Doise will be hoping for the same to pan out here Saturday.


Prize for the best conversation of the weekend thus far, however, goes to the man who currently leads the Individual event, Ervin Tormos. They say that Knowledge is Power, but that isn’t always the case. Witness this conversation between Tormos and Pro Tour**–**San Diego Champion Jacob van Lunen that took place at about 10 p.m. last night...


ET: So Jake, what do you think I should play tomorrow?  

JvL: How about Faeries?  

ET: Faeries? Why would I play Faeries?  

JvL: Because it beats Elves.  

ET: Elves? ELVES? C’mon Jake, this is Extended, nobody plays Elves...


  


Saturday, December 13, 12:42 p.m. - Magic: The Gathering Worlds on Facebook

Saturday, December 13, 1:35 p.m.: Agents of Artifice
----------------------------------------------------


*by Bill Stark*

The World Championships are famous for offering **Magic** enthusiasts of all types something special and unique to enjoy, and this year in Memphis hasn’t disappointed. For the first time in recent memory, Wizards of the Coast has been handing out special advance reading copies of the upcoming Planeswalker novel “*Agents of Artifice*“ to lucky fans all weekend long. On top of that, the lucky recipients also get the opportunity to offer feedback on the book to Wizards. We spoke with Helene Bergeot, the senior marketing manager for Wizards of the Coast, about the unique promotion.


“*Agents of Artifice* is a different type of **Magic** novel,” Helene described. “It’s all about the storyline, especially in regards to planeswalkers.”


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/book.jpg)The novel itself is a fantastic-looking work (this lucky reporter managed to snag himself a copy for “press” purposes....) with a new interpretation of the iconic Jace Beleren by Aleksi Briclot, none other than the illustrator of the original, as its cover art. From the blurb on the back of the book: Planeswalker Jace Beleren, a powerful sorcerer whose rare telepathic ability opens doors many would prefer closed, is at a crossroads: the decisions he makes now will forever affect his path. What decisions will that entail, and who will he be joining him in making (or forcing) said decisions? Not having read the novel yet, your guess is as good as mine, but Liliana Vess and Tezzeret are just two names that have been floated as being involved.


As for getting advance looks at novels now and in the future, Helene mentioned that similar promotions can be expected at future World Championships, Pro Tours, and at large conventions like Comic Con. “There are also sample chapters in Fat Packs to allow players a chance to preview the novels early,” Bergeot said.


Wizards of the Coast has put a strong focus on its **Magic** novels lately, putting out an extra push to find the best authors to bring the stories of the Multiverse to life. With the advance reading copies, they’re reaching out to their very player base to hear directly from **Magic** fans what they enjoy most about the novels, and even to offer suggestions about the things they’d enjoy reading about in the future. How have the early reviews been so far this weekend? Said Helene, “I gave a copy to one excited fan yesterday. He came back this morning and said ‘I read it all last night and I have to say, I love it!’”


Will you? You’ll have to find out by checking out similar promotions at upcoming Pro Tours and conventions as well as scoping out the Fat Pack sample chapter. *Agents of Artifice* is written by Ari Marmell and will be released to the public on January 27.


  


Saturday, December 13, 3:28 p.m. – Costa Rica Sweeps the Teams
--------------------------------------------------------------


*by Marc Calderaro*

The team portion of the weekend’s events is always a blur—especially this year. Three different formats per table, unfettered communication among teammates, and all those really cool, distracting little flags. And after the fog of battle lifted, only one team remained undefeated: Costa Rica. Captain Carlos Pal, Arick Dickerman, and Fernando Solorzano rose to the challenge after a couple rough patches and took down country after country, round after round. After factoring in the individual points, they’re still a modest 14th overall, but they’ve got a plan. And these guys didn’t fly over 2000 miles for nothing. I caught up with them right after the first round of Extended and asked them about their team experience.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/costa_rica.jpg)*The Costa Rica National team, from left to right: Fernando Solorzano, Captain Carlos Pal, alternate Marin Donato Sandoval, and Arick Dickerman.*They practiced together for more than a month prepping for this event. Solorzano remarked how lucky they were to have such a small country, so it wasn’t hard to get together. Dickerman lives the farthest away of the four and he said it takes them 40 minutes to travel to where they tested. I can’t even get home from the city in 40 minutes; sometimes it pays to be compact.


Most of their sessions were devoted to Extended, settling on a solid Swans list from Sandoval. They quickly decided on a straightforward all-in Legacy deck, Two-Land Belcher, then each played their favorite Standard decks, and decided whoever had the best record would pilot that build. Solorzano and Dickerman had a rough day one with the underperforming Cruel Control, but Pal went a solid 4-2 with his Black-White [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) deck. So, with Pal piloting Standard black-white, Solorzano took the Extended Swans, and Dickerman took the most fun deck in the world, Belchin’ Round the World. (Note: I totally made up that name. Feel free to use it in the future.)


Their Swans deck performed beautifully, barely dropping a game, and since Dickerman was able to play and activate [Goblin Charbelcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher) turn one in 60% of his games, pretty much he just had to say, “[Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will)? No? Good game.” I asked if he had much experience with the deck, and he informed me that he’d never played a game of Legacy before going off turn one in Round 1—that, my friends, is a deck. Simply put, they were able to outplay their opponents and capitalize on some key mistakes, and when that didn’t work, they just killed them before they got an upkeep.


The entire Costa Rican team are extremely excited to be playing at Worlds, and no one more so than Dickerman. That’s mostly because he’s lucky he got here. A triple-layover flight, delays, and missed connections almost cost him his spot in Memphis (hint: don’t let your sister choose your flights for you). But Dickerman was lighthearted about the situation. Since Marin Donato Sandoval, their alternate, has been performing the best out of their whole team, Dickerman joked that the team probably wished he’d missed that last flight in Tampa.


Though they’re a bit back in the standings, a solid cleanup in Extended, their most tested format, might put them in the spotlight. Who knows? They might just do it. Everyone on their team agreed that their Swans list is a 6-0 deck, and after looking at their list and watching it play, I’m inclined to agree.


  


Saturday, December 13, 6:08 p.m. – Elvish Presley
-------------------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/elvis.jpg)Are You Lonesome Tonight? Well C’mon Everybody because As Long As I Have You, Baby I Don’t Care. The problem with a reputation for puns is that when this kind of assignment comes up, every finger points straight at you. Yes, it’s rubbish joke time here at Worlds, including every variation on an Elvish Presley joke [][Gatherer](http://beta.gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx) could provide. Suspicious Minds might believe I’m actually quite comfortable inflicting this kind of psychological damage. Frankly, I’m All Shook Up. Still, in case you came upon this festival of frivolity by accident, you have been warned. For those of you who thrive in the world of the pun like Josh Bennett, this is for you. Uh-huh.


We’re going to take a stroll through our hero’s life, so join us on our [Elvish Promenade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Promenade). Our story begins on the ranch, where he seemed destined to be an [Elvish Farmer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Farmer). He spent his days chasing off birds with a shotgun as an [Elvish Skysweeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Skysweeper) and rearranging trees, where he made a great [Elvish Branchbender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Branchbender). The [Elvish Harbinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Harbinger) turned out to be his manager, who was an [Elvish Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Scout) and [Elvish Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Hunter). Indeed, you could say he was an [Elvish Headhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Headhunter). He was certainly an [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary). He had our hero’s vocal cords tested by the Elvish Ranger.


Once on stage the [Elvish Piper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Piper) was the herald for the warm-up act, the [Elvish Bard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Bard), who whipped up much anticipation for the Goblin’ King. His food choices were the stuff of legend, though not of Legends, making him the Burger King. He did eat healthily occasionally, but mostly that was just an [Elvish Aberration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Aberration).


The [Elvish Pioneer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Pioneer) manager was a great [Elvish Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Champion) and also offered [Elvish Guidance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Guidance). This was good, because our hero was easily troubled, indeed something of an [Elvish Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior). You could always tell when something was wrong, as he would stop shaving, making him [Elves of Deep Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elves+of+Deep+Shadow). He used to get into fights as an [Elvish Scrapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Scrapper), and an [Elvish Herder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Herder) was brought in as bodyguard. His early fans, the [Elvish Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Vanguard), were vociferous, waiting for hours to be an [Elvish Lookout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Lookout) for a glimpse of their hero.


He was generally easy going, and you didn’t often see his [Elvish Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Fury), but sometimes he would just become an [Elvish Berserker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Berserker), going nuts. He met the [Elvish Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Spirit+Guide), who worked as the [Elvish Soultiller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Soultiller) to help him find peace.


Onstage, he was a real [Elvish Pathcutter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Pathcutter), breaking new ground. His famous dance moves played havoc with his feet, and weren’t good for the [Elvish Archers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archers). An [Elvish Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Healer) was brought in, and a dedicated masseuse hired to stem the arthritis in his fingers, which nearly forced him to leave the guitar behind to be an [Elvish Lyrist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Lyrist). The [Elvish Handservant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Handservant) prolonged his career, and when he died there was a fabulous speech given by the [Elvish Eulogist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Eulogist).


Nowadays there are many [Elvish Impersonators](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Impersonators), but curiously not at the [Elvish House Party](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+House+Party), where such activity is not allowed. Still, you can visit his impressive car collection, the [Drove of Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drove+of+Elves), although sadly he never made it to the world of **Magic**, where he would of course have been [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves).


Thank you very much.


  


Saturday, December 13, 7:35 p.m. – Oiso and Tsumura: Best Ever, or Just Best Looking?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Marc Calderaro*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/blog__oiso.jpg)*Masashi Oiso shuffles in style.* In Round 17, two Japanese titans of **Magic** clashed. Masashi Oiso and Kenji Tsumura faced off, their Faeries decks gleaming in light of Jund’s red pillars. This could’ve been a prelude to Sunday, with both players currently in the Top 16. When the pairings went up, there were rumblings of an unofficial “Best Japanese player ever” crown to go to the winner.


It might sound like hyperbole, but it’s really not. Together, these two have redefined Japanese **Magic**, as simple as that. In the shadow of Tsuyoshi Fujita, Japan’s first **Magic** superstar, these two have come to Memphis and proven, once again, the effect the Japanese have had and still have on the game.


Oiso stormed onto the Pro Tour with a Rookie of the Year title in 2002-2003. Since then he’s earned so many Pro Tour Top 8s it’s mind-boggling; it’s mind-Budde-ing (not quite, he still has a bit to go for that). With six Top 8 finishes, he’s the only Japanese player with more than Kenji Tsumura (and, tied with Kenji, Tomaharu Saito and Shuhei Nakamura). Now he’s captaining the Japanese National Team (currently in first in the standings), which is quite the déjà vu, considering how he was on the 2005 National team that went all the way at Worlds and helped his team take home the trophy. As he sat modestly, endless reviewing his hand, he seemed at home, adjusting in his seat, shifting a stylish scarf around his neck, looking through the hand of his skilled opponent, Kenji Tsumura.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/blog__kenji.jpg)*Kenji Tsumura senses the foul presence of the ninja.* Tsumura is a relative newcomer next to Oiso, but his ability to consistently finish near the top of every standing is an unbelievable accomplishment and has mystified just about everyone since he blasted onto the scene. Winning Player of the Year over Olivier Ruel in a triumphant coup at Worlds in 2005, Kenji brings his heart and his engaging personality to every game and every city. Who could forget those ridiculous hats he and Olivier wore to Pro Tour–Philadelphia? Just looking at his slightly pink, glittering dress shirt with a vest and tie, Kenji puts himself in the game, and every event is different with him around.


Staring at these two deceptively imposing figures, intently focusing on the task at hand, it was hard not to think back to everything they’d done for the game, and everyone they’d influenced, inspired and just generally affected over the last half a decade.


If it sounds like I’m gushing, it’s because I am. I’ve followed these two for a long time now, and they’re a large part of the reason I’m involved in the game the way I am today. Anyone can be good at something, but watching these two compete, in contention for yet another World championship in the name of Japan, it was something a bit different. These two might be the best Japanese players ever.
