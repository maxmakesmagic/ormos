**Gary Krakower vs Terry Tsang**



This is a very exciting match, bringing together the well-known PTNY 1999 Quarterfinalist Terry Tsang of Burnaby, BC and two-time Canadian National Champion Gary Krakower together in this battle to see who would end the day at 5-1, putting them in a very good position to make the top 8.



**Game 1:**



The first game saw Gary taking advantage of Terry's poor draw (Terry did not drop a creature until turn 4) by playing Ravenous Rats, Phyrexian Broodlings and the ever-amazing Phyrexian Reclamation. Tsang tried to make a comeback with Lava Axe and Thorn Elemental, but Krakower went all the way. 



Krakower - 1, Tsang - 0.



**Game 2:**



This game was over in a hurry, with Tsang taking an early offensive with the Pro-Black Darkwatch Elves. Following it up with Treefolk Seedlings, Goblin Patrol and Argothian Swine. Krakower, however, managed only to cast a single Scent of Nightshade in his first 5 turns. On turn 7, Tsang attacked and then cast Scent of Cinder, revealing 2 Flame Jets, and Krakower scooped his cards.



Krakower - 1, Tsang - 1.



**Game 3:**



This game had Krakower always one step behind Tsang. From the first turn when Terry played a Goblin Patrol, Gary was on the defensive. Krakower cast Chime of Night on the Patrol. Tsang was relentless, attacking every turn and gradually whittling away Krakowers life. On turn 4, Tsang cast a Goblin Raider, and Gary replied on his turn with an Attrition. During Tsang's next attack, Krakower cast Scent of Nightshade, killing both Tsang's creatures. This didn't stop Tsang as he brought out Darkwatch Elves and Argothian Swine. Krakower tried to put out a Pestilence and force the draw, but Tsang's creatures proved too fast.



Krakower - 1, Tsang - 2.
