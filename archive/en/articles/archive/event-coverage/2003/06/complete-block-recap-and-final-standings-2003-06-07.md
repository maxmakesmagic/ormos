 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






What a great format! Third sets are traditionally very powerful and *Onslaught* Block decks took full advantage. My favorite? A Bargain deck that used Words of Worship for life gain.

Trent Boneau clung onto second place after a 3-0 finish and took the format trophy home as well. He will have to compete in a one-on-one draft against Neil Reeves in the finals to determine the winner.

### Final Standings

Neil Reeves 12-3 - Mousetrap Champion  
 Trent Boneau 11-4 - Complete the Block Champion  
 Don Paul 10-5  
 Jeff Taylor 9-6  
 Dave Williams 9-6 - Your Own Set of Rules Champion  
 Aaron Rzepka 9-6 - MQ Draft Champion  
 Haibing Hu 9-6  
 Adam Bernstein 9-6  
 Sceadeau D’Tela 7-8  
 Bryan Lyons 7-8 - 4-Way Solomon Champion  
 Michael Musser 6-9  
 Jonathan Pechon 6-9  
 Jeff Zandi 5-10  
 Carl Lobato 5-10  
 Rob Lawing 4-11  
 Sterling Savage 2-13 - Horse’s Ass Winner

When the final format began both previous Horse’s Ass winners, Jeff Zandi and Rob Lawing, had a shot at wresting the ‘lead’ away from Sterling Savage but he secured the trophy with an 0-3 finish. Somehow there is not coverage of a single Jeff Zandi match despite both myself and Jeff being under the impression that I had done one. I had ample opportunity to talk to the Texas magic figurehead and gave him ample opportunity to talk about Texas Magic.

In keeping with the fun atmosphere, Tim Weissman and Don James awarded a number of other prizes for a variety of things that they wanted to commemorate.

**Winning with the Worst Deck**: Jeff Taylor

**Losing with Best Deck**: Dave Williams—his 0-3 performance in the MQ was a shock to everyone.

**Losing with Worst Deck**: Bryan Lyons—starting at 1 life he did not win a game during Your Own Set of Rules

**Most Enthusiastic Player**: Jeff Zandi—made shirts and buttons for players and staff.

**Highest MQ test scores**: Bryan Lyons and Trent Boneau

**Lowest MQ test scores**: The Governor—this prompted much teasing of the Louisiana investment broker. “Did you spell your name right?” “How many have invested money with the Governor? Time to sell!”

**Career Best Finish**: Rob Lawing—in other words, not last place!

**Biggest Beating**: The Governor—he had an undefeated record against players from above the 23rd Parallel.

**Most Sportsmanlike**: Michael Musser—largely on the shoulders of his most generous singles run to his house before day 2.

**Best play**: Carl Lobato—used Gilded Drake to take a Priest of Titania and used the elf to power up a game-winning Upheaval.

**Worst play**: Jeff Taylor—His Void for eight that allowed Trent to Living Death—as an Instant!--his Avatar of Woe AND the Verdant Force he had been holding.
