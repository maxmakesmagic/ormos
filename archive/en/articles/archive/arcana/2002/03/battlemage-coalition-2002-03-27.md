As Matt Cavotta referred to in his [interview](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/feature/28), each Battlemage from *Planeshift* contains two parts of the Coalition symbol in its artwork, corresponding to the two kicker colors each card has.

The five Battlemages are shown below (clockwise from top-left: [Thornscape Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Battlemage), [Sunscape Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Battlemage), [Stormscape Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormscape+Battlemage), [Nightscape Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Battlemage), and [Thunderscape Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderscape+Battlemage)) with the Coalition symbols highlighted. Check your other kicker cards for Coalition symbols, too!

Notice the "black" Coalition symbol on the [Thunderscape Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderscape+Battlemage)'s axe. Sure, it's black, but that's really the blue symbol. Sometimes the artists make small mistakes -- so small that no one catches them until the card is printed.
