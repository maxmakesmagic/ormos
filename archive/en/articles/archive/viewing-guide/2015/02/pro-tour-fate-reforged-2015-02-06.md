After the Pro Tour, [Vintage Super League](http://vintagesuperleague.com/) resumes after a one-week hiatus for the big event in Washington, DC, with Week #2 of this second season. The highlight match for this show will be Randy Buehler as he faces off against Eric Froehlich. Coming off of his first week with the very first [turn 1 kill in the league](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AlvMfksj9c&list=PLQQ8jPMFzt7mK5VpGKGjgjtc0XKjRFSVc&index=4)—kudos to [Tolarian Academy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Academy) and [Goblin Charbelcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher) for their performance 20 minutes into the video—will Buehler be able to improve on his performance or will Froehlich be the one to emerge with his undefeated record unscathed?
