Manuel Bucher vs. Bertrand Fagnoni
----------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpzur04/qf1_1.jpg)The lone [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) player against the lone Red-Blue player in the Top 8. In a sea of Green with the two Affinity playing against each other one of the Swiss players faces on a French.


### Game 1


Fagnoni took a mulligan. Bucher was the first to blink with a turn two [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying). On his fourth turn Manuel tried [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) but The French had [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend).


Fagnoni dug deep with Thirst of Knowledge discarding two [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt)s before playing [Darksteel Ingot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot). The Swiss used [Reap and Sow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) to blow up one of Fagnoni's lands when the French stumbled.


Bertrand still felt safe at four mana but Manuel Bucher launched another [Reap and Sow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow), this time with entwine. Next the little Swiss decided he might as well start attacking.


He played [Leonin Abunas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Abunas) and tried [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) again. Fagnoni had [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul). The [Stalking Stones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones) turned into a creature and the French played [Darksteel Pendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Pendant).


Manuel: "[Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) with entwine?"  

Bertrand: "Ok, you win."


Manuel 1-0 Bertrand.


### Game 2


They both kept their hands, although Bertrand seemed anything but happy. On his third turn he played [Darksteel Ingot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot), but he missed his fourth land drop. Bucher fished with a turn four [Leonin Abunas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Abunas) but the French had [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend).


[Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) brought Abunas back, while Fagnoni set up for the long game with [Darksteel Pendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Pendant). When he found his fourth land he played a backbreaker: [Acquire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acquire).


Bertrand dragged it along trying to figure out what his opponent had in hand by looking at the cards in his deck. He ended up taking a [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum). Bucher played his own Simulacrum.


They traded Thorens and Fagnoni played [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines). [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) gave Manuel his second [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost), before he played Abunas. With the second [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) online he tried [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver). Bertrand allowed it.


Then young Swiss tried to activate [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and Fagnoni pointed to his [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines). [Beacon of Destruction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Destruction) took [Leonin Abunas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Abunas) away and [Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) bounced the [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver).


The Witness chumped the Pendant, and Bucher used another Witness to fetch back Abunas. Again Fagnoni had the [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) to try to stop the White creature. But this time he only got a chance to scry, because Manuel Bucher had enough mana for the whole Top 8 at this point.


The Swiss tried the [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) again but this time the French had [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul). But when Manuel tried [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) there was no answer. Standing behind his indestructibule artifacts-turned-creatures Bertrand tried desperately to find a way to regain total control of the table.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpzur04/qf1_2.jpg)Accross the table Manuel Bucher was having the time of his life. Next he resolved [Plated Slagwurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Slagwurm). Now that's something a Blue-Red can't really do much about. Still the French hardly blinked.


Manuel got rid of the [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines) and Bertrand's defense plan fell like a house of... well, cards. A [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) with entwine convinced Bertrand Fagnoni he might as well concede before the White Keeper started recurring the [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver).


Final result:


Manuel 2-0 Bertrand.
