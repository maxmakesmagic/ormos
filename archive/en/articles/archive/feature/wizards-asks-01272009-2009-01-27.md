*What's the most ridiculous way you've won a game of **Magic**, or seen someone win one?*


![Kelly Digges](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** Years ago, some friends of mine were playing Fat Stack, a format in which all players share a library (split into lands and nonlands) and a graveyard, with a deck put together specifically for the purpose—sort of like a Cube Draft without the drafting.


Anyway, the game was pretty well advanced, and a [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) had just cleared off the board. One player played down a creature and, as the only one who had one, saw his chance to win the game: [Biorhythm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm).


![Biorhythm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Biorhythm)  
The response was swift: a [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) for his lone creature, meaning that [Biorhythm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm) was about to resolve on an empty board, drawing the game.


Everyone looked around. Was that ... it?


Then another one of my friends slammed down his trump card ... and spoke a sentence that I'd wager has never been warranted before or since:


![Needlebug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Needlebug)  
*"[Needlebug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needlebug) for the win!"*
