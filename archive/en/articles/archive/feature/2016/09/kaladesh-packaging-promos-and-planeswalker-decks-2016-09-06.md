We have a lot of packaging to show off today, so let's not waste time reading me write something I believe is halfway clever that most people will skip over to get to the real information.


You've already done that, haven't you?


Fine. We'll start with the normal set packaging, move on to the Prerelease Pack contents, and, finally, end with showing off the faces of the new Planeswalker Decks—including the planeswalker cards that will grace the front of those decks.


*Kaladesh* Packaging
====================


Let's start out by ooh-ing and ahh-ing at the booster display box. *Oooh! Ahhh!*


![Booster Box](https://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/49HYWTxb4a.png)


That, of course, is Saheeli Rai welcoming us to *Kaladesh*. How very welcoming!


She's equally as welcoming on the front of the Deck Builder's Toolkit, the Gift Box, and the Booster Battle Pack!

Inside those boxes, you'll find packs that look a little like these:


![boosters](https://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/xFhnytv9mc.png)


Oooh! I recognized Saheeli again! And that's Dovin Baan! And that fiery-looking woman is clearly Chandra. But who are our other friends?


You can grab these when *Kaladesh* releases September 30.


Prerelease Packs
================


But what if you want to look at things you can get sooner? How about the Prerelease Pack?


![prereleasepack](https://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/RE2lE7lWJT.png)


Like any good invention, there's more in this one than meets the eye. First, in addition to the normal spindown die and stamped premium foil promo card you receive in most Prerelease Packs, you'll also receive a little make-your-own-thopter insert.

Plus, there's a little secret (well, not anymore) addition where a portion of the box can be removed and used as adorable dice storage.

Oh, and I suppose you'll also receive six packs of *Kaladesh*. If that's important to you.


Planeswalker Decks
==================


Finally, that brings us to Planeswalker Decks, the newest addition to our product lineup. We'll be revealing the contents of the Planeswalker Decks in a week, but what we can show you is the packaging with the front-facing card—aka the titular Planeswalkers.

And, for a better look at the cards, here are the versions of Nissa and Chandra that will go with these Planeswalker Decks.

And that's it as far as packaging goes. It's all very pretty—and coming soon to a [store near you](http://locator.wizards.com/).


Promos
======


Finally, that brings us to our promo cards. You've already seen all of these in some form, so this is mostly to gather them in one place.


First up, the Buy-a-Box promo, which you can get if you buy a box at a [local game store](http://locator.wizards.com) (supply limited, check with your store first).

Next, on Launch Weekend, play in an event and you could pick up one of these:

Finally, participate in a [Game Day event](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/kaladesh-events), and you could get this Essence Extraction. Make the Top 8, and you get this lovely Cultivator of Blades:
