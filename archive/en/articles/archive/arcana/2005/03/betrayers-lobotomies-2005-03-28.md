![Splinter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Splinter)The cycle of "[Lobotomy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lobotomy)" cards -- [Scour](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scour), [Quash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quash), [Eradicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eradicate), [Sowing Salt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sowing+Salt), and [Splinter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) -- originally printed in *Urza's Destiny* were, as you know, reprinted in *Betrayers of Kamigawa*. They are old cards made new in today's metagame. Since they remove their targets from the game rather than just destroying them, they are effective against modern forms of recursion like [Rootrunner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Rootrunner), [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) and [Auriok Salvagers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Salvagers). And since they remove all copies of their target, they can shut down entire deck strategies, such as winning with [Kokusho](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho), [Goblin Charbelcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher) or the mana from [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost). 


They are also made fresh with amazing, abstract, Kamigawa-appropriate art. Check out some high-res art from these cool reprints along with their art descriptions. Note how the art descriptions are similar, yet each artist took the piece in a creative, new direction.


### Scour


[Scour](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Scour)  
*Art description: This spell not only destroys an enchantment spell, but every memory of the spell, too. An abstract representation of this is probably best. For example, show an unnaturally vibrant meadow, rich colors, sunlight streaming in, but then small squares of the 'canvas' are peeling and blowing away, revealing a dull yellow-brown meadow beneath. (Think of some of Magritte's paintings, for example.)* 



### Quash


[Quash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Quash)  
*Art description: This spell not only destroys an sorcery/instant spell, but every memory of the spell, too. An abstract representation of this is probably best. For example, show a ray of spell energy (fire, bright light, spiraling dark energy, your choice) heading toward a wizard, but then the ray is dissipating into two-dimensional shapes of birds or something, which are blowing away. (Think of some of Escher's paintings, for example.)*



### Eradicate


[Eradicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Eradicate)  
*Art description: This spell not only destroys a creature, but every memory of it, too. An abstract representation of this is probably best. For example, show a samurai in light-colored robes and/or armor. As (s)he drops his/her sword, some portion of his/her body is breaking into small two-dimensional shapes of some kind. (S)he's being erased from reality.*



### Sowing Salt


[Sowing Salt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sowing%2BSalt)  
*Art description: This spell not only destroys a place, but every memory of the place, too. An abstract representation of this is probably best. For example, show a leveled village in the mountains. An akki goblin is walking away from the viewer, and a trail of rock salt spills from a hole in the sack he carries over his shoulder. The salt gets thicker and thicker toward one corner of the frame, until at the very corner it's just solid white, as though the canvas is blank. (Think of some of Magritte's paintings, for example.)* 



### Splinter


[Splinter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Splinter)  
 *Art description: This spell not only destroys an artifact, but every memory of the artifact, too. An abstract representation of this is probably best. For example, show a suit of lacquered-black samurai armor on a primitive wooden stand. As the wind blows from one side, the armor begins to peel away in two-dimensional leaf shapes, as though it were an illusion (Think of some of Escher's paintings, for example.)*
