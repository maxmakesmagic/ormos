While **magicthegathering.com** looks forward to *Fifth Dawn* for the next three weeks leading up to the [prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/prereleases), today at Magic Arcana we're taking a bit of a look back. 

This week's Art Close-Up Quiz may take a bit more research than [#1](/en/articles/archive/art-close-quiz-2-2004-04-21) or [#2](/en/articles/archive/art-close-quiz-1-2004-04-12): the cards pictured in ultra-close zoom below are *not* restricted just to the recent *Mirrodin* block. 

Can you identify the card to which each belongs? Be sure to hit the message boards discussion link near the bottom of the page to compare notes with your fellow **magicthegathering.com** readers.
