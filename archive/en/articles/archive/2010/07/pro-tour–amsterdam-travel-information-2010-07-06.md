When it comes to arranging accommodation and travel, the smart solution is to turn to the experts. Amsterdam RAI Hotel & Travel Service has enormous experience and can offer you considerable savings in money, time and hassle.


It couldn't be easier. Our [online reservation system](https://www.rai-hotelservice.com/compass/external/index.cfm?meeting_ID=1401&Meeting_ID_Code=615110067) allows you to search for hotels by star rating and area. Additionally you can view a map showing the location of the hotel in relation to Amsterdam Factory and find detailed information about each hotel. For group bookings and tailor-made advice contact us via email at [hotelservice@rai.nl](mailto:hotelservice@rai.nl).


Discounted room rates at the official hotels are limited so don't delay as the demand for rooms is high during Pro Tour–Amsterdam.
