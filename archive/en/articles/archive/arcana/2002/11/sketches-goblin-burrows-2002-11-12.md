This week's "Sketches" looks at one of the tribal nonbasic lands in *Onslaught*, [Goblin Burrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Burrows) by David Martin.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:


"Location: Skirk Ridge. Notes: Basic Land. These are the mountains where the Goblins live."

Yes, that says "basic land." This particular piece of art was originally commissioned for a basic Mountain.

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by David. The attention to detail regarding the caves where the Goblins live made the art feel like something more than just a basic Mountain, and it was moved to [Goblin Burrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Burrows).

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. The Goblins carrying the dead Beast were removed to keep the focus of the piece on the land itself.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as it appears in the set.
