This past weekend, we debuted the *Khans of Tarkir* teaser trailer to an eager audience at San Diego Comic-Con. Today, we debut it to the world.


We'll be putting up a video of the rest of the *Magic: The Gathering* panel later. In the meantime, enjoy this glimpse into the world of Tarkir and start counting down the days until the first preview week, which begins September 1, 2014.
