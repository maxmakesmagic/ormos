Build Notes
-----------


Standard | [Demanding Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demanding+Dragon) now correctly allows a player to take damage instead of sacrificing a creature.


General | Snow mana now appears separate from other mana in the mana pool.


General | Triggers from [Aether Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=438778), [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor), and the mentor ability will no longer be automatically placed on the stack to allow more precise control.


The following issues were implemented last Wednesday:


Modern, Cube | [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet) will no longer cause the game to restart.


Commander, Legacy | [Grindstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grindstone) and [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage) will no longer cause the game to restart.


Collection | You are now able to immediately update an imported deck with versions of cards from your collection.
