Today's Must
============


1. Prepping Standard Ahead of the Grand Prix | By a bunch of people

[Grand Prix Houston](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gphou16) is this weekend, and with it we get one of our last looks at high-level Standard ahead of the rotation ([Grand Prix Paris](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gppar16) is the actual last look), and content producers have picked up that thread and run with it in a few places.


* "[A Combo Deck That Can Grind](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/emmahandy-022516-a-combo-deck-that-can-grind/)" by Emma Handy—The defacto best deck and the one everyone will be gunning for is [Rally the Ancestors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors), so why not start with a primer there?
* "[Beat Back Rally in Houston](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/beat-back-rally-in-houston/)" by Josh Silvestri—Or maybe you want to beat Rally? Josh has some answers in the form of several pretty powerful deck lists.
* "[Jeskai Rider (Video)](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13141&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=2-25-2016)" by Seth Manfield—Our reigning World Champion thinks that Mantis Ridering all over Standard might be the answer.
* "[A Metagame in Motion](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13140&writer=Adam+Yurchick&articledate=2-25-2016)" by Adam Yurchick—Finally, for a more birds-eye view, Adam Yurchick looks at the ins and outs of the metagame to better help you predict the field at Houston.

And, of course, if you're not going to Houston, all of this advice is perfectly useful at FNM or while watching live coverage on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic).


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Against the Odds:](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-inverter-of-truth) [Inverter of Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inverter+of+Truth) | MTGGoldfish | Saffron Olive

[Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) is a pretty powerful sideboard card in Modern—but what about making it work for you in the main deck? [Inverter of Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inverter+of+Truth) might be the headline grabber in this video, but Saffron has cobbled together a deck that tries to cheat when it comes to playing other monstrosities as well—[Eater of Days](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eater+of+Days), [Hunted Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Horror), and [Dust Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Elemental). The results are—surprising.


1. [MTG—Build a Modern White Splash Merfolk Deck for *Magic: The Gathering*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1_Nbwfx8I) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

Are Merfolk the answer to the Eldrazi menace in Modern? There's been some talk that they might be, and they've seen some measure of success, so The Professor explores our fishy friends with some very soothing music in the background.

The Magic Mics group goes a little deep on *Conspiracy* theories in last night's episode.


Or do they?

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [#NotAllManLands](http://www.mtgdiversity.org/notallmanlands/) | Planeswalkers for Diversity | Andrew Rudiger

Over the last few days, there's been an at times quiet discussion on Twitter and in forums about the terms "manland," "creature land," and variations thereof that refer to lands that can become creatures. That talk then turned into the article [#NotAllManLands](http://www.mtgdiversity.org/notallmanlands/) on Planeswalkers for Diversity, which does an excellent job of recapping the discussion and the points on all sides.


The community has shown that it will name things what it names things, often despite our insistence otherwise (*ahem* "Robots"), but this is one area where we will be sticking with our style guide and using the term "creature lands."


Recently Wizards of the Coast redid our core mission statements for the company. At the very top of the list of our values is "Inclusivity," and here's what it reads under that heading:


"We value all people and perspectives inside our walls, among our players, and in our games. Dragons and elves belong in our worlds, and so do you."


"You" means everyone. And for that reason, we will use the most inclusive language we can. "Manlands," while it has a history and a catchy near-rhyme, does not meet that standard. Therefore, DailyMTG and all parts of our website do currently and will continue to use "creature lands" (in English) as the primary way to describe land that turn into creatures.


Except for [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus). That one we call "Inky."


(Oh, and [I'll also accept "lanimals,"](https://twitter.com/DreamtimeDrinne/status/702695026774712320) because that's adorable.)

What now?! What in the world is [happening in Paliano](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic/status/702885768944029696)?


This is driving me a little nuts. Do I have to update [the announcement again](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-conspiracy-2)? I'm not sure what to do about this, but you should probably check back tomorrow. I'm sure [DailyMTG](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/articles) will have some news then.

1. [*Magic Online* Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg97ZLTScSyUeh1nvInuB2X3Y2eDHz6fe) | MTGHeadquarters

Jeremy of MTGHeadquarters wants to teach you all about *Magic Online* with a series of videos on a [growing playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg97ZLTScSyUeh1nvInuB2X3Y2eDHz6fe). There are four videos now but, I imagine, more on the way. The playlist is a touch out of order, but I'd recommend with starting on video No. 2 in the playlist (as of this writing) titled "How To Play *Magic: The Gathering* Online–MTGHeadQuarters." You can view it below.


For more resources on *Magic Online*, especially for newer players, you can also check out our [*Magic Online* resources page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/en/gameinfo/products/magiconline/resources).

Shaun Penrod hosts this podcast series that features a new guest every episode imparting some sort of wisdom on the listener. Each podcast comes with an article as well and some *Magic*al details about the episode's guest. [The latest episode](http://www.mtgprotutor.com/jimdavis/) (No. 72, so you know the podcast has been around) features Jim Davis, winner of the StarCityGames.com Players Championship in 2015.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Dragonlord's Servant](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/rptq-top-8-decklists/shadows-over-innistrad-rptq-decklists-plano-2016-02-21)

[Dragonlord's Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord%27s+Servant) wasn't really printed to be a Constructed powerhouse. It was a cute (adorable really) addition to players' Dragon tribal decks, a body in Limited, and an amusing Goblin to open now and then.


And now it's a four-of in a 4th-place RPTQ deck.


Sure, 4th isn't 1st, but Plano was a 70-person tournament featuring PPTQ winners from potentially all over the Southwest, and its pilot, Orrin Swift (an occasional Pro Tour competitor), is no slouch.


Orrin went a bit deep on Dragons this time around, playing Black-Red Dragons, but buttressing his air forces with [Boltwing Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boltwing+Marauder) on top of mainstays [Thunderbreak Regent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) and [Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%27s+Fury). Boltwing Marauder—yes, Intro Pack Boltwing Marauder—is the interesting addition, as Black-Red Dragons has moved toward a Thopter sub-theme to better take advantage of Kolaghan, making Marauder trigger upwards of three times in a turn. That's enough to turn any creature into a dangerous threat.


Including, yes, [Dragonlord's Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord%27s+Servant).
