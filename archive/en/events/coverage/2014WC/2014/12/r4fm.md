Just about every player among the twenty-four in attendance this weekend is on some kind of track that could result—or already has resulted in—a Hall of Fame berth. You have to be that good to even get here, so it's rarely a stretch to imagine a possible future where any of the non-inducted players earns their lifetime invite.



 Seventh-ranked William Jensen is already there, but it's not difficult to picture his Round 4 opponent and fourth-ranked player in the world Shaun McLaren ([read his full profile here](/node/296841)) one day joining him. McLaren has been on a tear like almost no other since winning Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*, where he proved himself a master of both Modern and the Jeskai clan. He's also a member of the Canadian national team this year, and results in one or both tournaments could go a long way toward catapulting him into a Hall of Fame-level stratosphere.




 If anyone can claim a more impressive year than McLaren, Hall of Famer Jensen is certainly on the short list. His eight Grand Prix Top 8s last season set a record, and his invite to this tournament capped his return to the game started several years ago. ([Read his full profile here.](/node/309621))



The Decks
=========



 So far this weekend, Jensen is storming in all formats, building a Storm list in *Vintage Masters* draft and following it up with Modern Storm/[Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), an often forgotten combo deck in a post-[Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) world.




 McLaren meanwhile was playing—hold on, I'll give you one guess. Exactly one. Go ahead and Google McLaren. Or check out his win at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* or his second place finish at Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*. One guess, that's all you get.



Did you say Jeskai? Good job! You win!




*While Hall of Famer William Jensen went with the oft-forgotten [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) deck, McLaren went with his standard go-to: Jeskai.*
