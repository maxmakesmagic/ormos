Blue has a theme of shapeshifting in *Planar Chaos*, as you can see from cards like [Erratic Mutation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Mutation), [Aquamorph Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity), and Pongify. Another example is [Shaper Parasite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite). Although it’s actually an Illusion, its power/toughness-modifying abilities are often used to “shapeshift” a creature right into the graveyard.

 Like many blue morph creatures, the art of [Shaper Parasite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite) depicts a bizarre creature bursting from its spiderlike [morph shell](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/1191). You may not have noticed, however, that the body of [Shaper Parasite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite) is actually *composed* of morph crawler legs. Near its head, the legs become clawlike appendages. Creepy!
