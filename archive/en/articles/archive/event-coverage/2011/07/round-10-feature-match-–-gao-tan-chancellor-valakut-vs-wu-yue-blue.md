### Game 1


Gao had to throw back his initial seven and agonized over his next six cards. He eventually decided to go down to five and keep whatever cards he had left. He started the game by revealing [Chancellor of the Tangle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor+of+the+Tangle) to his opponent but Wu wanted more information.


Wu opened with [Darkslick Shores](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Shores) and [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) to see [Joraga Treespeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joraga+Treespeaker), the mentioned Chancellor and three lands. When Gao tried to level up the Elf, Wu dispatched it with [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat).

[Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) netted Gao a [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and when he tried to resolve [Chancellor of the Tangle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor+of+the+Tangle), it was on the receiving end of [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Both players seemed to have no action whatsoever but the [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) was busy taking cheap shots at its master's enemy. Still refusing to crack his [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) (with two charge counters), Wu went down to 14 and tapped out for [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan).


Using this opportunity, Gao resolved [Avenger of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar) but had no land to go with his 7 Plant tokens. [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) sneaked in for six damage, upping the Zombie count to four. Failing to draw a land, he resolved [Chancellor of the [autocard]Tangle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor+of+the+%5Bautocard%5DTangle)[/autocard] this time but it was sent to the grave with Wu's second copy of [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat).


A topdeck from the Valakut player promised to change the game. [Green Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) allowed [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) to enter the battlefield, growing all his plant tokens into 2/3s, good enough to stave off six opposing 2/2 Zombies. While Wu might not lose in the red zone, it was inevitable that he would die to multiple Valakuts on the next turn.


Gao Tan fights back from five cards to take Game One.

### Game 2


Gao started by revealing [Chancellor of the Tangle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor+of+the+Tangle) to enable turn one [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) and when he tried to resolve [Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle) of Mul Daya, Wu was ready with [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) reloaded his hand and dug deeper into his deck with [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas).

Playing around additional [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s, Gao resolved [Green Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) to grab himself a deceivingly important [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) but it once again fell to [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat).


[Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) allowed both players to draw a card simultaneously but Wu had to be sure he didn't give any important spells to Gao. A [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) revealed THREE [Chancellor of the [autocard]Tangle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor+of+the+%5Bautocard%5DTangle)[/autocard]s, [Avenger of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar) and [Artisan of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artisan+of+Kozilek), prompting Wu to gasp. Wu had [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) for the plant generating monstrosity but could not stop [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) from searching up double [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle). A pair of [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge)s took them out, but Gao wasn't worried at all.


He untapped and summoned [Artisan of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artisan+of+Kozilek) to resurrect [Avenger of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar), then attacked with [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) tutoring up two more Valakuts. The rest is pretty much self-explanatory.


Gao Tan defeats Wu Yue to take the match.
