Fate Reforged contains a ton of Standard-worthy cards that can enhance existing decks, spawn novel archetypes, or provide sweet new options. During the byes, four-time Pro Tour Top 8 competitor Marijn Lybaert, one of this weekend’s commentators on the twitch.tv/magic live stream, went over the entire set and selected his Top 20 from Fate Reforged from Standard.

Here they are, along with explanations on what makes these cards stand out.




---

20. Warden of the First Tree
============================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree)


Often compared to [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny), [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree) is an aggressive creature that can single-handedly take over the late game. It sees some play Abzan Aggro, although not a lot because that deck often wants to play [Sandsteppe Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandsteppe+Citadel) on turn one. However, the good thing is that it’s not just an Abzan card; it can find a home in a Selesnya or Golgari deck as well!




---

19. Frost Walker
================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Frost+Walker)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Walker)


A 4/1 in blue for two mana is, with the exception of Dandan, not something we’ve seen before. As such, [Frost Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Walker) is already seeing some play in Temur, where it nicely enables ferocious for cards like [Stubborn Denial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stubborn+Denial). The downside is minimal because there are not many removal spells that wouldn’t kill it anyway--you don’t care if your opponent targets it with [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall).




---

18. Yasova Dragonclaw
=====================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Yasova+Dragonclaw)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yasova+Dragonclaw)


Her base stats are fine, and she only costs a single green, making her easier to cast than [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) in a three-color deck. But her key appeal is the ability to take control of a creature. This can swing around the game, especially if you manage to gain control of [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant). Although Yasova isn’t seeing a ton of play yet, she is included in various R/G aggro decks.




---

17. Flamewake Phoenix
=====================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Flamewake+Phoenix)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamewake+Phoenix)


Reminiscent of [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix), this 2/2 flyer puts a lot of pressure on opponents. It is good discard fodder for something like [Tormenting Voice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormenting+Voice); it is great to sacrifice to [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde); and it nicely synergizes with [Fanatic of Mogis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis). It requires a specific deck to take advantage of the ferocious ability, but the power is there.




---

16. Monastery Siege
===================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Monastery+Siege)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Siege)


This is one card that Marijn Lybaert believes we’ll see more of. Mostly used for the Khans ability, it is a nice setup card for a deck that revolves around big delve spells like [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise). It gets cards in the graveyard, gives card selection, and even adds to blue devotion if you’re interested in that.




---

15. Brutal Hordechief
=====================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Brutal+Hordechief)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Hordechief)


Marijn Lybaert’s favorite all-time card is [Hellrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellrider), and [Brutal Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Hordechief) is similar. When you play it on turn four when you already have three creatures in play, it essentially fires off a free [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) the turn it comes down. In the late game, the activated ability can dominate combat, too.




---

14. Silumgar, the Drifting Death
================================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death)


This dragon is a glorious piece of the blue-black control puzzle. It kills tokens, attacks planeswalkers, and has hexproof to boot. It also works well with [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate), turning the sorcery into a one-sided sweeper that leaves your dragon on the battlefield after the fateful dust clears.




---

13. Temur Sabertooth
====================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Temur+Sabertooth)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Sabertooth)


It’s a fine attacker, it can dodge removal when you have two mana up, and it can generate value by returning [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms). While it’s decent on its own, its main selling point is that it enables a great combo: if you have [Temur Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Ascendancy), [Temur Sabertooth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Sabertooth), [Voyaging Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr), and [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) with seven devotion to green in play, you can generate infinite mana.




---

12. Wild Slash
==============


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wild+Slash)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Slash)


You get what you pay for. It’s more or less [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock), which is an effect we were missing in Standard. We had [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) and [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), but we missed a good one-mana removal card that can take out [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) or [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way). [Wild Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Slash) kills a bunch of stuff at an efficient mana point, so it’s an important addition to the Standard format.




---

11. Soulfire Grand Master
=========================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soulfire+Grand+Master)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master)


As a 2/2 lifelink, it’s a serviceable two-drop, but nothing too special. What sets it apart are its additional abilities, in particular when combined with cheap burn cards like [Wild Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Slash), [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), and [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames). If you get to the late game and can turn [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) into a [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) with buyback, then that’s a great way to leverage a two-drop.




---

10. Whisperwood Elemental
=========================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Whisperwood+Elemental)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental)


[Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) is a very powerful creature. You don’t want your five-drop to just die to a spot removal spell, but this one will at least leave a manifested 2/2 behind, provided you play it when your opponent is tapped out. In addition to long-game inevitability through a steady stream of creatures, it also provides a decent answer to [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate) and [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities).




---

9. Torrent Elemental
====================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Torrent+Elemental)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+Elemental)


This one works very well together with all of the delve cards, including [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), and [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang). Moreover, as a 3/5, it has the perfect size for blocking [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) or [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider). And when you go on the offense, you can tap down any pesky blockers. But all thing considered, it’s the synergy with the delve cards that makes it stand out.




---

8. Outpost Siege
================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Outpost+Siege)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege)


Set to Khans, it’s like an unkillable [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster). Because your opponent cannot attack [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege), it sticks around and ensures a same steady stream of cards. Set to Dragons, you can shoot down your entire opponent’s board, especially in decks with [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) or [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster). There’s a good option for every game, and arguably it deserves to see more play.




---

7. Frontier Siege
=================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Frontier+Siege)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frontier+Siege)


While the synergy with [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) is nice, the main reason for playing this card comes from the Khans side. When you play it on turn four, you immediately get two mana that you can use in your second main phase. On turn five, you add a total of four mana. If you have plenty of big cards to play and some card draw spells to refuel, then it’s easy to overpower your opponent from then on.




---

6. Valorous Stance
==================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Valorous+Stance)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance)


The first mode is a nice counter to [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) or [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), and the second mode can deal with creatures like [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) or [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). Both modes are okay, but what makes this card so strong is the flexibility: You have a choice, increasing the likelihood that you’re ready with the right effect for any situation. Modal spells are always better than they look at first glance.




---

5. Crux of Fate
===============


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crux+of+Fate)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate)


Blue-black control was missing a sweeper. It had [Perilous Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Vault), but that was slow and cost too much mana. [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate) changes all that. It is an efficient way to clear the board and to allow the control deck to transition into the late game. Cruxially, because it forces a choice between Dragon and non-Dragon, the introduction of [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate) has fated an uptick in [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon).




---

4. Monastery Mentor
===================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Monastery+Mentor)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor)


It’s worse than [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) because three mana is much more than two mana, especially when there’s so much competition at the three-drop slots. After all, cards like [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) and [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) also vying for inclusion. Yet, [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor) is a very powerful card, and it’s up to the competitors here in Seville to find the right home for it.




---

3. Shaman of the Great Hunt
===========================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shaman+of+the+Great+Hunt)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+the+Great+Hunt)


It fits in Temur Midrange. It fits in R/G Aggro. It even fits in Jeskai Fireworks. So it can slot into a large number of decks, but it is best when combined with [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) and [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster). With those synergies, [Shaman of the Great Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+the+Great+Hunt) can do a lot of work to boost your team, and the card draw ability makes it a must-answer in the late game.




---

2. Ugin, the Spirit Dragon
==========================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon)


If you’re behind, it’ll allow you to catch up. If you’re ahead, Ugin will help seal the deal. Its mere existence makes control decks better because it goes over the top of everything else, and it is the ultimate trump card in Standard. Sure, eight mana is a lot, but it is achievable in the right deck. Cards like [Frontier Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frontier+Siege) and [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) help to ramp into it, for example.




---

1. Tasigur, the Golden Fang
===========================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang)


This card is bananas. It’s like a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) for one mana! Okay, it doesn’t drain, but you can’t expect everything when you’re only paying a single black. On top of that, the activated ability is awesome, effectively giving you an extra draw step in the late game. Last weekend, Tasigur has already shown its power in Modern. This weekend, he’s poised to confirm his power in Standard as well.
