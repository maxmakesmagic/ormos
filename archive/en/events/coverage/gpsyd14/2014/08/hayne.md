With the three byes under their belt, Jacob Wilson and Alexander Hayne opted for the sleep-in special today, allowing them to attempt to sneak in under the radar of coverage, but we managed to track them down anyway. The two are both avid limited players and constructed deck builders. Wilson is fresh off a second place at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* plus a GP win in 2012, and Hayne has an impressive track record of three GP wins and a Pro Tour win.


We asked the pair what they would be looking for in their sealed pool. Jacob admitted he had a strong preference for being in either mono-red or mono-white, but realised most pools wouldn't support his mono-coloured ambitions. "I've a strong preference to be aggressive." said the young Canadian, "but in sealed I can see being more mid-range."


"I'll be looking for a reasonable amount of low drops," said Hayne, "but I look more for top end trumps than most people. When I open my pool, I always look for the bombs, then check the depth of the pool. I pull out any unplayables and see what's left. I want to build a cohesive deck, not deck with a poor mix aggression and control; it needs focus."


Wilson continued from Hayne, "After pulling the unplayables, we'll look at all ten colour combinations, deck building each one, and comparing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each."


"In sealed, I'm looking for card value over card synergy." said Hayne. "You have a lot less control over your pool than in draft, and there's a lot more removal floating around, so creatures with synergy lose value. I like value cards, such as [Shaman of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+Spring), better in sealed."


"It's all about power over synergy." reinforced Wilson.

*While the early birds might get the worms, these guys got to sleep in.*

We watched the pair open their sealed with Oliver Oks and Tomoharu Saito, two of the other players with threebyes. What impressed me most was how thorough and methodical their deck building was, carefully building, dismantling, and rebuilding every colour combination time and again.



"It takes a fair amount of mental energy to maintain that focus," Hayne admitted afterwards, "You have to imagine playing each of the decks out against an opponent and evaluate every one."


Wilson laid out his deck to show his results. "I ended up as being relatively aggressive, mainly through evasive creatures, with control elements to slow my opponents down. My main colour had two of my rares, and answers to bombs that the other colours lacked. I think it's definitely a Day 2 deck".


"I'm relatively happy," confessed Hayne, "Not extra happy, but it's solid, I have answers, and I can punish bad draws."


The two immediately launched into a couple of practice games. "Oh man, I played them so badly!" laughed Wilson. "That's why we play," responded Hayne, "To get your head in the game."


With that we wished them good luck in their first round of play at GP Sydney.
