Four-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor Justin Cheung is heralded as one of the top players in the Asia Pacific region and has just returned from Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* with a satisfying 50th place finish.


Wielding Esper Control as his weapon of choice, he has stumbled a little this weekend and would need to win out to make his fifth Grand Prix Top 8. Currently standing at 18 Pro Points, he is also in good shape to repeat the feat of becoming Australian National Champion once again.


His opponent Joshua Foley is at the exact 7-2-1 record and is piloting a unique Bant concoction of his own, featuring [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave), [Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm) and [Selesnya Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Charm) to go along with all the goodies that the Azorius Senate has to offer.


**Game One** 


With both players mulliganing to five, [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) from Cheung seemed more devastating than usual, and knocked one of two [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)s out from Foley's hand.


However, Cheung was the one to stumble on land drops, with just two, and allowed Foley to successfully resolve a topdecked [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave) without contest. However, Foley chose to tick up [Kiora](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave) rather than [Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) her other options and it gave Cheung time to find a third land to cast [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere).


Foley quickly replaced that with [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) and Cheung looked like he was in trouble, until he managed to draw a second [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) two turns later.

Foley forged ahead with [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for 4, restocking his hand while charging in with six Soldier tokens. Cheung was forced to use [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) on one of them, signaling that he did not have the [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) to get out of the fix.


He did have his own [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) though, and managed to stabilize with [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought). A few Planeswalker activations coupled with a massive Sphinx Revelation put Cheung back into the game but Foley wasn't about to give up, sweeping the board thrice with [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict)s before eventually succumbing to the onslaught of 3/3 Soldier tokens.

**Game Two**
With just fifteen minutes left on the clock, Foley decided to bring in [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) and [Archangel of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Thune) to supplement his "[Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm) beatdown plan", but found himself with the grindy triple [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) draw.


After cycling a pair of [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm), Foley's next move was [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought). Cheung stopped it with [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) before untapping and resolving his own copy, which in turn granted him a replacement [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve).


The first of Foley's [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)s netted him Selesnya Charm, [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) and [Archangel of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Thune) but the trinity fell to successive [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict)s.


A brisk counter war ensued when Cheung tried to resolve [Ã†therling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling). Foley attempted [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve), with Cheung showing him the same, but Foley had the last word with [Render Silent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Render+Silent).


This reduced Cheung to just a single card in his feeble grip and that was enough to convince Foley that Cheung was out of countermagic. Foley fired off [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) (for more than I could count) and equalized the score by burying Cheung with card advantage and a duo of [Archangel of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Thune) and [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault).
