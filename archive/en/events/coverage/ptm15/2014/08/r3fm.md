 Jacob Wilson, currently 15th in the Top 25 Player Rankings, has long been touted as one of the Next Big Things in North American *Magic*. He had put up a string of solid finishes, including a Grand Prix win, but it wasn't until his finals appearance at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* that he finally showed what he's made of.




 Josh McClain (Ranked 19th) is still chasing his first PT Top 8, and actually came within a match win of getting there at that same Pro Tour, finishing 11th overall. McClain is best known as a Modern Constructed specialist. In fact, both he and Wilson are Modern Grand Prix Champions. Today they crossed paths in *M15* Limited, McClain with a perfect 2-0 start, and Wilson saddled with an unfortunate draw. McClain had a fast Blue-Black deck featuring multiple [Frost Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Lynx)es, while Wilson was playing a Black-Green deck that took advantage of numerous graveyard synergies and plenty of ways to get value out of the mighty [Roaring Primadox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roaring+Primadox). Oh, and [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker).






*Both No. 19 Ranked Player Josh McClain and No. 15 Ranked Player Jacob Wilson had Platinum locked up, but now both players had their eyes set on bigger accomplishments.*
