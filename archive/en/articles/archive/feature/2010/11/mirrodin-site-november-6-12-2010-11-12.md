Welcome back to "On the Mirrodin Site," where we show off some of the recent highlights from the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/).

On the Phyrexia side, we've got art for something called "Creeping Corrosion" (which may be a sign of things to come) over in the [Forest](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#forests,hotspots;G2;0;). And Roxith, Thane of Rot [continues his story](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#!blog,651).

For the Mirrans, there's a wallpaper for everyone's favorite zero-cost 1/1, [Memnite](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#islands,hotspots;U7;0;)!
