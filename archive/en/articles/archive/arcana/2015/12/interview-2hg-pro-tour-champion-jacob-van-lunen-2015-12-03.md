 Yichao is a writer of words for plays, television, theme parks, and—most recently—Magic: The Gathering. He loves Cube Draft and corgis. 






It's Teams Week here at DailyMTG, and we're jumping in the wayback machine to take a look at the first (and only) Pro Tour to feature a Two-Headed Giant format. [Pro Tour San Diego](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/sliver-kids-stun-san-diego) in 2007 featured 2HG Limited battles, and who better to talk about the event than Jacob Van Lunen, one of the winners of that Pro Tour! I sat down with him to chat about that Pro Tour and what it was like to battle on a team on *Magic*'s biggest stage.
