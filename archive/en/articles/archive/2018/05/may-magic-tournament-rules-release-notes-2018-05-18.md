With the [announcement earlier today](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/ravnica-announcement-day-2018-05-18) of *Guilds of Ravnica*, I am pleased to present this abbreviated Tournament Rules update.


*Magic: The Gathering* Tournament Rules Updates
===============================================


Here are the *Magic: The Gathering* Tournament Rules update notes for the latest release (which can be found [here](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules)), listed by the section number of the rules. To have more context, you should refer to the actual wording in the document itself.


**Section 3.2 (Format and Ratings Categories)**: When the section on Block Constructed was removed in the [April rules update](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/april-magic-tournament-rules-release-notes-2018-04-23), we forgot to remove Block Constructed from this section. Fixed!


**Section 3.7 (New Releases)**: Added the release information for *Guilds of Ravnica*. Also added is the previously announced product *Global Deck Series: Jiang Yanggu & Mu Yanling* here. This product will be legal in Standard, but only in China. Globally, this product will not be legal in Modern. As with all other products, it will be legal in the Eternal Constructed formats (Legacy and Vintage). You can read more about this [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/global-series-meet-jiang-yanggu-and-mu-yanling-2018-05-18).


**Section 4.2 (Tournament Shortcuts)**: The shortcut regarding assigning combat damage in Two-Headed Giant–format tournaments has been updated to reflect the [recent change](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/dominaria-comprehensive-rules-changes-2018-04-13) to the way combat works in Two-Headed Giant.


**Section 6.3 (Standard Format)**: This section has been updated to include *Guilds of Ravnica* and *Global Deck Series: Jiang Yanggu & Mu Yanling*. The sets that will leave Standard when *Guilds of Ravnica* is released have been marked with the rotation date.


**Section 6.4 (Modern Format)**: This section has been updated to include *Guilds of Ravnica*.


**Appendix D (Recommended Booster Mix for Limited Tournaments)**: Various updates and additions due to the announcement of *Guilds of Ravnica*.

That's all for this update! If you have questions about *Magic* Tournament Rules, I recommend the following resources:


***Magic: The Gathering*** **Tournament Rules** (viewable [here](http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules))


This is the main rules document that governs competitive tournament play. It defines:


* The fundamentals parts of a tournament;
* The various roles and responsibilities of participants;
* The mechanics of a tournament;
* The violations that come with tournament play;
* The various formats for tournament play; and
* Sanctioning rules.

**Infraction Procedure Guide** (viewable [here](http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide))


This document provides the recommended penalties and procedures to handle rules violations.

I encourage anyone who is interested in tournament-level *Magic* to read these documents. They are the rules under which a tournament is run, so being familiar with these documents can help you to become a better player. In some cases, the *Magic* Tournament Rules supersede the *Magic* Game Rules, so knowing these rules can keep you from entering some awkward situations. You can also contact Wizards of the Coast Game Support. Information about how to do that can be found [here](https://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2305/).
