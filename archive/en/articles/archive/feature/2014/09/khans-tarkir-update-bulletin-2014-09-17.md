September 17, 2014
 











The winds of change blow once again across the Multiverse, scattering my papers around the office. By this time, we've all been introduced to the world of Tarkir and its five warring clans. Whether you've chosen to embrace the savagery of the Temur or you've chosen one of the lesser clans, I hope you're enjoying all this "wedge" set has to offer. Personally, I can't wait to draft with real cards that won't spontaneously change abilities, sometimes while on the stack.


But, alas, even printed cards undergo text changes from time to time. In fact, I'm here today to tell you about the latest round of Oracle changes and also additions we've made to the Comprehensive Rules. There's nothing too major this time around. *Khans of Tarkir* has only two new keywords, outlast and prowess. Delve and morph already had rules. Ferocious and raid are ability words with no rules attached to them. Modal spells and abilities now appear with bulleted lists. And more! (But not too much more.)


Many changes are the direct result of suggestions sent to us by you, the *Magic* community. Others pop up as we research older cards in the process of templating future sets. *Magic* is a big game, and it has a lot of moving parts. We want all those parts to work together as smoothly as possible. Thanks, as always, go out to the dedicated fans worldwide who bring things to my attention. Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tabakrules) or on Tumblr ([tabakrules.tumblr.com](http://tabakrules.tumblr.com/)) and let's chat!

Oracle Changes
==============


What is Oracle?

*Magic* is a game made up of more than 13,000 interchangeable pieces—the cards. Over the years, we've felt the need to update the wordings of older cards, whether because we've introduced a new keyword, or a card was printed with a mistake, or we have a clearer wording for what a card does, etc. Rather than sneak into your room at night and change your cards with a magic marker, we keep a database of the "modern wordings" (what the cards would say if we printed them today) of every tournament-legal card ever printed. These wordings are considered the official wordings of the cards, and accurately reflect their functions.


You can access a card's Oracle wording by looking it up in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx).



**Modal Spells and Abilities**


We've updated the presentation of modal spells and abilities. Inspired by *Duel Masters* templating technology, each mode will now appear separately in a bulleted list. This will make the cards more pleasant to read. In all, 138 cards were updated.


**Morph Reminder Text**


We made a minor adjustment to the morph reminder text in *Khans of Tarkir*. Instead of saying "You may cast this face down…," we now say "You may cast this card face down…" This change was added to the 117 previous cards with morph as well.


**[Dance of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dance+of+the+Dead)** 


We generally use "return" if you are returning a card from your graveyard to another zone, usually your hand or the battlefield. We use "put" if it's possible the card could be coming from another player's graveyard. [Dance of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dance+of+the+Dead) was on the wrong side of the line. It's also on wrong side of the "number of words we'd like to see on a card" line, but that's a discussion for another day.


*Old wording:*


Enchant creature card in a graveyard


When Dance of the Dead enters the battlefield, if it's on the battlefield, it loses "enchant creature card in a graveyard" and gains "enchant creature put onto the battlefield with Dance of the Dead." Return enchanted creature card to the battlefield tapped under your control and attach Dance of the Dead to it. When Dance of the Dead leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it.


Hi there. This wasn't really part of the old wording. I'm just curious if you're actually reading this.


Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 and doesn't untap during its controller's untap step. At the beginning of the upkeep of enchanted creature's controller, that player may pay 1oB. If he or she does, untap that creature.


*New wording:*


Enchant creature card in a graveyard


When Dance of the Dead enters the battlefield, if it's on the battlefield, it loses "enchant creature card in a graveyard" and gains "enchant creature put onto the battlefield with Dance of the Dead." Put enchanted creature card onto the battlefield tapped under your control and attach Dance of the Dead to it. When Dance of the Dead leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it.


Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 and doesn't untap during its controller's untap step.


At the beginning of the upkeep of enchanted creature's controller, that player may pay 1oB. If he or she does, untap that creature.


**[Hooded Horror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hooded+Horror)** 


We generally use "as long as" for conditions that are continuously true, even if they're only relevant for at a specified point.


*Old wording:*


Hooded Horror can't be blocked if defending player controls the most creatures or is tied for the most.


*New wording:*


Hooded Horror can't be blocked as long as defending player controls the most creatures or is tied for the most.


**[Leech Bonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leech+Bonder)** 


We generally use "another target creature" to mean "target creature other than this one" on abilities of creatures. Cards like [Cone of Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cone+of+Flame) and [Incremental Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incremental+Growth) give us precedent with their use of "third target creature." Of course, those are sorceries, so they don't have to worry about possible confusion with "another."


*Old wording:*


Leech Bonder enters the battlefield with two -1/-1 counters on it. U, Q: Move a counter from target creature onto another target creature. *(Q is the untap symbol.)*


*New wording:*


Leech Bonder enters the battlefield with two -1/-1 counters on it.


U, Q: Move a counter from target creature onto a second target creature. *(Q is the untap symbol.)*


**[Phyrexian Splicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Splicer)** 


We generally use modal technology only when different effects are involved. [Phyrexian Splicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Splicer) had a slightly bizarre take on this, using it to choose between different targeting requirements. While the card does want the ability chosen on announcement, we found a slightly clearer way to express it.


*Old wording:*


2, T: Choose one—flying; first strike; shadow; or trample. Target creature with that ability loses it until end of turn and another target creature gains it until end of turn.


*New wording:*


2, T, Choose flying, first strike, trample, or shadow: Until end of turn, target creature with the chosen ability loses it and another target creature gains it.


**[Sheltering Word](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sheltering+Word)** 


We generally use modified reminder text when it's sufficiently far away from the keyword, but this one was missing a word.


*Old wording:*


Target creature you control gains hexproof until end of turn. You gain life equal to that creature's toughness. *(A creature with hexproof can't be the target of spells or abilities opponents control.)*


*New wording:*


Target creature you control gains hexproof until end of turn. You gain life equal to that creature's toughness. *(A creature with hexproof can't be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.)*


**[Shirei, Shizo's Caretaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shirei%2C+Shizo%27s+Caretaker)** 


We commanderly don't need to specify "under your control" when you are returning a card from your graveyard to the battlefield. Shirei did this unnecessarily.


*Old wording:*


Whenever a creature with power 1 or less is put into your graveyard from the battlefield, you may return that card to the battlefield under your control at the beginning of the next end step if Shirei, Shizo's Caretaker is still on the battlefield.


*New wording:*


Whenever a creature with power 1 or less is put into your graveyard from the battlefield, you may return that card to the battlefield at the beginning of the next end step if Shirei, Shizo's Caretaker is still on the battlefield.

* Comprehensive Rulebook Changes



Comprehensive Rulebook Changes
==============================


What are the Comprehensive Rules?

*Magic* is complicated. No, really. When you have more than 13,000 interchangeable game pieces, you get some freaky interactions. The Comprehensive Rules cover everything the game has ever come up with, from basic game play structure, to every keyword ever, to entire pages dedicated to single bizarre cards (hello, [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated)!). The Comprehensive Rules are, well, comprehensive…but they're also obtuse, unfriendly, and looooong. They're not intended to be a player resource—they're a judge resource, a rules guru resource, and a place to store definitive answers. In fact, I honestly recommend never reading them. For a much friendlier rulebook that is intended to be a player resource, check out the [Rules Page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/rules) and download the [Basic Rulebook](http://media.wizards.com/2014/docs/EN_M15_QckStrtBklt_LR_Crop.pdf) (4.37 MB PDF). It doesn't have sections about phasing or subgames…but you'll never miss them.



**112.11.**


This rule was created a few updates ago to handle the new "can't have [keyword]" functionality seen on the Archetypes in *Born of the Gods*. It specified that if a resolving spell or ability tried to create a continuous effect that added the specified ability to a creature, that effect wasn't created. Well, that's not entirely true in the case where the continuous effect does more than one thing. Let's say my opponent controls an [Archetype of Courage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype+of+Courage) and I target one of my creatures with [Aerial Maneuver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aerial+Maneuver). The intent is that my creature still gets the +1/+1 and flying. I tweaked the language to make this true.


**205.3m**


Naga is added to the list of creature typesssssssss.


**207.2c**


Ferocious and raid are added to the list of ability words.


**208.2b**


This rule talks about static abilities that create replacement effects that set a creature's power and toughness to one of a number of specific values as it enters the battlefield or is turned face up. In other words, it makes [Primal Clay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Clay) and [Aquamorph Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity) work. However, the rule referred to the values as "choices" and to the characteristics "chosen." Unfortunately, [Molten Sentry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Sentry)'s power and toughness are determined by fate, not by choice. I tweaked the language to account for this.


**500.7.**


Added a sentence to clarify what happens when two or more players get extra turns that were created at the same time, as can happen if multiple copies of [Ugin's Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%27s+Nexus) would be put into a graveyard at the same time.


**510.2.**


Added missing quotation marks in the example.


**700.2.**


The description of modal spells and abilities now mentions the snazzy new bulleted lists.


**702.50a**


I assume the missing quotation marks in the example here were on vacation with the ones missing from 510.2. Well they're both back.


**702.100b**


I corrected an instance of my most common typo (of/if).


**702.106.**


The new rule for outlast.


**702.107.**


The new rule for prowess.


**706.2.**


This rule talks about copiable values and how a copy acquires the characteristics and, for an object on the stack, the choices made when casting or activating it. Those copiable values are derived from the object's text as modified by other copy effects, by "as…enters the battlefield" and "as…is turned face up" abilities that set characteristics, and by abilities that caused the object to be face down. It's that middle part that presented a slight issue.


This rule is trying to cover cases like the aforementioned [Primal Clay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Clay). But consider a creature like [Pouncing Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pouncing+Kavu). It has an ability that sets characteristics as it enters the battlefield, namely whether or not it has haste. But it's just a continuous effect that applies to [Pouncing Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pouncing+Kavu), not unlike [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth), so it really shouldn't be copiable. The update to this rule excludes these types of effects while making sure [Primal Clay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Clay)'s chosen characteristics are still copiable.


**707.2a**


This rule gives characteristics to face-up permanents that are turned face down. I extended it to include objects that enter the battlefield face down but weren't cast as face-down spells, such as a returning [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix).


**Glossary**
