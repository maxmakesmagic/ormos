Brace yourself for a trip to the largest **Magic: The Gathering** tournament of all time at [Grand Prix Las Vegas](/en/events/coverage/oliver-modern-master-las-vegas). Witness the *Modern Masters* Limited format on rare display at a major tournament, meet one of **Magic**'s most morbid illustrators, get personal with some fresh-faced newlyweds, and take in the sights and sounds of a convention hall filled with more than 4,000 **Magic** players. **Magic** pros and newcomers alike attempt to become *Modern Masters* in Walking the Planes Episode #15: "Vegas Baby."
