It is time, once again, to look at some of **Magic**'s earliest playtest cards! One of the neat aspects of these (aside from the fact that they predate the game itself) is the snippets of art used to illustrate each card. For example, from [this Arcana](/en/articles/archive/alpha-playtest-cards-more-2009-10-28), here's [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God):


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/308_wrath.jpg)Ha ha! Awesome! So here's today's game: you get to see just the art from some playtest cards, then you guess what Alpha card would have been associated with that art. Just click on the link when you're ready to see the full playtest card. Ready? Let's go!

If you're enjoyed this game, you might be interested to try another set of Alpha playtest cards in [this Arcana from 2008](/en/articles/archive/alpha-playtest-art-2008-08-28) or [this one from 2009](/en/articles/archive/alpha-playtest-art-2009-01-21)!
