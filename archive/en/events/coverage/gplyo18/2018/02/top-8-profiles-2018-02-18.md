**Name:** Grzegorz Kowalski


**Age:** 26


**Occupation:** Wannabe *Magic* pro


**Hometown:** Wroclaw, Poland


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Four Grand Prix Top 8s, two Pro Tour Top 16s, second at the 2017 World *Magic* Cup with Team Poland.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Red-Green "Fork" Eldrazi. It's a great deck that we figured out before the Pro Tour. In the end, nobody from the team played it, except for me. Deck knows that I trusted it and is paying off dividends.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Forked Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt). Without it the deck doesn't exist!


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives). Mass removal is great. It's also fun to kill [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) with Explosives playing only a two-color deck.

**Occupation:** Pro slacker


**Hometown:** Ljubljana, Slovenia

Big Tron. I was playing it before you guys decided to ban my [Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin), and since Lantern won the Pro Tour I was hoping it would be popular.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


The one and only [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated), but only on turn three, or [Expedition Map](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map) when I had two Tron parts.

[Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) to kill opponents' [Stony Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stony+Silence). [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer) was awesome as well, but when [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) is legal I'm not sure how good it is going to be.
