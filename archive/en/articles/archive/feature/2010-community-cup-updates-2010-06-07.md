The 2010 Community Cup is going on this week! Follow the [Community Cup results](/en/events/coverage/community-team-captures-cup) and root your team on! Don't forget to follow additional coverage on [Robot Viking](http://www.robotviking.com/), [TheStarkingtonPost.com](http://www.thestarkingtonpost.com/), and the [**Magic Online** Group page](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/pro-tour-gatecrash-qualifier-season-top-8-standard-decklists-2015-50). 

Want to meet your [2010 **Magic Online** Community Cup Team](/en/articles/archive/magic-online-community-cup-2010-04-30) members in person? Want to preview the new [*Archenemy*](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/432&dcmp=ilc-mtgrss#68452) decks before they are on sale? Want to get a few games in against **Wizards of the Coast** employees? 

If so, bring your Standard or EDH decks and join us at 6pm Tuesday, June 8th at [Uncle's Games](http://www.unclesgames.com/stores.php?osCsid=ensmmii9en6u07t140n4v6m1e6) in the Crossroads Mall in Bellevue. This year the Community Team and a handful of **Wizards** staff will be hanging out and playing **Magic**, so come on by and say hello, play some games, and just have a good time. 

See you there!

The Community Team has begun to arrive in beautiful Renton, WA, chomping at the bit to square off against the **Wizards of the Coast Team** and battle for glory and a *Mirrodin* block draft for the public at large! Make sure you have made your contribution to the Community Cup threads so you too can [reap the rewards](/en/articles/archive/2010-community-cup-limited-formats-2010-05-08) of a Community Team victory! 

Use the schedule below to follow along in **Magic Online** and root for your team!
