Angry Angry Zombies
===================

Greetings, laboratorians! *Modern Masters* has hit the shelves, and cards we haven't seen in years have become much more available. Today, I'll be looking at a pair of decks that take advantage of some of these cards. 

 The first card I'll be looking at is [Bridge from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below). Not only has the card been reprinted, it has some awesome new art as well. The card has a history of abuse in dredge decks, and as luck would have it, *Modern Masters* contains quite a few cards with dredge as well. Although [Bridge from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) is traditionally used with cards like [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) and [Dread Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return), I have something a little different in mind. 

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl251_bridgefrombelow.jpg)[Bridge from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) | Art by [Daarken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=[%22Daarken%22])

[Hell's Caretaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Caretaker) can sacrifice a creature (including itself) at any time, including during your upkeep, to return a creature from your graveyard to the battlefield. If you have another copy of [Hell's Caretaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Caretaker) in your graveyard, you could return that. Unfortunately, you won't be able to activate it the turn it enters the battlefield under your control. Unless... 

 Unless you can give it haste! If you can do that, the two [Hell's Caretaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Caretaker)s can return each other indefinitely. With [Bridge from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) in your graveyard, that gives you an unlimited number of Zombie tokens. Oh yeah, and the Zombies can have haste too depending how you provide haste to your army.
