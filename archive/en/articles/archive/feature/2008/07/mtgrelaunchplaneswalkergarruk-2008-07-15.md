*Garruk Wildspeaker is a planeswalker who wields green magic. His specialty is creature magic: spells that coax abundant mana from the land, summon wild beasts, and unleash the ferocity and power of his summoned creatures.*


Garruk is a hunter to the core, a planeswalking predator whose hunting ground is the entire Multiverse. Gripped with a need to test his might and resolve against greater and greater challenges, his life's calling has become an endless hunt of the most ferocious and dangerous game that each plane can offer.


So far Garruk's travels have brought him experiences and trials he never could have imagined. The dangers he's faced have forced his abilities in druidism and creature summoning far past their prior limits, and each day his collection of trophies grows. But recently he's faced a new kind of prey: a fellow planeswalker.


This is new territory for Garruk. Never before has his quarry been so crafty, so resourceful, or so elusive. Garruk's true hunt has just begun.
