At the request of organizers and players, the Wizards Play Network (WPN) is proud to announce its support for Casual Play events, beginning October 3, 2008. Casual Play is an excellent way to experience **Magic: The Gathering** in a social, low-stress environment, where the spirit of friendly competition dominates. 

With Casual Play, you have the opportunity to play in an event, organize an event, or both. The rules are minimal and the format is entirely up to the organizer and players. Casual Play events may be held at any public venue, such as a retail store, library, or meeting hall.
