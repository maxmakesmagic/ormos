When you write an article that involves a preview card, you know that most of the people aren't coming to read what you're writing, they just want to see the card. I picture most of those people chanting, "Preview card!" like old-school zombies chant, "Brains!" They just keep chanting, unwilling to listen to anything.

"I have an exciting new card to reveal for you! Golgari players are going to be so excit..."

"Preview card!"

"...ted to see it. The enchantment costs..."

"Preview card!"

"...six mana but with..."

"PREVIEW CARD!"

Okay, okay, cut out your chanting and I'll give you Deadbridge Chant!

Option One: Do Nothing
 By do nothing, I mean you are just going to add it to your black and green deck and see what happens. You could just let it ride. Toss your ten cards in the graveyard on top of the others that are already there and just play the random game. Sometimes you randomly choose a land, sometimes you luck out and get [Kokusho, the Evening Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star).
