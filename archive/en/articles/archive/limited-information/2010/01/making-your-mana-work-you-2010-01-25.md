It is common knowledge that when you are building a Sealed Deck or Draft deck in a non-multicolor-intensive format, you generally want to stick to two colors, or two colors and a light splash. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule of thumb. You might be able to build a five-color deck, or you might be able to build a monocolored deck, or you might be able to build a nearly monocolored deck with a light splash. But those are all just exceptions, right? Occasionally you get the right set of cards to build that five-color or monocolored deck (whether intentionally or not) and you can go with that, but otherwise you're going to have a pretty even split between your colors, right?

Not quite.

A heavy base color plus a light to medium-sized splash of a support color is actually one of the most attractive options that you can find, especially in color-intensive formats such as *Zendikar* and the upcoming *Zendikar* / *Worldwake*.
