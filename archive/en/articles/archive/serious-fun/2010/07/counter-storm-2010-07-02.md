M[ana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=ana+Leak) is being reprinted. It's finally settled in to the minds of the more competitive crowd that, yes, a flexible early general spell deterrent is back. While [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel), [Deprive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive) and [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) (and to a lesser extent [Essence Scatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter)) have served well those who choose to suit up in blue, [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) is something a little different.

I won't unload about the strategic implications of [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) but it suffices to say that the excitement about a reprint is a demonstration of just how much *any* card can be really exciting in some ways. While I'm not as excited about [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) as others, there is something else that always makes me smile: how many of you remember [Leviathan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leviathan)?
