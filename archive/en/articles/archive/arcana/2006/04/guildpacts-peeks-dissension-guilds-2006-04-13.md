Just before the release of *Guildpact*, we [scanned *Ravnica* cards](/en/articles/archive/evidence-other-guilds-2005-11-15) for subtle references to future guilds. Today we take another stroll down Flavor Lane on a scouting mission for clues about the upcoming guilds of *Dissension*. 

![Azorius](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1056_AzoriusCrest.jpg)### Azorius

The white-blue Azorius Senate crops up in several spots in *Guildpact* cards, if you look closely enough. It's not just the anti-Gruul attitude of flavor text attributed to "Trigori, Azorius senator" ([Savage Twister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Twister), but see also Trigori sounding off in the flavor text of *Ravnica's* 
[Mindmoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindmoil) and [Incite Hysteria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incite+Hysteria)). You can also see a tease of the Azorius costuming and race composition in *Guildpact* art:

![Simic](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1056_SimicCrest.jpg)### Simic

*Guildpact* flavor text is somewhat less forthcoming about the blue-green biomancers of the Simic guild: they're mentioned on [Daggerclaw Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daggerclaw+Imp) and [Poisonbelly Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Poisonbelly+Ogre). In addition, just one piece of art is unequivocally Simic, but it's a good close-up of a Simic elf on the black removal spell [Douse in Gloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Douse+in+Gloom):

![Rakdos](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1056_RakdosCrest.jpg)### Rakdos

The red-black Cult of Rakdos is similarly shrouded in mystery, with again only two *Guildpact* references to them in flavor text. One is [Martyred Rusalka](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martyred+Rusalka) (whose story is told by Matt Cavotta in [this in-character edition](/en/articles/archive/precious-gold-2006-03-29) of the Taste the Magic column), and the other is the aforementioned [Daggerclaw Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daggerclaw+Imp). Rakdos is just as scarce in *Guildpact* card art, but one Rakdos guildmember is shown getting attacked, due to his cologne of griffin prey-pheromone, in the art of [Harrier Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrier+Griffin).
