 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 






In case you missed it last Sunday, the [@wizards\_magic](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic) Twitter account told a little story about a party that began like this:



> 
> Nicol Bolas welcomed everyone to Sorin's manor for the game, promising the host would return shortly [#WeekendatSorins](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeekendatSorins?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com/RnC5VIyFe5](http://t.co/RnC5VIyFe5)

You might have noticed in there the second wave of [Funko Pop! Planeswalkers](http://funko.com/collections/magic-the-gathering) figures. Perhaps you'd like to see more pictures of them? Up close? With their packaging? Great! Here you go:
