**Name:** Tate Donovan


**Age:** 27


**Occupation:** Butcher


**Hometown:** Phoenix


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  Scrubbed out of Nationals last year


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?** Green-White Taxes. I just want to cast Thalia and blow up lands.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** Thalia, because she’s Thalia.


**What was your best sideboard card?** [Mark of Asylum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+Asylum). It protects all your Bears and everyone has to read it.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?** Not really.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** A lot. First Top 8 at a Grand Prix and my first Pro Tour! I’m very excited to go back to Richmond and redeem myself.

**Name:** Alexander Corwith


**Age:** 20


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Glendale


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  I watched all of Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?** Mono-Green Tron. I like Karn and Emrakul.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End). [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) is good and fun *Magic* design.


**What was your best sideboard card?** [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer). It makes Storm not an instant loss.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?** [Deflecting Palm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflecting+Palm).


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** It is cool I suppose. This redeems my gaming career.

**Name:** Matt Nass


**Age:** 26


**Occupation:** Game Designer


**Hometown:** Stanford!


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  Pro Tour Top 8 appearance, nine Grand Prix Top 8s counting this.


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?** [Krark-Clan Ironworks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks). Tested a ton on *Magic Online.*


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** [Krark-Clan Ironworks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks), but the most surprising one was [Buried Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Ruin).


**What was your best sideboard card?** None, my main deck did most of the work.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?** Played against Thalia a bunch, which is scary.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** A better chance at my first Platinum and Worlds appearance.

**Name:** Vikram Kudva


**Age:** 25


**Occupation:** Software Developer


**Hometown:** Seattle, WA


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  Multiple Top 32s at Grand Prix. Won an SCG Open in Denver in 2015. Been to a couple of Pro Tours.


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?** Bant Knightfall. I thought it would be the best iteration of a Company deck to jam multiple combos.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). Great midrange and combo card.


**What was your best sideboard card?** [Worship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship). Not many people are ready for it, and I thought Eldrazi would be everywhere to beat Jund.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?** I didn’t expect some pros to be on [Krark-Clan Ironworks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks), but my test group found the interaction a couple of months ago, so I knew it was good.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** This is my first Grand Prix Top 8, so it means a lot.

**Name:** Sung-Jin Ahn


**Age:** 23


**Occupation:** Quitting my job if I win this GP.


**Hometown:** Boulder, Colorado


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  0-5 at GP Santa Clara, cash finish at GP OKC.


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?** Bright to Light [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). I think the format has slowed down enough for the deck to do well. I like control decks with a combo finish. Also all my friends thought it was bad.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). You can’t win if you don’t stop your opponent from winning.


**What was your best sideboard card?** [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives). Because I killed myself by running [Madcap Experiment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Madcap+Experiment) into it and played much tighter the rest of the way.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?** [Krark-Clan Ironworks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks). I thought that deck was a meme.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** That my practice hasn’t been a waste of time.

**Name:** Steve Locke


**Age:** 30


**Occupation:** Environmental Engineer


**Hometown:** Ames, IA


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  Champion Grand Prix Minneapolis 2017


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?** Humans. I think it is a top five Modern deck and suits my playstyle


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** Every piece plays its part.


**What was your best sideboard card?** [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember).


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?** [Krark-Clan Ironworks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks).


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** I don’t have to play Sealed Deck at the upcoming RPTQ now.

**Name:** Michael Hughes


**Age:** 30


**Occupation:** Store Manager


**Hometown:** Los Angeles


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  RPTQ qualifications


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?** Red-Green Eldrazi because a pile of hyper-efficient threats and removal seemed good.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** [Eldrazi Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple). It enables the most busted draws and can be found off of [Matter Reshaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matter+Reshaper) and [Ancient Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Stirrings).


**What was your best sideboard card?** Grafdigger’s Cage due to the deck being soft to graveyard strategies.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?** I saw lots of artifact-based decks, which surprised me, but it makes sense due to fewer [Stony Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stony+Silence) being around.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** Diligence and persistence pays off!

**Name:** Pierson Laughlin


**Age:** 25


**Occupation:** NFL/NBA Drug Tester


**Hometown:** Hanford, CA


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  Taught Cody Lingelbach everything he knows.


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?** Jund. I’ve been playing the deck for a long time but had never cast a [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) before Round 1 of this tournament, so I had to know what the hype was about.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) - it’s just good in every matchup.


**What was your best sideboard card?** [Collective Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality). It’s really versatile and leads to some huge blowouts against Burn.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?** [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) - the hype was real.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** Glad to be back on the Pro Tour after a lot of near-misses.
