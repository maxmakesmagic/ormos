*Lorwyn*'s cycle of uncommon "Vivid" lands help multicolor decks fix their mana, and also show off some of the more colorful places on the plane of Lorwyn.



![Vivid Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vivid+Grove)

The art description of each card in the cycle contained a pretty simple request: to show a standard color-aligned location (a meadow, a creek, a marsh, a crag, or a grove) but with a rainbow of color somewhere in the piece. The five artists commissioned to illustrate the cards each solved the puzzle in a different way. Howard Lyon's [Vivid Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivid+Grove) shows a spectrum of sunlight filtering through the forest canopy, while Martina Pilcerova's [Vivid Crag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivid+Crag) shows prismatic light glinting off of shards of rock. Fred Fields's [Vivid Creek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivid+Creek) has the spray of a short waterfall creating the rainbow effect, and Rob Alexander's [Vivid Meadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivid+Meadow) shows a traditional rainbow bending across the sky above the plain. Finally, John Avon's [Vivid Marsh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivid+Marsh) brings in the prismatic effect by showing an oily residue reflecting in the murky water. Check them all out below. Got a favorite?
