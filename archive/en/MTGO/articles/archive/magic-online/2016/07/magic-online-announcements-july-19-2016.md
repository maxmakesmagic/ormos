*Magic 2010* Flashback Drafts begin Wednesday, July 20, after the downtime, and runs until the downtime on July 27. The [full Flashback Draft schedule](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/year-of-modern-flashbacks-2015-12-14) has been updated with formats throughout the rest of the year, so mark your calendar for the formats you're most excited about!


**Please Note:**  After Triple *Magic 2010* Flashback Drafts, we'll be taking a break from Flashbacks for *Eldritch Moon* from July 27 to August 17.
