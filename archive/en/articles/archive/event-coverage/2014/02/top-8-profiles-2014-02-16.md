### Jean-Mary "Lejay" Accart


**Age:** 31  
**Hometown:** Paris, France  
**Occupation:** Professional Legacy player


 

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Various Legacy wins, Top 8s of small and big tournaments. I have been the main administrator for Legacy-France for six years. I innovated Omni-Tell with a friend and designed Counter-Grizzly. I'm also known as the best Doomsday player in the world.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Imperial Painter for metagaming purposes. I had high expectations and still wanted to have an edge against very good players on Day 2. Painter is good versus what I expected and the predators thereof.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

Nothing. If I wanted to change something I would talk to Jack Kitchen first. Thanks goes to him for the decklist and tips.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  

Altopiano, buy them while they are cheap!

### Stefan Böttcher


**Age:** 24  
**Hometown:** Wolfsburg, Germany  
**Occupation:** Production worker


 

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Top 8 at the Magic "Keller" in Hanover.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Deathblade. My friend didn't want to lend me his Sneak & Show and I had experience with Stoneblade.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

Nothing.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Entreat the Angels](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) and [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant).

### Loïc Le Briand


**Age:** 29  
**Hometown:** Nancy, France  
**Occupation:** Business


 

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Top 8 at Grand Prix Lille 2005, some Top 64s, played several Pro Tours, and won an FNM!


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Reanimator. Great against a field of combo, and it's really exciting to play with [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) on turn one.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

Maybe the [Empyrial Archangel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empyrial+Archangel) in the sideboard. I just couldn't find any better creature.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand).

**Occupation:** Software designer


 

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Grand Prix Madrid Day 2, Top 8 at some PTQs, and won some Legacy tournaments in Spain.

Team America [BUG Delver] with "Good Game Nemesis" [[True-Name Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis)]. A friend of mine designed this decklist, and I think it's very good.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

One more [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), one less [Disfigure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure) in the sideboard because [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) can kill [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Tombstalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tombstalker).


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm).

### Javier Dominguez


**Age:** 26  
**Hometown:** Palau-Solita i Plegamans, Spain  
**Occupation:** Grinder


 

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Made Cephalid Breakfast, won Spanish Nationals.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

BUG Delver because I didn't want to choose between [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) and [Deathrite Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman).


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

Would add more [Dark Confidants](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidants), they overperformed.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  

Probably [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)/[Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm).

### Philipp Schönegger


**Age:** 20  
**Hometown:** Deutschlandsberg, Austria  
**Occupation:** Student


 

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Top 64 at Grand Prix Strasbourg.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Miracles, simply because I've been playing it for about two years and it's great.

If people catch up on Miracles, I might have to make adjustments for the mirror, otherwise nothing.

### Maxime Gilles

**Hometown:** Lyon, France  
**Occupation:** Computer engineer

Multiple Top 8s in France.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

UWr Miracles because it's my favorite deck and very well adapted to the metagame.

Nothing. It's the best deck.

### Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa


**Age:** 26  
**Hometown:** Porto Alegre, Brazil  
**Occupation:** Magic player


 

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Nine Pro Tour Top 8s, Hall of Fame.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

UWr Miracles. I really like blue in Legacy but I don't like the Delver decks and didn't want to play combo.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

Probably add another [Tundra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tundra)-there were three games where I wanted to fetch for a third and couldn't.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) makes your deck better in the late game, sets up miracles, and lets you beat heavy discard decks.
