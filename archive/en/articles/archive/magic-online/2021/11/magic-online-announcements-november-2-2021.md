Showcase Challenge Weekends
---------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend. These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and a Set Championship invitation.


First up on Saturday, November 6, we have the Pauper Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC), and on Sunday, November 7, we have the Legacy Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (16:00 UTC). Then next week on Saturday, November 13, we have the Modern Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (16:00 UTC), and on Sunday, November 14, we finish things off with the Pioneer Showcase Challenge at 6 a.m. PT (14:00). Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in December.
