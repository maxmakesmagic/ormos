BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT," YOU: (A) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS USER AGREEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY; (B) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS; AND (C) ARE AUTHORIZED AND ABLE TO ACCEPT THIS USER AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS USER AGREEMENT DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE, CREATE AN ACCOUNT OR PLAY THE GAME.



USE OF THE GAME, THE GAME SERVICE, YOUR ACCOUNTS AND SOFTWARE ARE SUBJECT TO THIS USER AGREEMENT, WIZARDS' CODE OF CONDUCT (<http://company.wizards.com/policies/web/conduct>), THE *MAGIC ONLINE* PRIVACY (<http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-privacy-policy>), AND PAYMENT PAGE (<http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-payments>), ALL INCORPORATED BY THIS REFERENCE.

YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE GAME AFTER ANY SUCH CHANGE CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SAID CHANGE AND WIZARDS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU AS A RESULT.





FOR GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, THE SUFFICIENCY OF WHICH IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED, THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:



**1. Game Description.** *Magic Online* is an online game service ("Game Service") that allows you to play the Game when you: (a) download and install a copy of the Game client from the Wizards' website or a designated partner site ("Download") which includes software and associated media, printed materials and/or electronic documentation; (b) log in to the Game client using your user name and password from your *Magic: The Gathering* Online account ("MTGO Account") via the Game Service ("Account")(MTGO Account and Account collectively referenced hereafter as your "Accounts"); and (c) utilize any software programs provided to you as an Account holder through the Game Service (together with the Download, hereinafter, "Software").



In the Game, you will receive access to a library of licensed digital objects that depict physical *Magic: The Gathering* trading cards ("Digital Objects"). By playing the Game, you receive a limited license for the right to use such Digital Objects solely for the purpose of playing the Game.



**2. Eligibility.**


2.1 General. The Game and Game Service are available only to individuals eighteen (18) years of age and older. If you are between the ages of thirteen (13) and eighteen (18), your parent or guardian must complete the registration process, in which case the parent or guardian will take full responsibility for all obligations under this User Agreement. By clicking the "I Accept" button you represent that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age and are either accepting this User Agreement on behalf of yourself or on behalf of your child. Your Accounts are personal to you and may not be transferred, sold or used by anyone else unless you are a parent or guardian, in which case you may permit one child to use the Account instead of yourself. Regardless, you are liable for all activities conducted through your Accounts.




**2.2 Tournaments and Events.**


(a) Availability and Adjudication. The Game Service may offer many types of events, leagues, tournaments, formats, promotions and game types. However, certain types of events, promotions, leagues, tournaments, formats and game types may not be available in all locations or jurisdictions. By playing the Game or use the Game Service, you acknowledge and agree that Wizards may, in its sole discretion, start, end, modify, or limit any event, league, tournament, format, promotion or game type at any time and for any reason with no liability to you. Additionally, Wizards reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to adjudicate any game, match, tournament or event result. As an example, if a player drops from a match during a tournament, we may award the match win and any accompanying points to the non-dropping player.



(b) Eligibility (United States). You must be physically located in a U.S. state in which participation in the tournaments offered through the Game Service is unrestricted by law. Rules governing sweepstakes, contests and tournaments with entry fees and/or prizes are established by individual states. Based on those laws, residents of the following states may not participate in fee-based tournaments with prizes through the Game Service: Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington.



(c) Eligibility (Non-U.S.). You are subject to all laws of the state, province and/or country in which you reside and from which you access the Game Service and you are solely responsible for obeying those laws. You agree that Wizards cannot be held liable if laws applicable to you restrict or prohibit your participation. Wizards makes no representations or warranties, implicit or explicit, as to your legal right to participate in any tournament offered on or through the Game Service, nor will any person affiliated with or claiming affiliation with Wizards have authority to make any such representations or warranties.



**3. Contests; Promotions; Redemption Codes.** The Game and Game Service may allow you to participate in contests, promotions or similar events (including, without limitation, organized play events) that may offer prizes or require you to provide additional information about yourself. Each contest, promotion or other such event may have its own rules, which you must read and agree to before you participate. Additionally, Wizards may distribute promotional codes that may be redeemed by you for licenses to Digital Items (“Promotional Codes”, each a “Promotional Code”). Promotional Codes may be valid for a limited time only. Some Promotional Codes may have additional terms and conditions that will govern the use and availability of such Promotional Codes. Promotional Codes are personal to you, are non-transferable, and have a value limited to $0.001 U.S.D. The use of Promotional Codes in unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes, or for other promotional purposes is strictly prohibited.



**4. Streaming.** Wizards encourages you and other members of the Wizards community to stream and record your play and other events and interests arising from Wizards' games. However, you must obtain permission from any other person that may appear in your video streams and you must obtain permission from any third party intellectual rights holders. All videos and streams must be non-commercial in nature and may not feature or promote competing games or services. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all content appearing in your videos and live streams.



**5. Physical Redemption**. The Game Service provides a promotion whereby players can voluntarily terminate a portion of their limited license to use certain Digital Objects for a corresponding set of physical *Magic: The Gathering* cards ("Physical Redemption"). Physical Redemption is only available in certain markets and may only be available for specific sets as determined by Wizards in its discretion. Available sets may change from time to time and rotate in availability. WIZARDS MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT A CERTAIN SET WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR PHYSICAL REDEMPTION OR THAT THE PHYSICAL REDEMPTION PROMOTION WILL AVAILABLE TO YOU. In order to participate in the Physical Redemption program, you must: (a) obtain the right to use all of the Digital Objects in a redeemable set, where such Digital Objects are in your Accounts; (b) request Physical Redemption for such redeemable set during its eligibility period as listed here: <http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-redemption-policies-2014-02-04>; and (c) pay all shipping and handling and other fees assessed by Wizards. The Digital Objects will then be removed from your Accounts and the license granted by Wizards to you for those Digital Objects will terminate and all rights to said Digital Objects will revert to Wizards. Wizards reserves the right to cancel or modify the Physical Redemption program at any time including by limiting the number of sets that can be exchanged, limiting the number of Digital Objects released for use, or charging additional fees for this service. A partial license termination of Digital Objects may only be redeemed for physical *Magic: The Gathering* Cards in a full set. A "full set" means one of each card from the expansion or base set to which it relates.



**6. Fees and Payments.** Fees for Game products and billing procedures are detailed on the Payment Page (<http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-payments>). All fees are non-refundable, unless otherwise expressly stated for the product. Upon your acceptance of this User Agreement, you authorize us to charge your credit card or PayPal account for any applicable fees plus taxes. If your credit card cannot be processed at any time, your Accounts, and this User Agreement, may be immediately terminated. Prices and fees apply to the purchase or redemption of Game products including, without limitation, Digital Objects, booster packs, theme decks, tournament packs, and tournament tickets. Wizards may change its Game products or fees and/or billing procedures upon notice of the changes that will be posted on the Payment Page. The Game may also offer special tournament events with special features of offerings such as using specific Digital Objects or a Promotional Code for a period of time (a "Special Event"). Specific details and terms regarding a Special Event are detailed in applicable point of sale information and are incorporated by this reference. Wizards uses third party payment providers (e.g., [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/), [Chase Paymentech](https://www.chasepaymentech.com/), and [Digital River](http://www.digitalriver.com/)) to authenticate payment. When you purchase Game products, you are not interacting with Wizards, but rather our third party partners. Please read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of applicable third party partners to understand their terms and conditions.



You are solely responsible for reviewing the Payment Page to obtain timely notice of such changes as well as any point of sale information for a Special Event; no refunds will be given unless based upon a technical issue inherent in the Game Service or fraud (after a complete review) and only in Wizards sole discretion. If any such change is unacceptable to you, you may terminate your Accounts as provided in Section 15. Your continued use of the Game and Game Service after posting of the changes on the Payment Page will indicate acceptance of such changes. You are fully liable for all charges under your Account, including any unauthorized charges. When you pay for any charges by credit card, you represent to Wizards that you are the authorized user of such credit card. You agree to promptly notify Wizards of any changes to your credit card account number, its expiration date and/or your billing address, and you agree to promptly notify Wizards if your credit card expires or is canceled for any reason.



**7. Security and Passwords.** You are solely responsible and liable for all activity occurring under your Accounts. Remember, Wizards will never ask you for your password; as such you should never disclose your password to anyone. Although Wizards may offer a feature that allows you to "save" or "remember" your password on your hard drive, this feature makes it possible for third parties to access your computer and thus your Accounts. Should you choose to utilize the password memory feature, it is at your own risk. Any attempt to deceive another user for the purposes of illicitly obtaining cards, passwords, account information etc. (aka "scamming") is prohibited and may result in the immediate deactivation of your Accounts.



**8. Beta Releases.** In the event the Game, the Game Service, your Accounts, the Download, the Software and/or the Forums (or any portions and/or features thereof) are released as "beta" releases, as designated by Wizards (each a "Beta"), this Section 8 applies. You acknowledge and agree that a Beta may contain more or less features than the final release of the same or similar product that Wizards intends to release. While Wizards intends to distribute a final release of a Beta, it reserves the right at any time not to release a final release of a Beta or, if released, to alter features, specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, general availability or other characteristics. You agree that Beta release versions may not be suitable for production use and may contain errors affecting proper operation and functionality.



**9. Licenses.** Subject to your compliance with the terms of this User Agreement, Wizards hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable limited license to use the Game, Software, Game Service, Digital Objects and Game related products or services for your personal use via your Accounts for the sole purpose of playing the Game.

Wizards does not recognize any purported transfers or sales of Digital Objects, event tickets or other virtual assets outside of the Software. Accordingly, you are strictly prohibited from selling, gifting (except as permitted herein) or exchanging Digital Objects, event tickets or other virtual Game items for currency or other value outside of the Game.



Moreover, Wizards does not recognize or sanction player created events in the Game Service and is not liable for any issues that may occur during such an event including, without limitation, entry requirements, match disputes and arbitration, or prize fulfillment.
