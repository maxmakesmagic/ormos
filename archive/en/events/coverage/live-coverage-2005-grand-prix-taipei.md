Live Coverage of 2005 Grand Prix Taipei!
========================================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gptai05/win.jpg)Three Grand Prix, one Pro Tour, and one Continental Championships. Five events where Osamu Fujita had butted up against the glass ceiling of the final match.


He finally shattered that barrier with a rogue deck of his own creation. Deck-X is a blue-white legend deck that was designed to have an advantaged match-up against the ubiquitous [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) deck. He had the chance to play against his best match-up twice in the Top 8 and he took advantage of both opportunities. In the finals he dispatched Masahiko Morita by locking the perennial Top 8 competitor's mana down with Yosei and nailing it down with [Hokori, Dust Drinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hokori%2C+Dust+Drinker).


Deck-X is sure to be a popular choice for the remaining weeks of this Pro Tour Qualifier season but be warned; Osamu says the deck's worst match-ups are White Weenie and Black Hand.
