One of the best parts of the Grand Prix circuit is that it brings us to beautiful places all over the world. The *Magic* competition is great by itself, but visiting new countries and seeing wonderful sights is a sweet bonus. With the mantra of "Play the Game, See the World" in my mind, I set out to made the most of my visit to South America.


The Iguazu Falls (also spelled Iguazú, Iguassu, or Iguaçu) are one of the biggest waterfalls in the world, and I had always wanted to see them. They are located on the border of Brazil and Argentina–a ninety-minute flight away from São Paulo–but since my ticket from Amsterdam to São Paulo stipulated a minimum stay of 7 nights, I had enough days to add a return flight to Iguazu to my itinerary. Fellow coverage reporter Chapman Sim joined in, and off we went!

The Iguazu Falls area stretches along an edge of several kilometers and is divided into 275 separate falls, depending on water level and counting method. There are numerous walkways allowing for spectacular vistas.

The Iguazu Falls were truly an impressive sight and rank among the top natural wonders that I've seen in my life. But what does all of this have to do with Standard? Well, as it turns out, Dragonlords enjoy waterfalls as well. We found this winged friend soaring over the falls:

Whatever else the tournament has in store for us, Chapman and I can safely say we've made the most of the trip. Hopefully, next time, you can too!
