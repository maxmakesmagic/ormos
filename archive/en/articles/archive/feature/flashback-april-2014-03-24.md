April is going to be a treat for Flashback Draft fans, as we'll be offering opportunities to revisit some great **Magic**  block favorites. 

Flashback Drafts give players a chance to draft sets of the past and earn booster packs from those sets. Alongside [the next Cube](/en/articles/archive/cubes-abound-magic-online-championship-and-magic-online-cube-march-2014-03-03), which runs March 19 to April 2, we have Flashback Drafts of the *Mirage*  Block (March 19-26) and *Scars of Mirrodin*  Block (March 26-April 2). Then, following the downtime on Wednesday, April 2, we'll keep the flashback fun going with rotating weekly Block Draft events of both the Swiss and single-elimination varieties. 

Top players in the events get a little extra: The best of the best earn QPs for the [April MOCS season](http://wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/110413/mocs2014#promos); get 15 QPs and you'll earn a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) promo card! 

Without further ado, here are April's Flashback Drafts!
