Welcome to the Great Designer Search 2 Multiple-Choice Test! If you submitted essays for Round 1 of the Search and received an email from the Great Designer Search with this link, you're eligible to take this test.


For each of the 50 questions, there is a single "best" answer that the test is looking for. Please read each question carefully, as different questions are asking for different things. In particular, be aware of the modifier whether the question is looking for the "most" or the "least" of something. Also, this test is based upon modern design standards. The test is focused on what we would currently do, not necessarily what we have done in the distant past.


For each sample card, some information, such as mana cost, is omitted. Some questions contain links to additional information. In most browsers, these links will open in a new window so you don't lose your work.

 a) common  
 b) uncommon

**23) Assuming this card is for an artifact block, what is the *most* significant reason this card wouldn't be turned into an artifact creature?**


 a) Its ability couldn't be activated on the turn it was cast.  
 b) As artifact blocks tend to use +1/+1 or -1/-1 counters, to avoid confusion between different kinds of counters, we normally don't put charge counters on creatures.  
 c) It's much easier to untap creatures and thus much easier to activate the ability more than once during the same turn.  
 d) It's much easier to return creatures to their owner's hand and thus it would be too easy to "refill" the counters.  
 e) Artifact blocks like to play up the tropes of artifacts and "millstones" are a popular artifact trope.


**24) A player loses the game when he or she draws a card with no cards left in his or her library. What's the *most* important reason for this rule?**

**Question 47 refers to the following card:**

> 
>  Enchantment  
> 
>  Whenever a creature is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, put a 2/2 black Vampire creature token onto the battlefield tapped.
> 
> 
> 


**47) What change is Design *most* likely to be make?**


 a) Change "creature" to "nontoken creature."  
 b) Change "the battlefield" to "anywhere."  
 c) Change 2/2 to 1/1.  
 d) Change "Vampire" to "Zombie."  
 e) Remove "tapped."


**48) One of R&D's ongoing concerns is board complexity. We've coined the term "virtual vanilla" to refer to a creature that, after the first turn it enters the battlefield, functions as a simple vanilla creature for purposes of evaluating the board state. (Avoid getting hung up on obscure combinations of cards that *could* make the card not function as a vanilla.)**


**Here are ten creatures:**



> 
> * **[Æther Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept)**
> * **[Ambassador Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambassador+Oak)**

> * **[King Cheetah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=King+Cheetah)**
> * **[Riptide Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Crab)**
