One of the topics discussed among players at this Grand Prix was of course the upcoming release of *Eternal Masters*, the full list of which was [published yesterday](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/eternal-masters). We asked a few of the more notable players in attendance at Grand Prix Manchester for their favorite cards in the set …

**Patrick Dickmann, Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* semifinalist:** All of the cards you couldn't get a premium version of other than maybe some promo until now. So [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach), and a lot more.

**Christoffer Larsen, three-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor:** Let me take a look at that card list … Ooo, I always loved [Second Thoughts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts) in Limited. And [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder). Common [Avarax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avarax)? This is going to be awesome. [Sylvan Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Might) as a common! This set has all the best Limited cards from the ages. The draft format looks great!

**Petr Sochůrek, champion of Grand Prix Paris 2016:** [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)!

**Joel Larsson, champion of Pro Tour *Magic Origins*:** [Arcanis the Omnipotent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcanis+the+Omnipotent). Because he is omnipotent.

**Craig Jones, finalist at Pro Tour Honolulu 2006:** I'm quite excited for [Gamble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gamble) and [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack). [Gamble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gamble) is good for Lands which is the most fun deck in Legacy and [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack) is just the most fun card.
