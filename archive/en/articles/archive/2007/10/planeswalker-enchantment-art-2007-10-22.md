The *Planeshift* set featured a cycle of rare global enchantments with "Planeswalker" in their name. They're capable of generating repeating effects based on the contents of another player's (another planeswalker's) hand. Each card in the cycle featured a different planeswalker from the **Magic** storyline in its art.


### White: Planeswalker's Mirth


The white enchantment in the cycle shows Commodore Guff chuckling his way through a lifegain effect.
