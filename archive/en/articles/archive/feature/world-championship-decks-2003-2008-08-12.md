### Collector's Highlights


2003 marked the Tenth Anniversary of the **Magic: The Gathering** trading card game and the introduction of the *Eighth Edition* Core Set. As part of celebrating a decade of **Magic**, all cards from the *Eighth Edition* Core Set forward have a brand new card face. For this special Worlds tournament, *Eighth Edition* cards were allowed into the Standard Constructed format faster than normal, giving players a chance to use them for the first time in the biggest **Magic** event of the year.

Since *Eighth Edition* cards were the only ones at Worlds to have the new card face, the cards in the World Championship Decks for 2003 got some special treatment. Every card in these decks--including those from sets before *Eighth Edition* have the new card face. Unless these cards are reprinted in later sets, you'll never see them like this again.




### Game Features


We gathered four of the best decks from the 2003 World Championships held in Berlin, Germany. Each of these decks was constructed by a Pro Tour player for the Standard Constructed envrionment at the time, which included the *Odyssey* and *Onslaught* blocks and the brand-new *Eighth Edition* Core Set. Each deck features a 60 card main deck, 15 card sideboard, 12 proxy cards along with a decklist, and factsheet. These cards are gold bordered and feature the 2003 World Championship Deck backing.
