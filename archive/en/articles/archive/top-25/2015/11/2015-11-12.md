Hello everyone, and welcome to our weekly look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. The scene this past weekend was Tacoma, just outside Seattle, Washington, and the format was Legacy. That isn't a format that always sees the pros shine, since it tends to favor players who have spent many months, and often years, tuning their chosen deck archetype inside and out. Tacoma was not the exception that proved the rule, since none of our Top 25 were in elimination-round action come Sunday night in the Top 8.


Nonetheless, eleven of the 25 made the trip to the Pacific Northwest in search of points. In the battle for the No. 1 spot, Owen Turtenwald narrowly missed out on making Day Two, while Seth Manfield came closest of our ranked players to making the Top 8, finishing in nineteenth place. That cements his position as world No. 1, with a handy 4-point lead over Turtenwald. There were positive noises coming from the Eric Froehlich camp pre-event, and although he didn't make the Top 8 (which would have been a fantastic achievement in a field of 2,000), his 27th-place finish justified that optimism. Froehlich moves up one to No. 3, passing Paul Rietzl, who wasn't in action in Tacoma.


Ranks five through ten remain unaltered, with Sam Black (No. 6) failing to make Day Two and Jacob Wilson (No. 8) playing on Day Two but without Pro Points to show for it. Shahar Shenhar joins Antonio Del Moral León in a tie for No. 10, thanks to a solid Day Two performance that saw him pass both Brad Nelson and Yuuya Watanabe. The week's biggest climber was Reid Duke. His 39th-place finish takes him to No. 14, up four from last week. The other player to make progress was Ari Lax, up three at No. 21.


There's just enough time left to tell you about one more Pro Tour Champion: Craig Wescoe, whose Pro Point finish in Tacoma brings him back into the Top 25, with the chance to build some momentum in Atlanta and Pittsburgh in the coming weeks. Meanwhile in Europe, Brussels hosts the next European Grand Prix this coming weekend, and Standard will be the format. To see what all the action does to the rankings, join us right here, seven days from now, at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
