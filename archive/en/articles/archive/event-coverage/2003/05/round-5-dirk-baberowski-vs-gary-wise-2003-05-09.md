Unsurprisingly, the topic of discussion as he and Gary Wise sat down to their Feature Match was the draft itself. He and Wise had sat next to one another, and they shared vague stories about the difficulties they encountered. Through some shrewd deductions Wise got a sense of how bad things were for Baberowski

"How many colors are you playing?" – Gary Wise

Baberowski just smiled.

### Game 1

They shuffled up and got down to business. Baberowski's cautious decision to keep his hand seemed unjustified when he came down with [Deftblade Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deftblade+Elite) on the first turn. Wise answered with [Withered Wretch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch). Baberowski looked like he almost felt bad about slapping down mountain and [Crown of Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Fury). Next door, Kai Budde couldn't help but voice his appreciation in the form of a spit take.

That did little to ease Wise's pain. He played no creatures until turn five while Baberowski threw down [Gustcloak Harrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier) and [Keeneye Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeneye+Aven). Wise made a [Severed Legion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) and a [Shepherd of Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shepherd+of+Rot), but Baberowski knew all about resolving first strike damage before turning on the Elite, so the game was never really in doubt. [Anurid Murkdiver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Murkdiver) stopped the Elite, but Baberowski's fliers took care of the rest.

Baberowski 1 – Wise 0

"That was a fast one, Gary." – Kai Budde

Wise grimaced.

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a910.jpg)Wise got on the board early with [Shepherd of Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shepherd+of+Rot) and a once-amplified [Embalmed Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embalmed+Brawler). Baberowski answered with a morph and then a [Daru Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Stinger) showing three soldiers. Wise got in the beats while he could, adding a [Smokespew Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokespew+Invoker) to the table, but his frustration was evident. Having only one swamp was not helping matters.

Baberowski added injury to insult with [Lavamancer's Skill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill) on his Morph, shooting down the Invoker and paving the way for his Stinger to attack. When Wise activated his Shepherd at end of turn, Baberowski flipped [Echo Tracer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echo+Tracer) to send the Brawler home. Wise, holding [Infest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest), prayed for a swamp. He did not get it.

Now Baberowski was firmly in control. His Stinger was too much for Wise to handle. [Crude Rampart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crude+Rampart) locked up the ground and he just served for four while Wise failed to draw relevant cards.

**Final Result:** Dirk Baberowski defeats Gary Wise 2-0
