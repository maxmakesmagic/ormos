Grand Prix Turin 2012
---------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gptur12/Antonino%20De%20Rosa%20Grand%20Prix%20Turin%20Champion%20v4.jpg)It has been a fantastic weekend of **Magic** here in Turin, not to mention a weekend of fantastic **Magic**. 1,068 players showed up for the last Modern event of the season. The field was whittled down to just 174 competitors on day 2, then to eight for the final rounds. In a Top 8 filled half with Italian names, one obviously stood out. None other than former US national champion and first-class pro Antonino De Rosa chose this Grand Prix to come out of retirement and to revive his **Magic** career. He was one of the first players to secure a Top 8 berth, he then quickly dispatched Marco Cammiluzzi in the quarterfinals to qualify for Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored*, and continued winning, beating Jose Luis Vel√°zquez in the semis. There he met Germany's Michael Thiel, who had swept the Top 8 so far. But De Rosa was not to be denied. In a brutal match Thiel's [Soul Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden) s were just no match for De Rosa's [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) s.


As for the decks we've seen throughout the tournament, Modern proved to be as diverse as ever, albeit with a few clear frontrunners. [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) , Storm, and RUG [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) each put two players in the Top 8, with Delver taking the title. But one of the stories early on day 2 was actually the resurgence of Jund and Affinity. And Soul Sisters, a deck basically no one had on his radar, made it all the way to the finals, proving once again that Modern still is full of surprises.


Congratulations to Antonino De Rosa, champion of Grand Prix Turin 2012!
