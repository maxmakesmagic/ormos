Even though we've been talking about *Judgment* lately, this edition of Sketches is going back to the face of *Torment*,[Chainer, Dementia Master](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%2C+Dementia+Master). Chainer was drawn by Mark Zug.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This card should show the character Chainer in a very insane pose."

It is arguable how "insane" the pose that Mark depicted is.

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Mark. The picture is larger than the one on the card because it was also used for the cover of the *Chainer's Torment* novel.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final piece. This is the uncropped book cover art.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today.
