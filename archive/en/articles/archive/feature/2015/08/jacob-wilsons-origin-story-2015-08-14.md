 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 





Twenty-year-old Jacob Wilson represents one of three competitors playing in this year's World Championship that is younger than the game of *Magic* itself. However, in the short time that Wilson has entrenched himself into the game's highest level of play, he has already garnered a resume and reputation as one of *Magic*'s fiercest and most skilled players.


 


Originally from the bay area but now living in Vancouver, Wilson currently treats *Magic* as a profession. He secured Platinum status in the Pro Tour Players Club for the second season in a row and regularly provides content to ChannelFireball. The 2015 World Championship will be Wilson's second time competing on *Magic*'s greatest stage.

While Wilson's time on the Pro Tour has been light, *Magic* has been part of his life since a very early age.


 


"I played a long time ago with my family, casually with kitchen table rules," Wilson remembered.  



 


It wasn't longer before Wilson found himself in pursuit of an invitation to compete on the Pro Tour, and at just sixteen years old, he found himself among the world's best.


 


"I qualified for Pro Tour Philadelphia 2011 based on rating," Wilson recollected. "I remember eagerly checking the website on a Wednesday to discover my rating of 2093, which was 62nd in the world at the time. Rating-based invites did not award flights, so I had to get my first ever job to pay for my trip."


 


Wilson paid his own way to compete at Pro Tour Philadelphia, and the first Pro Tour opened him up to a whole new level that he needed to explore.


 


"My first Pro Tour was quite disappointing," Wilson recalled. "It is difficult to have a well-positioned Constructed deck, prepare for a new Limited format, and stay focused during each match. My poor performance at the Pro Tour taught me that I had an incredible amount to learn about the game before I could truly compete on the Pro Tour."


 


Less than three years later, at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*, Wilson would find himself battling for the title of Pro Tour champion in Valencia, Spain. While the title ultimately eluded him, it was the start of a career that Wilson isn't even close to completing, and already the young *Magic* player boasts two Pro Tour Top 8s.


 


With Wilson taking a break from his studies to focus more on *Magic*, the fire to win has never burned brighter within him. The World Championship is one of many more events where Wilson will have his chance at a big title.


 


*The 2015* Magic: The Gathering *World Championship takes place in Seattle, Washington, during PAX Prime on August 27, 28, and 30.
