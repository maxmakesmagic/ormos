Before joining Magic Online as its digital product manager, Mike worked as a producer for Wizards's technology department, a product manager for organized play, and as an R&D lead developer. He has played Magic Online since it came out in 2002 and Magic since The Dark. 






The Sunday stage was new territory for both of these players. Chih-Hsiang Chang brought a Red Deck Wins deck and took it to a 12-4 finish in the Swiss. That was good enough to make him the first player from Taiwan to make it to the Top 8. ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptla05/q_mcdanielchang.jpg)*McDaniel, left, and Chang were making their Pro Tour Top 8 debuts in Los Angeles.*


Chris McDaniel has earned the nickname "Star Wars Kid" early in his Magic career. His success this weekend was an example of how mastery of one deck can pay off in a format where so few people have experience. He piloted his Blue-Green [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) deck to a third-place finish in the Swiss but now he will have to try to overcome [Pyrostatic Pillar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrostatic+Pillar) in a best-of-five matchup to advance to the semifinals.


### Game 1


Chang went second and laid a [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer). On McDaniel's second turn, he had a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder).


Chang just passed on his second turn as the [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) held back the Lavamancer. Chris used the opportunity to play a [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) and build up to four mana. During Chris's end step Chang fetched a [Sacred Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry) and used [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) to deal the first opponent-afflicted damage of the game, aiming the Helix directly at Chris.


Chang then took down one of Chris's [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s with [Pillage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage). He must have felt his best chance to win was by denying Chris the mana to be able to go off. Chris didn't appear worried as his [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) continued to hang out on the table to stop [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer).


Chris played a fourth land and cast [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) and then passed the turn. With his life still at 17, it would take a lot of burn to finish him off. Chang killed the [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) with a [Frostling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostling). Chris fetched an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) but Chang had a second [Pillage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage) to leave Chris with one [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and three [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s.



![grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grim+Lavamancer)

[Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) knocked Chris down to 16. Chris just passed on his turn. Either he wasn't worried or he had no more business spells. Chris played an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and once again did nothing. Now Chang threw two [Char](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Char)s to put Chris at 7. A [Slith Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Firewalker) came across but Chris used a [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to stay at 7.


Chris cast a second [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), followed by a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). Chang responded with [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), [Lava Dart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Dart) and [Barbarian Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Ring) to place Chris at 2. Finally, Chris fetched a [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). The Fact revealed [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven), two [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s and a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest).


Chang split the piles, [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) with the [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s or Minds Desire/[Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). Chris took the pile with the Gifts. With the three mana floating, he played an [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) followed by a [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven).


Since Chris was on just 2 life the Lavamancer was still a real threat. Even if Chris managed a huge [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze), Chang would be able to untap and use the Lavamancer during the upkeep to kill Chris. He would need to remove the Lavamancer from the board along with the combo kill.


[Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) revealed [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), [Revive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revive), [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) and [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams). Chang let Chris have the [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and a [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire). Chris cast a [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), which Change split as [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) or [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest), and double [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest).



![Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mind%27s+Desire)

Chris took the bigger pile. He cast a third [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), two [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s, and then [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) to untap all of his lands. He recast a [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) out of his graveyard to get the Storm count up to 13 for his [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire).


The [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) revealed another [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) along with a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) for the instant kill. But would Chris worry about a second [Lava Dart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Dart)? There was already one in Chang's graveyard.


Chris played a [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) for [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze), [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) and two land. Chang gave him the land but that would allow Chris to [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams) for five returning [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze), two [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams) and [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest).


Chang didn't know how to stack [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze). Instead he let all of the [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze) copies resolve before trying to [Lava Dart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Dart). If he would have only let some of the copies resolve, Chris wouldn't have been able to respond with a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for [Words of Wisdom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Words+of+Wisdom) although he could have gotten a [Memory Lapse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse) in any case.


Instead, [Words of Wisdom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Words+of+Wisdom) in response to the [Lava Dart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Dart) killed Chang and ended Game 1.


McDaniel 1, Chang 0


### Game 2


Chang led with a second-turn [Pyrostatic Pillar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrostatic+Pillar). Chris had a [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) but that knocked his life total to 18. Chang went down to 18 to play out a [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer). He also played a [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) for additional beats. Chris played a [Revive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revive) (down to 16) to bring back the [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth). Chang did two damage to both players with a [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet). He left both cards on top. The first was a [Pillage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage) to hit Chris's only [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). Chris took one from the Lavamancer and two more from his own [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth), going down to 11.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptla05/q_chang.jpg)*Chang bounced back with a bounty of burn.*
Chang sacrificed a [Wooded Foothills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Foothills) for his fourth land. The Nexus animated and attacked for one. Chris was stuck on three land and was visibly upset. After a good deal of thought, Chris passed the turn. [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) knocked him to 8.


Chang drew a [Bloodstained Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire) to fuel his Lavamancer and threw a [Char](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Char) at Chris. Chris drew a card and conceded. The damage output from Chang was too great.


Chris 1, Chang 1


### Game 3


After Chris laid a land, Chang wasted no time in throwing a [Firebolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) to the head. Chris played a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and sacrificed it while Chang did nothing on his second turn. Chris sacrificed the [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and played a land to get four into play. During Chris's end step he was hit with a [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet). Once again Chang left both cards on top.


In response to a [Pillage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage) on his lone [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), Chris played a [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) for [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams), [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), Nostalgic Dream and [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). Chang decided to give Chris [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) and an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island).



![Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nostalgic+Dreams)

Chris played the [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), the [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) and a [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams) for three, returning [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams), [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) and an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). He was tapped out after this and passed the turn.


Chang had eight mana available, thanks to the [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring). He wasted no time in swinging with a [Slith Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Firewalker) and hitting two of Chris's lands with land destruction spells.


During Chang's next upkeep he cast a [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) to put Chris at 13. Once again he kept both cards. The first was a [Disenchant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant) that was aimed right at the [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring).


Chris responded with a [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) for [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) and a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). Chang gave him both mana cards. Chris also cast a [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) before the [Disenchant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant) resolved.


Chris played both the [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and the [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) to build himself back up to six lands on the table. Well, it was six lands after a [Barbarian Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Ring) cleared the [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and let the [Slith Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Firewalker) build up to a 3/3. Chang then played a [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer).


Chris was still at 11 life but it was getting close to the time where he would need to go off. Chris discarded his hand to a [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams) to retrieve a [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) and a [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) (his hand was [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest), land).


Chang hit for three with the Slith to put Chris on 8. Chris used the newly fetched Gifts to give Chang the choice between [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams), [Revive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revive), [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire). Chang decided to give Chris [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) and [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish).



![Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Moment%27s+Peace)

Chris played down a [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) and cast a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest). He then played the [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest), untapping all six of his lands. A [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) here would be only for a measly four cards. He went all-in as he cast a [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to drive the storm count up to four. That plus the Desire would reveal five cards. He would need a strong set of cards for five.


Chang could feel the win closing in as he gave a hearty chuckle. The second card revealed was a [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) and the fourth card was an [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) to give Chris a chance. The other three cards were all land. [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) fetched [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), and [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). Chang gave Chris the [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) and a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish).


Chris cast [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) again. This time he went for [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams)[Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), and [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Chang chose for the [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) to be put into Chris's hand.


Chris targeted Chang with a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and responded with a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze), then he [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish)ed for a second [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze). Chang didn't have enough library left or enough damage potential and conceded.


Chris 2, Chang 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptla05/q_mcdaniel.jpg)*McDaniel's Desire deck required plenty of math to track mana and storm.*
### Game 4


So far the player who had played first won every game of the match. Chang began this game with a [Sacred Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry), with a [Genju of the Spires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genju+of+the+Spires) on it. The next turn he placed out [Pyrostatic Pillar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrostatic+Pillar). Chris took two when he placed out a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). Chang missed his third land drop and managed to only play a [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) and a [Frostling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostling).


Chris played out a second [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), dropping to 16. Chang still didn't find land with his next turn and could only send his [Frostling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostling) into the fray. Chang cupped his hands over his mouth in frustration from his poor land draw.


Chris went up to four mana when he sacrificed a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). He didn't have a land to play, but with four mana open, a blue card-drawing spell couldn't be far behind. On Chang's turn the [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) traded with a [Frostling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostling).


Chang finally had a third land and [Pillage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage)d an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). Chris responded with a [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). Chang gave him [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams), [Revive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revive) and placed [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) and [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) into the graveyard.



![Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Brain+Freeze)

Chris used [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams) to return 3 cards, [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize), [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) while taking 2, 13. He dropped to 11 from replaying the [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder).


Chang used [Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain) to destroy the returned [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and Chris sacrificed his [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) to fetch another [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island).


Chris cast a [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) and an [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) to begin his turn. He then used [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) to destroy [Pyrostatic Pillar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrostatic+Pillar). Chris floated a lot of mana and cast a second [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest). With all of that mana floating, Chris cast a [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) for five. Once again Chris would need to rely on his deck to help him out.


The Desire showed three [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction)s, a [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth), and an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). The first [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) effectively ended the game when it revealed a [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire). Chris now just needed to build up an even higher storm count before ending the game with the [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze) combo, and the path to the semifinals was set for McDaniel.
