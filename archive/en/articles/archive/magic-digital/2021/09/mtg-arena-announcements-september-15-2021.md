Stabilization Progress
======================


The team has made progress on improving stability and eliminating bugs following the update.


Thursday’s (September 16) update will bring a few notable fixes::


* Fix for a bug that caused some players ranking up to Mythic in Limited to enter a bad state where their rank was listed as "Beginner." Players will no longer enter this state after the update.  
  

 We're hopeful that this also fixes the issue for players already in this state, but this is a very unusual bug that the team has struggled with. If it doesn't, be assured we will continue to aggressively look for a solution.
* Fix for a bug that prevented Commander weighting from working properly in Brawl and Historic Brawl.
* Fix for a bug where the Welcome Bundle was not granting the proper mix of packs. We have done a mass grant to give players affected the proper packs.
* Fix for a bug that caused players not to receive quest progress from direct/friendly challenges (for real this time).

We're continuing work on remaining issues to make sure you have a great experience.

State of the Game: Werewolves and Hatching Green Eggs
=====================================================


[The latest State of the Game article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-innistrad-midnight-hunt-2021-09-14) is out with a look ahead at the MTG Arena release of *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* this Thursday—plus screenshots!


We also talk about the imminent rotation and the goodies you’ll get when your glimmering green renewal egg hatches after the update (like the ten rare/mythic rare individual card rewards from Standard 2022 sets!), and more.


Eternal Night Card Styles Available in Deckbuilder
==================================================


The following eternal night card styles will be available in the deckbuilder after the release of *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*:


* Adeline, Resplendent Cathar
* Dennick, Pious Apprentice
* Florian, Voldaren Scion
* Gisa, Glorious Resurrector
* Jadar, Ghoulcaller of Nephalia
* Jerren, Corrupted Bishop
* Lier, Disciple of the Drowned
* Liesa, Forgotten Archangel
* Ludevic, Necrogenius
* Old Stickfingers
* Rem Karolus, Stalwart Slayer
* Sigarda, Champion of Light
* Slogurk, the Overslime
* Vadrik, Astral Archmage

These will also be available in a forthcoming event similar to The Yawning Portal event. The event will be held later in the *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* season, but we are making them available now for those who can't wait to get them. Purchasing these styles will result in the duplicate-protection of the event not awarding them to you as event rewards.


One Month Left for *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons*
=================================================


*Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* runs until October 14, so you have just under a month left to play and grab the new cards it introduces to *MTG Arena*.


If you haven't played yet, *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* offers fun, quick-to-start play with a punch. [Pick from themed packet lists](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/jumpstart-historic-horizons-packet-lists-2021-07-26) to assemble a deck and start playing. Cards included in packets are either new to *MTG Arena* or use existing card versions available, and cards from your chosen packets will be added to your collection.


Entry is 2,000 gold or 400 gems. Each of your first two wins awards a rare or mythic rare individual card reward (ICR) from *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons*.


You can play with a deck as long as you like, and when you're done, you can resign. You can try new packets and decks and earn more ICRs after you resign by paying and rejoining to play again.
