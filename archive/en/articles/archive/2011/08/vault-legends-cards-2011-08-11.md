Hey! Let's quit fooling around here, okay? [*From the Vault: Legends*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/ftvlegends/productinfo) is coming out on August 26. It's going to have fifteen legendary creatures, all in foil. Its MSRP is $34.99. *You* want to know what's going to be in it. *We* have the answers. Let's just do this!


### The Announcement


The all-new illustration for this card was included in our [original announcement](/en/articles/archive/announcing-vault-legends-2011-02-07):

### Enjoy Magic!


If you go to [www.wizards.com/enjoymagic](http://www.wizards.com/enjoymagic) and enter a particular secret code (which you can get in some packs of ***Magic** 2012*), you'll see two wallpapers that give away two more cards.

### The Comic Con Panel


At San Diego Comic Con (or, if you insist, "Comic-Con International") our panel showed three cards:

| *Doran, the Siege Tower* | *Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker* |

### New Cards!


That last card is [Sun Quan, Lord of Wu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Quan%2C+Lord+of+Wu) from the extremely rare set *Portal Three Kingdoms*. This is not only Sun Quan's first appearance in the current card frame, it's his first appearance with black borders! And he's not the only *Portal Three Kingdoms* card to make it into *From the Vault: Legends*....

Cao Cao, Lord of Wei! Exciting!


Now, let's run down most of the rest of the cards, but we'll leave a special surprise for last. Keep an eye out for new art!

### The Final Card


That's only fourteen. The fifteenth card is an *Innistrad* preview! Already, this tells you something about *Innistrad*: it contains at least one legend!
