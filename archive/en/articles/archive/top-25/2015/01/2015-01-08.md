Welcome back to the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings, and the start of 2015. The year started with a bang, featuring a double-header of Grand Prix goodness, so let's jump straight into all the action.



Wherever you were at a GP last weekend, you were playing Standard. In the Philippines, [Manila](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpman15) played host, while [Denver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpden15) saw Standard action in the United States. Lee Shi Tian of Hong Kong may only have moved up one place in the rankings to No. 9, but he was the biggest winner on the weekend, making it as far as the semifinals. The Manila Top 8 was stacked with familiar names, including Christian Calcano, Martin Juza, 2006 World Champion Makihito Mihara, and 2012 World *Magic* Cup winning captain Tzu-Ching Kuo. Falling just short of the Top 8 was No. 2 Ivan Floch, an unexpected visitor to the Asia-Pacific region as the year began. As we'll see, he needed a decent finish just to keep pace with No. 1 Owen Turtenwald, who was plying his trade at Denver. As it was, 24th place sees Floch maintain his 2nd spot, still almost 11 points behind the leader.



As we mentioned, Turtenwald was much closer to home in Denver, where he ran off a series of wins late on Sunday to take him up to 17th. Plenty of ranked players dusted off their holiday rust, and it was no surprise to see Hall of Famer William Jensen make the Top 8 and rise to No. 6 in the rankings, despite another quarterfinal loss. No. 11 Sam Black finished 14th, and there were also solid finishes for No. 3 Shaun McLaren (32nd), No. 21 Tom Martell (41st), and No. 12 Eric Froehlich (42nd). Neither of the World Championship finalists—No. 8 Shahar Shenhar and No. 15 Patrick Chapin—made Day Two, and they weren't alone. No. 16 Josh Utter-Leyton and No. 19 Paul Rietzl also missed out, while poor Alexander Hayne (No. 22) couldn't buy a win and left empty-handed.



This weekend it's another double-header, with Shizuoka playing host to Limited action, while it's Modern taking the spotlight in Omaha. Join us next week for all the news from the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
