M**agic Online** has kicked into high gear as players' mouths water over the impending release of *Conflux* to the digital pantheon. Of course, we here at Decks of the Week have the best jumping off points for building new decks in the world of *Conflux* Standard, Extended, *Shards of Alara* Block, and more. 


First up, Standard lists. Is Five Color Control on top? Or have players started playing Faeries for fear the blue menace will soon be put out by cards like [Volcanic Fallout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout) and [Scattershot Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scattershot+Archer)? Of course, there's always room for innovation. With an Aggro Bant deck taking home the blue envelope in a recent Extended PTQ for Honolulu, there's no doubt the second set in the *Shards of Alara* block will bring plenty of format-altering cards and interactions to the world of Standard.


Then of course we have Extended and *Shards of Alara* Block lists to discuss. Find out what's winning in the online world of **Magic** Extended, then use the technology to take home the top slot at your upcoming Pro Tour Qualifier for Honolulu. Or, take a look at what the *Shards of Alara* Block format looks like before *Conflux* hits!


Speaking of which, **Magic Online** isn't the only world where tournaments are heating up! The Pro Tour Qualifier-Honolulu season has kicked into high gear, and we'll have a super showing of decklists in the next installation of Decks of the Week, including those from the Game in the Gulf **Magic** Cruise! In the meanwhile, you can find out where the next PTQ located near you is [with this link](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/honolulu09-qualifiers).
