We've secretly transmogrified the Day 2 standings at an undetermined point Saturday, exchanging player names with their deck archetypes. Here's a look at how the decks stack up.


 




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Deck** | **Played on Day 1** | **Played on Day 2** | **% from Day 1 to advance** |
| Reanimator | 31 | 16 | 51.60% |
| Goblins | 55 | 16 | 29.00% |
| Rock | 61 | 12 | 19.60% |

| Madness | 15 | 8 | 53.30% |
| Red Deck Wins | 27 | 7 | 25.90% |
| Affinity | 8 | 5 | 62.50% |
| Aluren | 9 | 5 | 55.50% |
| Mind’s Desire | 10 | 5 | 50.00% |
| Cephalid Breakfast | 6 | 4 | 66.60% |
| White Weenie | 8 | 3 | 37.50% |
| Scepter Control | 4 | 2 | 50.00% |

| Elf and Nail | 1 | 1 | 100.00% |
| Life | 1 | 1 | 100.00% |

Here are the archetypes of Day 2, broken out by the number still playing Saturday, the number played yesterday and Day 2 penetration percentage.


The big story is obviously the remarkable penetration of Reanimator and combo Reanimator decks. Of the thirty-one Reanimator decks that were played yesterday, better than 50 percent of them made it through to Day 2. There were 16 players Exhuming Akroma's when play began this morning. Akroma or [Rorix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix) have both been in play on turn one in this tournament with a little help from a Mox.


Cephalid Breakfast is a combo deck that replaces the banned [Hermit Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermit+Druid) from Angry Ghoul with Cephalid [Illusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusion)ist and Nomads En-Kor. The En-Kor targets the [Illusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusion)ist and mills the player's entire deck away. The player then uses flashback on a [Krosan Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation) to ensure that they draw [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) or [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) and return a [Sutured Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sutured+Ghoul) with the stench of Dragon's Breath and swing for lethal damage. There were six players at the helm of the freshly minted deck and four of them made it through to today's action


All totaled better than 20 percent of the Day 2 field is playing some kind of Reanimator deck.


The biggest deck on Day 1 was The Rock with just over sixty players piloting the green-black staple of the Extended format. Just over 20 percent of the Day 1 Rock decks advanced with only twelve players of the sixty-one making playing on Saturday. Rock makes up just over 12 percent of the Saturday field after taking up a 21 percent chunk on Day 1.


Goblins in all of it stripes was the next most played deck yesterday with 55. Led by their [Goblin Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief)s, 16 of them advanced through to do battle Saturday. Goblins made up 18 percent of the Day 1 field and are a hair over 16 percent of the field Saturday. That means almost a third of the Goblin decks from Day 1 are still playing.


Half of the [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) players made it through, with five of the 10 still going. Madness posted similar percentages with eight of 15 Day 1 players making the cut. The same is true of [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) with five of nine still going. Affinity put through five of eight.


Red Deck wins put a hair over 25 percent of its Day 1 advocates through to champion it Saturday. There were 27 players yesterday and seven were still trying to live up to the deck's demanding title come round 9.
