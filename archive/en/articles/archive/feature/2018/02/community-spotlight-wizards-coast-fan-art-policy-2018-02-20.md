Did you know that Wizards of the Coast has a [Fan Art Policy](http://company.wizards.com/fancontentpolicy)? And that that policy is aimed at letting our fans enjoy and celebrate *Magic* with their myriad talents?


Our goal with this policy? Well, I'll let the law mages who put this together say it:


*We love that you enjoy creating and sharing fan content (that's the stuff you make) and we want to encourage you to continue to create and share your stuff!* 


Pretty simple, right?


The policy has been live for a few months now, so why are we highlighting it? Glad you asked, me!


*Dominaria* is coming up, and we know fans have a close connection with Dominaria, the characters, and basically everything about the world we're about to revisit. And we want to encourage fans to explore that through art! In fact, we plan to find ways to share your art with a wider audience when the time comes.


So read through the [Fan Art Policy](http://company.wizards.com/fancontentpolicy) and share your talents!
