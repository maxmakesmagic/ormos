"Yo, you a net-decker?" Kyle Sanchez snarked at his opponent. He may have been away from **Magic** for a while, but he still knew how to toy with an opponent.


"Maybe," a meeker Orrin Beasley replied.


"I tell ya, man, there's no pride in **Magic** anymore." Kyle shook his head disdainfully and shuffled his cards. His unique mill deck had been taking down some unlikely contenders so far, and we'll see how it fairs against Beasley's CawBlade. Sanchez said in his testing with Pro Tour—Hollywood winner Charles Gindy, this match was 80% in his favor. 80% seems pretty darn good. Those are close to Owling Mine numbers, I think.


But it's time for Kyle Sanchez to put his money where his mouth is.


### Game One


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Preordain)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)
Sanchez started off with an Island into a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), yielding a nice turn-two [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and a turn-three pre-fetchland [Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab). However, the Crab was promptly [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) ed by Beasley, who spent his own first turns [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) ing and keeping mana up for said counterspell things. [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment), [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) and a Sword of Feast and Famine lay waiting in Beasley's hand.


Turn four Sanchez had up 2 Islands, a Forest and a Mountain, and thanks to [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra), cast [Archive Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archive+Trap) on his opponent.


"A couple Swords and a Hawk. Not bad." Kyle mused.


Beasley's [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) in-hand came down and searched two buddies, then Beasley laid the Horror artifact creature.


Sanchez cycled a [Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions) from Beyond (rather than [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall)ing with it), revealing his desperation, then laid a [Jace, Memory Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept), drew a card while casting a free [Glimpse the Unthinkable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Unthinkable), then shipped his turn. Sword of Feast and Famine came down, equipped, then aided Beasley's attack to make the totals 17-16 in Sanchez's favor. Post-combat, Beasley O-Ring'ed away the opposing Planeswalker. Sanchez had some tricks to foil the Sworded-up bird, but totals still became 9-14. And single digits was not good for Sanchez and his milling compatriots.


Facing lethal next turn, as more birds and more Swords cluttered Beasley's side, Sanchez drew, sighed, and scooped up his cards.


**Orrin Beasley 1 – 0 Kyle Sanchez**

### Game Two


Dueling [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)s, and Sanchez followed with a [Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab) and a [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse). Beasley simply held up [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) mana, and caught a second Crab, then swept the O-G Original Crab with an O-B O-blivion Ring.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept)
A turn or two passed before Kyle cast [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) at the end of Beasley's turn to get his [Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab) back in time to have two uncracked fetchlands (an [Scald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scald)ing Tarn and a [Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest) ) in play. After some cracking and some fetching, Beasley got his turn back with 21 cards in his graveyard. He calmly tapped out for a [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), and was caught in an [Archive Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archive+Trap) at the end of his turn. He had 5 cards in his hand, and only 15 cards left in his library.



Two [Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions) from Beyond restocked Sanchez's hand (this time they [Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recall)ed), allowing Sanchez to cast [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), play a Forest and a [Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest) (milling for nine in the process), then two [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra)s and a [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). He bottomed two lands, drew an Island, and passed the turn with a [Jace, Memory Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept) and a third [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) alongside the unwanted blue land.


Gideon was lonely. Sanchez was still at 17 life, and Beasley's library was low. Very low. Jura did what he could. He grabbed a [S](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine)word of Feast and Famine and took Sanchez to single digits, but Sanchez's Jace was more than willing to take Beasley's remaining cards and throw them in the trash.


**Orrin Beasley 1 – 1 Kyle Sanchez**

### Game Three


These early cyclers are getting a bit predictable, but thankfully, Sanchez fought Beasley's [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) with a turn-one [Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab), and Beasley decided a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), searching up for two friends, was a better second-turn play than holding up [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) mana. The library searching allowed Sanchez to [Archive Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archive+Trap) for free. This was important because after a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), Sanchez's hand was merely four lands and another [Archive Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archive+Trap). If his [Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab) bit the dust, he might have some trouble on his hands.


It was about to do just that to a [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) the following turn, but Sanchez had drawn an [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil), like a curly-haired boss, to save it. Beasley's board was three Hawks, and he was able to [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) Kyle's re-cast [Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab). Sanchez was ok with that though; he had another one sitting in his hand, again, like the aforementioned boss.


Sanchez knew how to play this deck. Every time I got up to count the cards in Beasley's graveyard, he would say the number immediately when I put the deck down.


"25?" he asked. I nodded.


Sanchez's various [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)s and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s found him more Crabs. One was [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) -ed while a [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) joined the 1/1 Hawks. Sanchez sunk to 9, milled his opponent with his remaining Crab, then cracked fetchlands to mill some more.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Archive+Trap)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archive+Trap)
"You should have 10 cards in your library?"


"11."


"Ok. Hm. How many Spell Pierces are in your 'yard?" He silently counted them up. It was clear Sanchez had a plan.


"On your upkeep, Archive Trap ?" Ah yes, *that* plan.


Beasley thought for a moment, then scooped up his cards. It looks like that 80% win rate might not be too skewed after all.


**Kyle Sanchez 2 – 1 Orrin Beasley**


Kyle Sanchez's deck has some really neat tricks up its sleeve, and some that he requested I not reveal this early in the tournament. Stay turned for more on this surprising little deck.
