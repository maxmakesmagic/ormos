It's time for Pro Tour San Juan! And that means it's also time for what amounts to a big **Magic** convention *in* San Juan, because in addition to the Main Event, there's going to be public events of every size, shape, and description as well as artist signings, R&D members and pro players playing *Archenemy* against eager civilians, and ever so much more!
