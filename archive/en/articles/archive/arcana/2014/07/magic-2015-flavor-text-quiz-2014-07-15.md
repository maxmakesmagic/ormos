*Magic 2015* is barely out the door and already the various internets can't stop talking about it. In fact, it's so barely out the door it's not even officially out there yet, but already you can read reviews, new deck ideas, crazy combos (how about that [Chain Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383412)?), and limited how-tos.


But while you're furiously preparing for the official release this Friday, you might not have had enough time to pore over the flavor text just yet. *Magic* fans are an insatiable bunch, but even the most meticulous among you probably haven't memorized each bit of flavor text just yet.


Does that sound like a challenge? Good. It is.


Take this eight-question quiz below and test your *Magic 2015* flavor-text knowledge.
