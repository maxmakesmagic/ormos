 Grand Prix Toronto champion Ari Lax came to the feature match area and asked the Judge Riki Hayashi an interesting question. "Can I have a copy of my decklist, please? I don't know where mine went." Lax looked at his opponent Thiago Saporito, one of the most known and feared players on *Magic Online*, and then said, "After that last match, I'm going to need some help sideboarding."




 Lax was referring to the already infamous card, [Mass Calcify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Calcify), that he had mistakenly sideboarded in during the quarterfinals. "It was the first time in the entire tournament I sided it in, and it was by accident." He added later, "I'm never going to live that down."




 He smiled and looked at Saporito again. "Don't worry, when we go to Game 2, I will make sure [Mass Calcify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Calcify) is not in my deck. It will be face up on the table the entire game."



Lax was doing his standard talk-em-out strategy. Getting the table talking was how he felt the most comfortable. It kept him on his game, and could also get his opponents off theirs. Saporito was refusing to engage. Coming from the hallowed halls of MTGO, Saporito was used to being silent and stony.


Lax tried once again. "Are you bolov0 online?" Lax asked.


"Yes." Those were the first words Saporito spoke. Then he was silent again.


"Just wondering."


The banter continued from one side of the table, but Saporito was in game-mode already, and this mirror match would be a slog for both players. Saporito had told me earlier that even though there are some different card choices, he believes it will come down to the opening hands and the first turn.


"I already played him in the Swiss." He elaborated no more than that. But we all know what that means.




*Ari Lax, longtime player with his first Pro Tour Top 8, goes up against Thiago "bolov0" Saporito in the Semifinals.*
