Once again, we have two Planeswalker Decks being released with *Hour of Devastation*, this time featuring the visages of Nicol Bolas and Nissa. Should you go looking for one of these decks, these are the two cards you'll see staring back at you from the front.

If you pick up the package featuring Nicol Bolas gracing its cover, you'll get a full deck of Standard-legal cards, including these four cards that are found only in the Planeswalker Deck:
