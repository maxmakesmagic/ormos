"So, how does it feel to be Rookie of the Year?"


Not an easy question to answer beyond the obvious. Jared Boettcher thinks for a moment, and the attention and concentration he shows strikes a jarring contrast with his carefully rumpled outfit, haphazard beard and downright impossible Pokemon toque.


"It's a really big deal. It feels like all my hard work has paid off. Plus the stress of if I'll make it is finally over. It was tough, having to sweat Butakov when he was X-2 in Day 2. He'd needed like a Finals to beat me but he could definitely have done it. Last night I finally got a good sleep."


It's been a long season for Boettcher. He started out aggressively traveling to PTQs, enduring near misses in the Top 8. Finally he had a breakout performance in Grand Prix Washington DC with a Top 8, earning him the coveted invite to Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* in Valencia.


"You know, at D.C. ... I'd been chasing for so long, and then Round 4 after my byes I played Craig Wescoe and he beat me, and I started thinking here we go again, another 0-3 tournament. Then at the end of Day 1 I looked up and I was 8-1 and it just dawned on me that I was really doing it, but I didn't get pumped up or excited I just played it one match at a time."

*Jared Boettcher is presented his Rookie of the Year award at the award ceremony, cementing his good season as well as his seat at the 2014 World Championship.*

The exhilaration and relief didn't last long. In Boettcher's mind, he'd already moved the goalposts. The next goal was putting up a good finish at the Pro Tour to stay qualified. He even won himself a PTQ for Atlanta as a back-up plan, just in case Valencia was a bust. Of course it wasn't. He finished 9th overall. With his foot in the door, he needed more Pro Points to secure status, so he started attending more Grand Prix.



"I think when I finished Top 16 in Atlanta, that's when I really started thinking about Rookie of the Year, that it was possible."


That meant more practice, more travel, more Grand Prix weekends. Success piled on top of success, and Boettcher found himself within reach of Platinum Status. Hitting the 45-point threshold before Pro Tour *Magic 2015* would mean a $3,000 appearance fee. He made it happen. Along the way he started networking, winding up working with Team Day1*Magic*.


"I learned a lot working with different teams, first with my local group, and then with Day1*Magic*. Not just about *Magic*, but also about how different groups have different dynamics, and about what it is I want to get out of testing and how I want to do that. You know, everyone's different. Just because you're a bunch of people working together doesn't mean you're going to be able to work well together. I was talking to Jon Stern from Team Face-to-Face, and he was saying that when there's ten people in the room he feels like a lot less is getting done, that he'd much rather work with a small focused group. I think I'm the same way. I think that the change to all the Pro Tours being Standard helps that. You don't have to try to break a brand new format every time, so a small group can compete."


Boettcher won't be taking a break, either. He's already started sketching out his next trips for the start of the 2014-2015 season. He's also turning inward, trying to find out what he needs to become the best player he can be. "It's like your RPM dial in the car, if you try to just push and push you get into the red and you blow up. You need to bring it up steadily and then you'll find yourself in that next gear. It happened to me learning to just, you know, take it all one game at a time, and now I'm looking for the next thing, trying to grow as a player. One thing I started doing was playing a different deck every tournament, just to try new things, learn new things. In Legacy, at least. In Standard, Mono-Black was just oppressively good, so I played that."


As far as the upcoming World Championship, "I wouldn't say I'm nervous. The competition is going to be hard, a lot harder than a Pro Tour. So, I don't have any expectations for myself as far as finishing goes. I just want to be prepared and play my best *Magic*. It's going to be an incredible experience. You know, that's what it's all about. I'm just going to keep working at it, playing my best, trying to find that next level in myself. I'm not going to go crazy traveling, going to Europe and back just for a Grand Prix, but if there's a tournament within reasonable distance, I'm going to be there."
