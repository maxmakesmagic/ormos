 Bruce's games invariably involve several friends, crazy plays, and many laughs. Bruce believes that if anyone at your table isn't having fun, then you are doing it wrong. 






 The first game of the night had been going pretty well, then Jesse decided things were getting out of hand, so he used Jaya Ballard's third ability, doing 6 damage to all creatures and players. That effectively reset the board, except for your [Wall of Frost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost) and a handy [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top). Harry played another land and dropped a smaller creature that really didn't affect the board in any way. John followed up on his turn with [Deranged Hermit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Hermit) and a flashed back [Chatter of the Squirrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chatter+of+the+Squirrel). By themselves, the Squirrels and the hermit were annoying, but you've seen John's deck before, and [Beastmaster Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension) would be coming in the not-too-distant future. You'd need an answer right away. 

 You could see the writing on the wall. There was little doubt where John's attack would go, since Jesse had no cards in hand, you had the highest life total then, and—with the Top—you were finding answers and threats faster than the others. The problem was that you only had [Phyrexian Metamorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Metamorph) and your [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) already told you there was nothing in the next two cards on top of your library that would save you. You played the Metamorph, copying John's [Deranged Hermit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Hermit). This bought you an extra turn, but you never saw an answer from your deck and got overrun by John's Squirrels, pumped by the [Beastmaster Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension) you knew was coming. 

You shake your head in disgust as you realize John and his stupid Squirrels have taken you out of yet another game! The Fates have not smiled upon you; you have suffered an ignominious death at the hands of those filthy rodents.
