From the R&D whiteboard: *What's the hungriest creature in **Magic**?*


Today we're trying something a little different. The above question first appeared on the infamous R&D whiteboard a few weeks ago. The resulting "discussion" looked like this:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/activity/127_whiteboard.jpg)The bottom of the continuum on the left, by the way, reads "do not feed another wafer-thin mint."


And no, we don't know what a "Goyfatog" is, either.


Below, a few R&D members argue in favor of their chosen creature:

**Monty Ashley:** After careful consideration, I believe that things that are [Ravenous Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ravenous%2BRats) are hungrier than things that are merely [Voracious Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Voracious%2BDragon) or even [Hungry Hungry Heifer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Hungry%2BHungry%2BHeifer). And of the "ravenous" cards, only one is a creature that's also defined by its hunger. I give you [Ravenous Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Vampire), the hungriest creature in **Magic**.

**Mons Johnson:** [Chronatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronatog). It eats time!

**Kelly Digges:** [Worldgorger Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldgorger+Dragon) almost got my vote, but it was pointed out that one can gorge without being hungry. In fact, once [Worldgorger Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldgorger+Dragon) eats everything in sight, it's so stuffed it can't even keep it all down. So [Doomgape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomgape) is my answer, for the reasons listed on the whiteboard.

**Mark Rosewater:** [Fat Ass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fat+Ass): Its hunger is so great it makes any mage summoning it eat.
