So-called "Vanilla" creatures have no abilities—their mechanical identity comes essentially down to their cost, power, and toughness. *Future Sight* hasn't forgotten these loveable Core Set-style monsters, nor will the future of **Magic**. "Vanilla" creatures are great for the game, not just as learning tools and Core Set staples—they make an impact on the board without cluttering the mind, they showcase power/cost ratios across the colors, and they provide vast space for involved flavor text.


They can do something else, too. If you drop that potential for flavor text, they become amazing, broad canvases for full-frame art. Today we take a look at the art of *Future Sight's* ability-free creatures—creatures that are so gorgeous and full of flavor, that "vanilla" doesn't begin to do them justice. *(Click the small images below to see high-resolution art from the cycle.)*
