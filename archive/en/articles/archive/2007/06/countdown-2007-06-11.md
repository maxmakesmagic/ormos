[![Tenth Edition Logo](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/10e_logo_300.jpg)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday&dcmp=ILC-MTGFEAT)It's a big year for **Magic**. The world's first collectable card game is coming up on its fifteenth anniversary, and in the meantime the core set reaches its milestone *Tenth Edition* this summer. To celebrate, *Tenth Edition* has been designed to be a core set that stands out as something special. As you've probably [already heard](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1271), *Tenth Edition* will be printed in black borders, for all languages, something that hasn't happened for English cards since Beta. Further, *Tenth Edition* marks the first core set *ever* [to include legendary cards](/en/node/602066). And, as if all that weren't enough, we're throwing the party of the year with the [1st Annual **Magic** Worldwide Game Day](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday&dcmp=ILC-MTGFEAT) where you'll get the chance to be part of the biggest **Magic** day of the year and pick up a commemorative foil promo of Reya Dawnbringer in the process!


Can't wait? We can't blame you. To help keep you busy in the meantime, we've put together an enormous promotion for the new set. Over the next five weeks we're going to reveal all of the set's new art for you, one batch at a time. Each batch is based on the first letter in each card's name. (The groups are A-D, D-H, H-P, Q-S, and S-Z, but they won't necessarily show up in that order.) The illustrations are numbered, so you'll be able to post your best guesses on the message boards and see how you compared with the rest of the readers. Along the way, every single weekday of those five weeks we'll reveal other new cards on the front page. Those twenty-five cards don't have new art (not counting today's special exception), which means they wouldn't have shown up in the feature articles. So, this way you'll have previews coming both ways. Through it all, we'll use the [*Tenth Edition* product page](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/expansion/tenthedition) to reveal all of the cards in the set officially spoiled so far, so make sure to keep checking back to see what's new.


Have fun, post your thoughts, and we'll see you at **Magic** [Worldwide Game Day](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday&dcmp=ILC-MTGFEAT) on July 14!
