"May the winner of this match win the Pro Tour," Chapin said as the cameras closed in for the opening shot.


"I like it," Utter-Leyton replied with a grin.


Somehow, neither Hall of Famer Patrick Chapin nor reigning Player of the Year and No. 13 Ranked Player Josh Utter-Leyton have managed to win a Pro Tour during their very impressive careers. They've both come close, each making it to the finals of a Pro Tour, but that last little bit has always eluded them. And this battle couldn't come at a more appropriate time. With one Pro Tour remaining on the schedule, both of these players are desperately trying to lock up a spot at the World Championship later this year.





*Hall of Famer Patrick Chapin and No. 13 Ranked Player Josh Utter-Leyton: two players with incredible records and a desire to earn their first Pro Tour title.*
