A resident of Nagoya, Japan, Seishirou Ookubo is known throughout both the Japanese **Magic** playing community as well as the artist community for his spectacular 3D card art, which has to be seen to be believed. Taking 5-6 cards, Seishirou turns a flat piece of cardboard into a breathtaking layered piece of art. When asked how he started making them, he had this to say:

"I first encountered **Magic** at Wonder Festival, a hobby modeling event in Japan. This was before Revised was being imported into Japan. I remember thinking it was odd for something like that to be sold at the event. Looking back on it, I wish I had purchased some.

"I first started playing **Magic** after 4th Edition began to be sold in Japan. That was before there were translated rules, so my friends and I kind of made up the rules we couldn't understand as we went along. Once the Japanese edition of 4th Edition came out, I started buying a lot of **Magic**—so much, in fact, that the cards started to take over my room!

"It was around this time that I noticed I had lots of duplicates of many cards. Since I'm a bit of a pack rat, and just can't throw away anything—especially something I've spent a lot of money and time on collected—I was at a loss for what to do. One night, I was looking at the Praedish Gypsy card, and for some reason I thought about some 3D art I had seen as a child, where multiple copies of the same illustration had been layered and cut out to create a 3D effect. I decided that's how I would solve my multiple card problem—by turning them into 3D art.

"In the beginning, I didn't have anything to work off of, so there were many failed attempts. At that time, it took me a couple of weeks to finish one card, so every time I did it was a cause for celebration. What really got me motivated was Brian Snoddy's reaction when I gave him one of my cards as a present at Grand Prix—Kyoto 98. That's when I realized that other people were as interested in this art as I was.

"It's been over eight years since I started making these cards, and there are still a lot of cards that I want to make into 3D art, while at the same time Wizards of the Coast keeps making more. I may never catch up!"
