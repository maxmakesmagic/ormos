**Age:** 28, sadly  
**Hometown:** Lisbon, Portugal  
**Occupation:** Durdling


 

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Six Grand Prix Top 8s, two Pro Tour Top 8s.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Red-Green-White Aggro because I didn't have four Temple of Malady; wanted to play Black-Green-White Constellation.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  
[Purphoros, God of the Forge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%2C+God+of+the+Forge) main deck. It's the sickest card in the entire block.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion).

**Hometown:** Málaga, Spain  
**Occupation:** Industrial engineer


 

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Shark Games Store best player.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Red-White Heroic. I had no time to test the format and it looked like my kind of deck.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

Prefer instant tricks over Ordeal and [Mogis's Warhound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%27s+Warhound).


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  

Any early creature. Maybe [Akroan Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Crusader), it's so hard to race.

### Fabrizio Anteri


**Age:** 24  
**Hometown:** Caracas, Venezuela

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Lost last round of Pro Tour Journey into Nyx to Owen Turtenwald, in a match for fame and glory.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

BUG Control. The longer games go, the more likely people are to make mistakes. And BUG makes sure games go very long.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

I took my chances not having a good match-up against aggro with my list and didn't pay for it. So I'm happy with my 75.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Prognostic Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx).
