Live Coverage of 2004 Grand Prix Washington, D.C.
=================================================




April 17-18, 2004

Thaaaat's Them!


**Thaaat's Me** is the Grand Prix DC Champions!


Bill Stead, Charles Gindy, and Chris Fennell were longshots to beat out a Top 4 field that included Jon Finkel, Brian Kibler, Eric Froehlich, Darwin Kastle, Rob Dougherty, Alex Shvartsman, Osyp Lebedowicz, Patrick Sullivan, and Adam Horvath. They were not be dismissed so easily!


Bill Stead had already won a Grand Prix in New Orleans and has been on a Top 16 rampage at Limited Pro Tours this past year. His teammate Chris Fennell had no finals experience coming into today but their third was Charles Gindy. Gindy had made the finals of the Team Grand Prix in Pittsburgh last year with a cobbled together team. The Florida group all live near each other and have put in plenty of practice for this event.





| Top 4 Final Standing |
| --- |
| 1. **Thaaaat's Me** (USA) | $4,500 |
| 2. **Shenanigans** (USA) | $3,000 |
| 3. **YMG/Illuminati** (USA) | $2,100 |
| 4. **Re-Elect Gore** (USA) | $2,000 |

Ironically they stole a victory from **Re-elect Gore** (Jon Finkel, Brian Kibler & Eric Froehlich) in the semi-finals when the third game of their worst match-up turned on a mana-screw victory over Brian Kibler. They proved their mettle against **Shenanigans** (Osyp Lebedowicz, Patrick Sullivan, & Adam Horvath) though with a solid draft and three tight matches. **Shenanigans** had defeated **Your Move Games/Illuminati** (Darwin Kastle, Rob Dougherty, & Alex Shvartsman) in the other semi-final match.


With **Chicken Sandwiches** (David Chung, Phil Napoli, and John Fiorello) nabbing $1,500 Amateur Prize everyone wandered off for a well deserved night's sleep.
