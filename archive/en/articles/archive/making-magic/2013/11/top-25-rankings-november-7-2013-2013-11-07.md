Welcome to the latest edition of the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings. The capital city of Santiago, in Chile, was the scene for [the latest Grand Prix](/en/events/coverage/chilean-navas-shows-madcap-skills), where No. 7-ranked Willy Edel looked to work his way up the leaderboard. His 7–2 record on Day One was enough to take him through to Sunday play, and although large Grand Prix can have several hundred Day Two entrants, Edel began Sunday in Santiago in 43rd place. 


There was a good chance that somebody would make the Top 8 with a 12–3 record, and Edel completed his side of the bargain with a 5–1 Day Two record. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough, and he had to be content with 12th place, netting him 3 Pro Points. This brings him much closer to the two Japanese powerhouses ahead of him in the rankings, Yuuya Watanabe and Shuhei Nakamura.


The two Japanese players are now tied at the 5th spot in the rankings this week, despite not playing in Santiago. With Watanabe having a higher 2012–13 points total than Nakamura, his overall ranking decays fractionally more than the 2008 Player of the Year. As a result, Nakamura moves up with Watanabe into the No. 5 spot. Above the Brazilian and the two Japanese, the Top 4 remains unchanged, with Hall of Famer Ben Stark continuing to top the rankings. 


 Next, it's back to Europe, and *Theros* Limited will be on show in Valencia. Will Martin Juza claim an astonishing nineteenth Grand Prix Top 8? Join us next week to see if he does, and who else is making a move up the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings.
