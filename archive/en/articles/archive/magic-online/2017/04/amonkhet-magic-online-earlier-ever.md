Amonkhet on Magic Online Is Earlier than Ever
=============================================



 Posted in **Magic Online**
 on April 12, 2017

*Magic Online* players have been used to having wait ten days, or sometimes as long as two weeks, to play the new set following the paper Prereleases.


No longer. Now you can play them *the next day*.


Play *Amonkhet* Prereleases in your [local game store](http://locator.wizards.com) on Saturday and Sunday, April 22–23. Then on Monday, April 24—the next day—you'll be able to play *Amonkhet* events on *Magic Online* as well!


Additionally, like with *Aether Revolt*, we're not going to have specific Prerelease events on *Magic Online*. Feedback from our *Aether Revolt* experiment with this went well, and players strongly enjoyed being able to play in the variety of events *Magic Online* normally offers.


Competitive and Friendly leagues will be available for sealed, and Competitive, Intermediate, and Friendly leagues will be available for draft. They will have the same entry and prize structures as they do now for *Aether Revolt*. New to *Magic Online* or want a refresher? You can see the full details at the end of this article.


Banned and Restricted Timing
============================


This new schedule did present a new timing question for us, however. Previously, *Magic Online* always began the new set after the banned and restricted changes were announced. However, now they are the same day! We also don't want to spoil the announcement, of course.


So we have two different plans for April 24, the "No Changes" plan and the "Any Changes" plan. You can see the details on each below. We wanted to provide them so players would have the right expectations about what would happen. **Please do not interpret the existence of the plan as Wizards planning a banned and restricted list change.** As I'm writing this article, no decisions have been made. We just wanted our plan to be thorough.




| No Changes |
| --- |
| Wednesday, April 19 | Downtime (*Amonkhet* build) |
| Monday, April 24 | *Aether Revolt* and *Legacy Cube* events close |
| Monday, April 24—8 a.m. PT | Banned and Restricted Announcement |
| Monday, April 24 | *Amonkhet* Limited Leagues begin |
| Monday, April 24 | *Amonkhet* Constructed Leagues begin |



| Any Changes |
| --- |
| Wednesday, April 19 | Downtime (*Amonkhet* build) |
| Monday, April 24 | *Aether Revolt* and *Legacy Cube* events close |
| Monday, April 24—8 a.m. PT | Banned and Restricted Announcement |
| Monday, April 24 | *Magic Online* downtime begins |
| Monday, April 24— around 12 p.m. PT | *Magic Online* downtime ends |
| Monday, April 24 | *Amonkhet* Limited Leagues begin |
| Monday, April 24 | *Amonkhet* Constructed Leagues begin |

If there are changes, *Magic Online* will go down to implement the banned and restricted changes. We'll also create the *Amonkhet* events while down, so players can join them immediately as soon as we're back up.


Unfortunately, implementing the banned and restricted changes currently requires a downtime. We are looking to expand our infrastructure in the future so that this is not necessary. The upside for Constructed players, however, is it means the banned and restricted changes will take effect the same day—in fact *mere hours* after—it is announced.


If this downtime happens, our goal is to make it as short as we can to let players play with *Amonkhet* cards as soon as possible, so we will not be running redemption. Players can redeem sets during the April 19 downtime as normal (regardless of any banned or restricted list changes).


We'll also be scheduling the new Constructed Leagues to end around the midseason banned and restricted timing. For any formats that change midseason, we'll let the existing League end and put up a new one in its place. Leagues for formats without a change will simply be extended to last until *Hour of Devastation* releases on *Magic Online*.


Prestige Avatars
================


As we have since *Kaladesh*, we want to allow players to demonstrate their trophy-winning accomplishments in Leagues. Here are the Silver, Gold, and Mythic Prestige Avatars you can earn by getting trophies in Constructed Leagues and *Amonkhet* Limited Leagues during *Amonkhet* season.


Here's how you can earn these:

* 5 or more trophies in the Friendly *Amonkhet* Draft League
* 5 or more trophies in the Intermediate *Amonkhet* Draft League
* 5 or more trophies in the Friendly *Amonkhet* Sealed League
* 2 or more trophies in any single Friendly Constructed League

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20190509001019im_/https://edit.magic.wizards.com/sites/mtg/files/images/hero/Oketra%20the%20True%20Avatar.png)


Gold Prestige Avatar: [Oketra the True](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oketra+the+True)


* 4 or more trophies in the Competitive *Amonkhet* Draft League
* 4 or more trophies in the Competitive *Amonkhet* Sealed League

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20190509001246im_/https://edit.magic.wizards.com/sites/mtg/files/images/hero/Liliana%20Deaths%20Majesty%20Avatar.png)


Mythic Prestige Avatar: [Liliana, Death's Majesty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+Death%27s+Majesty)


* 12 or more trophies in the Competitive *Amonkhet* Draft League
* 6 or more trophies in the Competitive *Amonkhet* Sealed League
* 6 or more trophies in any Competitive Constructed League
* Finishing with 6 or more wins in any single MOCS Monthly event during *Amonkhet* season

Prestige avatars will be granted at the conclusion of the *Amonkhet* season. Good luck earning those trophies and have fun showing off your accomplishments!


Treasure Chest Changes
======================


A few changes for Treasure Chests. First, we're reducing the frequency C16/CN2 cards appear from 4% in each of the three slots to 2% in those slots. Instead, you're more likely to get a curated card (in Slot 1) or a Modern rare/mythic rare (in Slot 2 and Slot 3). Here's the new table:




| Slot | Curated Card | Modern Rare/Mythic | C16/CN2 Cards | Play Points | Standard Commons/Uncommons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 21% | 47% | 2% | 30% | 0% |
| 2 | 5% | 12% | 2% | 0% | 81% |
| 3 | 1% | 5% | 2% | 0% | 92% |

The *Amonkhet* *Invocations* are being added to the curated card list with a frequency ratio of 20. Since we're moving away from *Kaladesh* block, the *Kaladesh* *Inventions*, already in the curated card list, are being reduced in frequency ratio from 20 to 6.


There are other changes to the curated list as well. Most notably, other versions of the *Amonkhet Invocation* cards are having their frequency ratios reduced to make room for the *Invocation* versions. You can see the curated card list changes (beyond the changes in the previous paragraph). A 0 for "Old Frequency Ratio" means that card is being added, while a 0 for "New Frequency Ratio" means that card is being removed.
