Live Coverage of 2004 Grand Prix Birmingham
===========================================












![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbir04/fin.jpg)**Stefan Jedlicka is the champion of Grand Prix Birmingham!**


The young Austrian player overcame Kai Budde in the last round to make top 8. Once there he made the best of a mediocre set of boosters to draft a blue-green deck that was slow but packing in power. He beat his younger brother in the Quarters, ended the home nations hope of a winner in David Grant before setting himself up for a clash in the final with Rene Kraft from Germany.


Kraft had gone on an unstoppable rampage and entered the final match with a perfect 16-0 record. It looked as though he would go all the way as his aggressive black-red knocked Jedlicka all the way back onto the ropes with some Vulshok Gauntlers in the deciding game. The German just couldn't find the killing blow as Jedlicka found creature after creature to get in the way before a top-decked [Wurmskin Forger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmskin+Forger) boosted his creatures enough to steal what looked like an improbable victory.

This is Jedlicka's second title after winning Grand Prix Prague last year.


Despite a pop concert next door, the clocks going forward for British Summer Time and what might be Magic's first ever streaker the tournament was a success. On day two a 30 player JSS, a 180 player PTQ and 87 side events were run alongside the main event. The store challenge, where a team scored points determining how well they did over the weekend, was won by Other Realms by a narrow margin over Westgate Games. They win a trip to the next Grand Prix in Bochum.
