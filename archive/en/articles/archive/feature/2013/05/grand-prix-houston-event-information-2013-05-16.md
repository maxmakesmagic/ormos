*Houston.* The first word said from the moon! This great city, the fourth largest in the U.S., will play host to one of this year's greatest **Magic** events, Grand Prix Houston. Whether or not this is your first rodeo in the **Magic** GP arena, you will have an incredible time at this event—because there is something for everyone. The format of this Grand Prix is *Return to Ravnica* Sealed Deck and Booster Draft, showcasing the entire block: *Return to Ravnica*, *Gatecrash* and *Dragon's Maze*. It is the only time in the United States that this format will be used at an individual Grand Prix. 

 The focus of this weekend is on fun for everyone, from the casual player to the Pro Tour champion. The Grand Prix will be amazing itself, but there are so many great side events, there will be no time to get bored. Enjoy the VIP service if you are playing in the Grand Prix, or play in our newly formatted Commander side events. Play Standard for Sealed Sets, or enjoy our Japanese Sealed Event with *Ravnica: City of Guilds* block and *Return to Ravnica* block sets (yep, you read that right!). We even have a Father's Day Two-Headed Giant event that is FREE for any parent/child team (event is open to all). And for those who decide to pre-register, you earn free entry to the Grand Prix Grand Melee! 

 So saddle up and make your plans to join us for a weekend of fun culminating Sunday with the thrilling Top 8 of the Grand Prix and the Super Sunday Series, an awesome event with a fantastic first prize: a trip to Wizards of the Coast in Seattle! Book the weekend of June 14-16 and plan to have one of the most **Magic**-al weekends ever. 

  

 *The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to step up your game, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic** players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition over three days. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, the Grand Prix features a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings. Side-event tournaments begin Friday, with the Grand Prix main event running Saturday and Sunday.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).

* Top 8 matches will have no time limit.
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria:
