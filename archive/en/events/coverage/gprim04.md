GRAND PRIX RIMINI 2004
----------------------


Domingo Ottati Gives Rimini a Rude Awakening
============================================




September 10-11, 2004











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprim04/win.jpg)It's been Domingo Ottati's tournament all the way. The Italian player was top of the standings at the end of day one and the only matches he lost were concessions to enable countrymen to get into the top 8.


751 players came to Rimini in a Grand Prix that was curiously lacking in recognized names. Perhaps it was because the tournament fell just after worlds, or perhaps because the *Mirrodin* block format is looking tired now, but all the Dutch Pro's stayed at home, as did most of the famous Germans. The tournament wasn't too kind to the Pro's who did make the trip and when the dust settled an unfamiliar top 8 was battling for the title.

It was a fantastic tournament for the host nation as no fewer than five Italians made it to the quarters. Despite Affinity being the dominant deck, the final was once again fought between a blue-green control and a [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) deck. Unlike GP Zurich, this time blue-green came out on top as Domingo Ottati smashed in Florian Pils with a massive entwined [Rude Awakening](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rude+Awakening) in both games. The crowd were chanting his name at the end as Domingo Ottati gave the host nation a well deserved victory.

Sunday, September 12: 5:28 pm - Top 8 Hijinks
---------------------------------------------


The last round saw some confusion. Antoine Ruel went 1-0 up against his opponent Daniel Krutil, but didn't realize a win could give him top 8. Fearing an *Onslaught* of [Slith Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Firewalker)s in games two and three he offered his opponent a draw that was accepted. All of a sudden the way was then open for David Brucker, who managed to win his final round.


Then Jan Brodzak and Luka Gasparac agreed to draw. That meant both of them would make it and shut out the rest of the 36 pointers.


Andrea Paselli and Luca Cialini clinched the remaining two places with last round wins.



Sunday, September 12: 4:37 pm - Entering the Final Round
--------------------------------------------------------


![I honestly don't know what this picture is.](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprim04/blog8.jpg)In the key matches of the last round saw four more players removed from contention as Stephan Fries, Vasilis Fatouros, Szymon Jankowski and Federico Cheli all lost their matches. It's shaping up to be a strong performance from the host nation as Ottatis can concede again in last round, this time giving a top 8 berth to fellow contryman Giovanni Gesiot. Davide Ghini ID's with Florian Pils to secure both their places.


Jan Brodzak of the Czech republic was the unfortunate player to get paired down and must scrap it out with Croatia's Luka Gasparac. The Italians are guaranteed another two places to go with the three already secured as Matteo Tosano gets to fight it out for a slot with Andrea Paselli while Rocco Palumbo takes on Luca Cialini.


Interestingly, because of the way the pairings have fallen the back door might have opened to allow Antoine Ruel to sneak in. The winner of his match with Daniel Krutil will probably take the last place.



Sunday, September 12: 3:41 pm - Two Rounds Left!
------------------------------------------------


![Recognize any of these guys?](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprim04/blog7.jpg)Round 14 is just starting and only the top 7 tables look to still be in contention. The challenge is to recognize any of the names. The likes of Barbero, Ruel and Brucker are now out with three or more losses. A draw in round 12 made the top 8 a lock for Domingo Ottati. This round he conceded to his countryman, Davide Ghini to decide the second Top 8 seed.


At least eight of the decks on the top 7 tables were Affinity with green-something decks and Big red making up the remainder.



Sunday, September 12: 2:13 pm - Expensive Salt!
-----------------------------------------------


![There's one born every minute.](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprim04/blog6.jpg)Astute readers will remember a certain shaggy dog tale yesterday about some French players, a magician and very expensive bag of salt. To recap, a group of French players were offered some phones and a camera for €160, only for the goods to be miraculously switched for a bag of salt after the transaction took place. We can now confirm this story is actually true.


Step forward and hang your heads in shame KLB, Truffe and Steph!
