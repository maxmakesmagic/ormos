This event will be the first Grand Prix in the United States to offer *Innistrad*  and *Dark Ascension*  Limited play, and the Planeswalker Points modifier of 8x will send your points soaring. 


In addition to the main event, there will be **Magic**  tournaments in a variety of formats running from Friday to Sunday, all with a Planeswalker Points multiplier of 3x. Card dealers from around the country will be on hand to help you round out your unique collection.
