Chances are that, unless you actually live in Worcester, Massachusetts, you aren't an avid reader of the *Worcester Telegram & Gazette*. Or unless you have an odd fascination with local news for cities that don't sound like they're spelled (it's pronounced "WOO-ster" for those who don't know).


However, chances are pretty good that, if you're reading this website (Hi!), you devour *Magic* content pretty readily. You might have even already been through the coverage of Robin Dolar's victory at [Grand Prix Boston-Worcester](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbos14). You might have even recognized the city of Worcester from hosting this very tournament, as well as ones in the past.


Well, we've got another piece of content that you might have missed over the weekend, as the Grand Prix specifically—and *Magic* generally—were featured in the [*Worcester Telegram & Gazette*](http://www.telegram.com/article/20140726/NEWS/307269744/0/SEARCH), as 2,500 players descended on the town for the weekend.


The article, by staffer Donna Boynton, features interviews with players who attended the tournament, as well as event organizer Tom Shea and Wizards of the Coast's own Ron Foster. It highlights a bit of *Magic*'s history by way of introduction, and then lets players give their reasons for attending and playing in the Grand Prix.


To read the full article, visit the [*Worcester Telegram & Gazette*](http://www.telegram.com/article/20140726/NEWS/307269744/0/SEARCH) website.
