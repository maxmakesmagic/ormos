![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptnice02/a790.jpg)At this stage neither player could reach top 8, and Chris had suffered a bit of a raw deal this round as he had been paired up against the winner of the draft having gone 1-2 himself.

Chris won the toss and asked Bram to play first.

"Good luck".  
 "Good luck".

Chris would like me to note that he was 1-0 in feature matches.

Neither player had to mulligan, so Bram made the first play – a [Frightcrawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightcrawler), who was matched by a [Patrol Hound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patrol+Hound) from the other side. Snepvangers then made an [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) which blocked the Hound, but was then [Afflict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict)ed.

Bram's [Rotting Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotting+Giant) started holding the fort for a bit, but then attacked into a freshly made [Dirty Wererat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat). A powerful play then saw the Dutchman cast [Mind Sludge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge) for 4 whilst the American was tapped out – forcing him to discard [Militant Monk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Militant+Monk), [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Aven Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock) and [Gallantry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gallantry) – leaving only one card in Chris's hand.

Despite this huge card advantage the Wererat was doing a good job of stabilizing the game on the ground. The lock might have been broken when Snepvangers summoned a [Thought Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Eater), but a [Patriarch's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire) saw its swift demise.

Unfortunately for the American his Wererat had approached threshold and became unable to block, so he started swinging with it instead – realizing he had to start racing. This rapidly became an unrealistic prospect though as Bram had summoned a [Skywing Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywing+Aven) and a [Chamber of Manipulation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chamber+of+Manipulation) which was making things incredibly difficult for Benefal. When Chris tried to cast [Gallantry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gallantry) on his [Patrol Hound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patrol+Hound), Bram used the Chamber to remove it from combat – so Chris was not entitled to draw the card as the Patrol was no longer blocking.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptnice02/a791.jpg)Once again the [Chamber of Manipulation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chamber+of+Manipulation) was used to great effect as an attempted [Shelter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter) on a freshly laid [Auramancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) was effectively countered as Chris no longer had control of the creature when the Chamber was used.

One would have thought that the [Mind Sludge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge) would have given the Dutchman enough advantage to control the game, but Chris' draws had been pretty good from that point onwards. The [Auramancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) had brought back the [Patriarch's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire), which then killed an Aqamoeba, and the life scores were balanced precariously at 3 to 2 in the American's favour as he prepared for his attack. The [Chamber of Manipulation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chamber+of+Manipulation) managed to deter him from swinging, but Chris had drawn an [Angelic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall) to stop the [Skywing Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywing+Aven) from finishing him off.. Snepvangers was faced with a difficult choice. Chris had one card in hand and mana open. Bram decided he would risk the possible [Embolden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embolden) or other trick and took control of the [Angelic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall) with his last remaining card in hand, then swung across with his 1/1 [Frightcrawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightcrawler) and his Aven. Should this attack have failed Chris would have won, but he did not have a trick in hand.

**Game 2**

Chris once again asked Bram to play first who made a third turn [Organ Grinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Organ+Grinder) which managed to swing across unopposed for 3. Chris rallied with a [Teroh's Faithful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teroh%27s+Faithful) to stop the beats.

"What have you got for me Bram? A little [Mind Sludge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge) action?"  
 "I have nothing," said Bram making an [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) on his fifth turn to join the Grinder and a [Sandstone Deadfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandstone+Deadfall).  
 "Not sure if I believe you," said Chris making a couple of [Dirty Wererat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat)s in two consecutive turns.

It became rapidly apparent that Bram might well have been telling the truth as he could only muster a [Rotting Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotting+Giant) to hold off the beats, but it was sufficient. Chris made an [Angelic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall).

Finally – off the top I think, Bram threw a [Mind Sludge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge) at Benefal who said "I saw that one coming a mile away". Before it resolved Chris cast [Afflict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict) on the [Organ Grinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Organ+Grinder), then discarded [Gallantry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gallantry), [Second Thoughts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains).

Deciding it was time for the beats to commence, Chris swung across with two 2/3 Wererats. One of them was blocked by an [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba), but Chris had [Shelter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter) 'blue' and achieved threshold. Bram responded to the [Shelter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter) by using his [Sandstone Deadfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandstone+Deadfall), but Chris used the last card in his hand to regenerate it again.

At this stage Bram had 3 cards in his hand to Chris's none, but was facing down two 4/5 regenerators. He rallied with a [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), which fetched an [Organ Grinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Organ+Grinder). Chris swung again with the rats – one of which was double blocked, but he had drawn a great card for the situation – a [Shelter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter), so no cards were lost from his hand as the [Rotting Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotting+Giant) sailed to his opponent's bin.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptnice02/a792.jpg)Still on heavy defense Bram made a [Thought Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Eater) and a second [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba), then chumped a rat with a [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger).

Chris: "These guys are savage!"  
 Bram: "Yes they certainly are."

After a few more chumps and an [Obsessive Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsessive+Search) Bram conceded gracefully.

Chris: "I liked that [Mind Sludge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge) – it gives me threshold every time!"

**Game 3**

Bram decided to draw.

**C:**[Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains)  
**B:**[Seafloor Debris](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seafloor+Debris)  
**C:**[Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Angelic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall)  
**B:**[Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Rotting Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotting+Giant)  
**C:**[Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Militant Monk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Militant+Monk)  
**B:**[Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Thought Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Eater) (had to discard [Obsessive Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsessive+Search), then had to discard [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island))  
**C:**[Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Teroh's Faithful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teroh%27s+Faithful)  
**B:**[Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Treetop Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Sentinel)  
**C:**[Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Aven Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock)  
**B:**[Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst) the Flock, attack with the fliers. STANDSTILL! – Ouch. This was a crippling blow for Chris who then passed his next turn, and attempted to cast [Second Thoughts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts) on the Sentinel, triggering the [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill). It resolved, but the game was pretty much lost for the American from this point as Bram summoned a [Dirty Wererat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat), slapped a [Ghostly Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Wings) on it making it a 5/6 regenerating flier, then spanked his bottom blue with it. The re-summoned Flock looked like it might stabilize the situation, but it was Dematerialised twice in two successive turns for the win.

**Final Result:** Bram won 2-1
