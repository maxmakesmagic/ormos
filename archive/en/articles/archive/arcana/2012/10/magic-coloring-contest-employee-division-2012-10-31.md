It's time to revisit the [**Magic** Coloring Book](/en/articles/archive/magic-gathering-coloring-book-2012-10-18)! After the [coloring contest at PAX](/en/articles/archive/coloring-contest-winners-2012-10-05) was such a success, we decided to have one internally here at Wizards of the Coast!


There were three categories: Best Jace, Best Nicol Bolas, and Most Creative. Because there are a number of people here with actual artistic talent, I tried for the "Most Creative" prize. See what you think:

Instead of using crayons, I scanned in the sheet and then did some nonsense with Photoshop. No, I did not win. But here's what did!


### Best Jace

Yes, that's a watercolor. Here's a close-up so you can see the work!

The glittery parts aren't just glitter. They're glittery *thread* that has been sewn into the paper!
