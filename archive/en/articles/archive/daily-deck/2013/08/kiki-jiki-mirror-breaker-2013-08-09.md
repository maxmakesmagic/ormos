I've always thought it was a shame how often Kiki-Jiki just ends the game, so I set out to build a Commander deck where he wouldn't. The idea is that Kiki-Jiki is sweet, and has a ton of combos, but none of them are actually infinite. I wanted to figure out a way to only slightly crack the mirror, not just full-on break it.

I divided the creatures I was planning on playing into two main categories, the first being "creatures that are awesome to copy."

 Most creatures in the deck fall under that category, providing a whole ton of enters-the-battlefield effects, from land destruction ([Ravenous Baboons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baboons)) to direct damage ([Bogardan Hellkite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bogardan+Hellkite)) to amassing a whole army of tokens ([Siege-Gang Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander)). That last section combos quite nicely with the second main category of creatures: "Goblins." 

 Goblins tend to work better in large groups, despite not being the most civic-minded of creatures. All sorts of lords make your army better, and all sorts of creative Goblins have thought of inventive ways to use Goblin tokens (mostly as ammunition). As the flavor text of [Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver) wisely states: *"Throw enough goblins at any problem and it should go away. At the very least, there'll be fewer goblins."*

Besides the massive amount of creatures, no self-respecting red deck would be complete without some burn spells, of which I've added a decent amount. Throw in a few artifact mana sources (Kiki-Jiki doesn't get out of bed for less than five mana, and that's on a good day), a couple sweet spells, and you have yourself a full-fledged mono-red deck.
