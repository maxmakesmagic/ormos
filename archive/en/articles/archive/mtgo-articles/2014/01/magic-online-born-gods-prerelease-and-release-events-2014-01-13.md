Magic Online Born of the Gods Prerelease and Release Events
===========================================================



 Posted in **Magic Online**
 on January 21, 2014 












**Update 1/20/2014:** Added [Prerelease promo cards](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014#prerelease) for Hero's Destiny entry objects.




Awaken the Myth!![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/logo_main_bng.png)
The god-realm of Nyx has been flung into chaos as Xenagos claims the mantle of the god of revelry, and his ascension sends ripples across the mortal realm!


[*Born of the Gods*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Products.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/products/bornofthegods)  is upon us, and that means it is nearly time for the *Born of the Gods*  Prerelease and Release events to come to **Magic Online**.


Prerelease events will begin on Friday, February 14, at 10:00 AM PST (18:00 UTC), and will run through the weekend. Prerelease events will conclude and *Born of the Gods*


Release Events will begin on Monday, February 17, at 10:00 AM (18:00 UTC). At that time, *Born of the Gods*  will go on sale in the **Magic Online**  store.![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/icon_bng.png)


In *Born of the Gods,* players will continue their heroic path by choosing their Destiny. [A Destiny entry object](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014#prerelease) can be purchased from the **Magic Online**  store for $5.00 starting Wednesday, February 12, following downtime. These will grant access to Prerelease Events.

On-Sale: 10AM February 17, 2014

\![Nyxborn Shieldmate](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/img_shieldmate.jpg)
We continue to optimize **Magic Online**  events based on player feedback and trends we observe in player activity. We have restructured *Born of the Gods* [16-Player Sealed Release Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014#rel16sealed), greatly increasing the number of booster packs awarded (an additional 30 booster packs per event as compared to *Theros*). To make this possible, we increased the entry requirement by six Event Tickets per player to 26 Event Tickets.


In addition to the normal draft offerings, we're adding two *Born of the Gods*-only Draft Events to the event roster: [8-4 Single-Elimination Drafts](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014#relbngonly84) and [Swiss Drafts](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014#relbngonlydraft).


We've also changed how Prerelease and Release avatars are acquired. Players can earn the avatars they want simply by [participating in the events that award them](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014#avatars). Collect only the ones you want, or collect them all.


With our Release Events, we are starting the 64-Player Drafts two days earlier than we did with *Theros*. They begin following the downtime on Wednesday, February 19. On weekends beginning February 21, we will host the Top 8 [Release Sealed Premier Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014#relsealedprem), as well.


Happy Playing!
