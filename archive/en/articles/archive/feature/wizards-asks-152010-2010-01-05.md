*What's the fastest you've ever won a Limited game?* 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** Stop me if you've heard this one, but *Zendikar* Limited is pretty fast. It's also the current draft format. So it's not too surprising that my own personal fastest Limited kill (or at least the fastest one I can remember) was in a recent *Zendikar* draft. This game was nowhere near typical, though, even for this particular deck.


I had drafted mono-red, a favorite of mine in this draft format. We were at a ten-person table, and I'd managed to pick up some pretty exciting multiples for my deck. My first opponent was developer and Latest Developments author Tom LaPille. Tom almost always beats me when we play, but this time I had a very fast deck that might be able to seal the deal before Tom outmaneuvered me.


Nothing happened on my first turn except a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)—not exactly a blazing start—but my second turn got going with another [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and the always-excellent [Plated Geopede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Geopede). My third turn brought another [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), pumping my Geopede. But I followed that up with a kicked [Goblin Bushwhacker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bushwhacker) to attack for a total of 6. That put Tom at 14.

Tom got out a blocker on his third turn, which is the only reason he survived my fourth turn: [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), second kicked [Goblin Bushwhacker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bushwhacker), *third* kicked [Goblin Bushwhacker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bushwhacker), attacking with three 3/1s and a 5/3 for a total of ... yep, 14. Tom blocked the [Plated Geopede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Geopede) to stay alive at 5, and held on for another turn, but by the end of my turn four I'd dealt 20 damage in combat and effectively ended the game—close enough to a turn-four win in my book.
