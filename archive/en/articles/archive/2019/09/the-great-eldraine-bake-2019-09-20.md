From deliciously dubious pies to lavish roasts and everything in-between, the world of Eldraine is filled with delightful delicacies.


But it’s missing one special dish – yours!


We’re looking for your best Eldraine-inspired recipes – pies, puddings, loaves, roasts, soups, desserts, anything you can think of – in the very first Great Eldraine Bake-Off (#EldraineBakeOff). Entering is simple: Send us your complete recipe and a picture of your dish to [MagicCommunityTeam@wizards.com](mailto:MagicCommunityTeam@wizards.com), along with your email, postal address, and phone contact. The more scrumptious your dish looks, the better! Our team of food enthusiasts (there are many of those here at Wizards) and Eldraine experts want to be able to smell your dish through our screens. All entries must be received no later than 11:59 p.t. on October 4. After that, our inbox turns back into a pumpkin and we can’t accept any more recipes.


Our ten favorite creators will be awarded special prizes to commend your culinary abilities! Let’s take a look at what you could win:


* **First Place**: One [*Throne of Eldraine* Deluxe Collection](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/throne-eldraine-deluxe-collection-2019-09-19), one premium foil full set of *Throne of Eldraine*, one premium foil full set of *War of the Spark*, and ten *Throne of Eldraine* pack codes for MTG Arena.
* **Second and Third Place**: One premium foil full set of *Throne of Eldraine*, one premium foil full set of War of the Spark, and ten Throne of Eldraine pack codes for MTG Arena.
* **Fourth through Tenth Place**: One premium foil full set of War of the Spark and ten Throne of Eldraine pack codes for MTG Arena.

While we appreciate recipes of the magical variety, be sure to send us something we could make using ingredients of this world. Magic apples and beanstalk vines might make for a great salad, but those ingredients are terribly difficult to find at our local grocers. Outside of that, anything goes! Get creative and show us something that would fit perfectly into the world of *Eldraine*.


And with that, get to cooking! We can’t wait to see what you have in store for us. Share your progress with us on Twitter and Instagram using the hashtag #EldraineBakeOff!
