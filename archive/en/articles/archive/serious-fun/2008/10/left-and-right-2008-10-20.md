[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=%5Bcard%5D)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%5Bcard%5D)I'm feeling much better than [last week](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/8) (thanks to everybody who wrote in wishing me well!), and I'm ready to actually *play* some **Magic**. It's rather nice not to feel like a shambling zombie, even if it would have been entirely appropriate for Grixis Week.

Grixis is—let me put this bluntly—kind of a nasty place. It's got blue, black, and red mana, but no white or green mana to speak of. Without white to impose rules and green to make things flourish, Grixis is a place of unchecked death and decay. Lich-kings rule over crumbling necropolises, zombies and skeletons roam a landscape that is actually—skip the rest of this sentence if you're reading this right before lunch—*made of rotting flesh*. The few living humans have to skulk in the shadows just to keep from having their life energy harvested by some undead necromancer.

Grixis is big on recycling. There's no new life energy, ever, and that means every bit of life, every scrap of flesh, gets used and reused and re-reused. Demons terrorize necromancers, necromancers turn humans into zombies, zombies rot into skeletons, skeletons crumble to bones, and bones, apparently, are [quite the fashion statement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=quite+the+fashion+statement). The entire plane is a snake eating its own tail.

Say, that's rather a poetic image, isn't it? As it happens, that poetic image reminds me of a **Magic** format—one where everyone is part of a vicious, downward-spiraling cycle.

Uh, except fun.

**Format: Attack Left or Attack Right****In Brief:** At the start of the game, the table chooses left or right. Each player's creatures can attack only the closest opponent in the chosen direction.

**Rules Rundown:** By default, the attack restrictions cover attacking only; you can still play spells targeting whoever you want. If you feel that's outside the spirit of the format, though, you can use house rules to change it.

If the person you're supposed to be attacking leaves the game, you can now attack the next person around the circle. As with Free-for-All, the winner is the last player standing (or the first to get off a "You win the game" effect like [Barren Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Glory)).

There aren't any official rules regarding who can attack a planeswalker in this format, so it's a good idea to talk about that before the game if you have a planeswalker in your deck. It seems fair to say that you can only attack a planeswalker if you could attack its controller, but it could be argued that the rules only place restrictions on which *players* you can attack. Pick whichever house rule makes the most sense to you.

Other than the attack restrictions, this is a normal game of multiplayer **Magic**. Seating order matters, so you may want to randomize seating if you're worried about that sort of thing.

**Pros:** Remember a while ago when I [wrote about](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/2) the problem of who to attack in multiplayer? Yeah, none of that here. You don't have to worry about who to attack or who might attack you. This also means that you can pay a little less attention than usual during people's turns if they're not sitting to your immediate left or right. If your group tends to pounce on any player who falls behind, this format may take a little bit of the pressure off.

Because attacking is easier and you don't have to worry as much about defending yourself, this is a good format if you find yourself wishing your group were more aggressive. I like it best for smaller tables (two to four players), where choosing who to attack can have too huge an effect on the game.

**Cons:** Remember a while ago when I [wrote about](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/sf5) the problem of differences in experience or card pool? This format can have the unfortunate effect of making those problems worse, because that player with the killer deck is only really facing two opponents instead of three or four, only one of whom can actually attack. Also, you may find it boring at bigger tables to have several players whose turns don't make much difference to you.

A Little to the Left
To try out the format, I sat down with my friend Laura, my co-worker Dave, and Matt, a schoolmate of Laura's. "Attack Left" is the more common variant, so we decided to go with that.

I used a blue-black-red snow deck in honor of Grixis Week (although truthfully, the deck is mostly blue-red; black is a splash for Garza Zol, the Plague Queen). To my left was Dave, piloting his deck from the Box League he and I are in at work. It's some kind of weird four-color mashup centered on [Sedris, the Traitor King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedris%2C+the+Traitor+King). Across from me was Matt. I had never met him before and didn't know what he was playing, but it was in pink sleeves. I've learned to always fear a deck in pink sleeves.

To my right was Laura, running a gigantic pile of Naya cards she wanted to try. She'd been working on the deck before the game, and rather than hold things up trying to cut it down to 60 cards, she just added enough lands to make it run and called it a deck. She did, however, put serious thought into her mana base. That, or world domination. It's hard to tell from these scribblings:
