Day 2 Coverage



Grand Prix Singapore is officially in the books! After fifteen rounds of Standard and the exciting playoffs, the field of 682 was down to just a single man. Singled out as one of the hot favorites to win it all, Ishikawa failed to disappoint and took down his fourth Grand Prix title in his ninth lifetime Grand Prix Top 8. Defeating Li Jingling in the quarterfinals, Andy Chan in the semifinals, and then Ohki Tatsuhiko in the finals, Ishikawa’s White-Blue God Pharaoh’s Gift deck outlasted the competition.


Rounding out the rest of the Top 8 was Ryoichi Tamada (who went 13-0-2 during the Swiss rounds only to fall short to the eventual finalist), Grzegorz Kowalski (who made Platinum this weekend), Rei Sato, and Ryo Okamoto. Once again, kudos to Yuuki Ichikawa for winning Grand Prix Singapore 2018!

Day 1 Coverage



Time flies when you’re enjoying yourself, isn’t it? After eight rounds of competition, the field of 682 was down to just 145. Among those were six undefeated players, namely Grand Prix Hong Kong winner Rei Sato, Pro Tour Battle for Zendikar champion and finalist, Kazuyuki Takimura and Ryoichi Tamada, Kouhei Watanabe, Grand Prix Tokyo 2016 Top 8 competitor Eng Chu Heng, and Grand Prix Melbourne Champion Nam Sung Wook.


Close behind was a swath of talent, including 21st-ranked Kelvin Chew, former Malaysia National Champion Rick Lee, three-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor Qi Wentao, Pro Tour Hour of Devastation semifinalist Yam Wing Chun, Grand Prix Kobe 2015 Champion Takuma Morofuji, and three-time Grand Prix Champion Yuuki Ishikawa. That’s not all, because we still have several notable 7-1 players, such as Grand Prix Minneapolis 2016 Champion Park Jun Young, China National Champion Liu Yuchen, Pro Tour Charleston 2006 Champion Tomohiro Kaji, as well as Pro Tour *Dominaria* Top 8 competitor Ernest Lim.


That was an indication of an extraordinarily stacked field, especially when numerous huge names were lurking at 6-2 records, such as 9th-ranked Ken Yukuhiro, 12th-ranked Shota Yasooka, 15th-ranked Grzegorz Kowalski and more!


Be back tomorrow as we delve deeper into the world of Standard and examine how the format has evolved. We’ll be delivering the full Day 2 Metagame Breakdown and a Deck Tech or two, along with other compelling stories. Most importantly, the Unlimited Booster Draft will also take place tomorrow evening, so stay tuned as we bring you an overview of the action!
