The *Alara Reborn* Borderposts are many things. They're multicolored cards, they're artifacts, they're manafixing, and so on. But have you taken a close look at them? Because it turns out their flavor is also central to the theme of the block.

Take [Fieldmist Borderpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fieldmist+Borderpost), which provides both white and blue mana. It stands literally on the border between Bant and Esper, as you can tell from the terrain on either side of the art:

The [Mistvein Borderport](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistvein+Borderport), then, stands between the lands of Esper and Grixis:

Next, we see the [Veinfire Borderpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veinfire+Borderpost) between Grixis and Jund:

That takes us to the fourth borderpost, the [Firewild Borderpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firewild+Borderpost) between Jund and Naya:

Finally, we come full circle with the [Wildfield Borderpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfield+Borderpost) between Naya and Bant:
