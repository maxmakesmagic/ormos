Today we take a look at alternate Chinese art in *Guildpact*. [Remember](/en/articles/archive/alternate-chinese-art-ravnica-part-1-2005-11-14), Chinese regulations require that human skeletons not appear in the art of **Magic** cards distributed there. As **Magic** is a fantasy game with an entire color devoted to dark fantasy elements, skeletons show up a lot -- and *Guildpact* is no exception.


With *Guildpact* following up a set full of the dredge mechanic, the *Invasion* reprint **[Cremate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cremate)** was a welcome piece of utility to help deal with *Ravnica's* recursive threats. But dealing with the graveyard as it does, [Cremate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cremate)'s art had a few too many human skulls in the art for the Chinese market. Here's Paolo Parente's art for the *Guildpact*  [Cremate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cremate), and the touch-ups that were made in the Chinese printing.

For **[Sanguine Praetor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanguine+Praetor)**, rk post was set to the task of creating an otherworldly avatar of overwhelming evil. The art description also called for it to have a cow skull for a head, and as you can see, that came through nicely. But for the Chinese market, the problem wasn't the Praetor's cow skull -- it was the heads on posts behind him. In the alternate art version, the skull features have been covered over, although the objects are still suggestively head-shaped.

There are two more pieces of Chinese alternate art in *Guildpact* which we'll cover in a future Arcana.
