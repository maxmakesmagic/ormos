In the second elimination round of the Australia Nationals Finals Cael McGann playing Fires squared off against Michael Mercer, also playing Fires.


**Game 1**


The first game saw each player cast a first turn Elf. With this speed Cael played a Chimeric Idol while Michael cast a Flametongue Kavu on Cael's Elf. Both cards later met in battle leaving only small Elves and Birds on the battlefield. Suffering from bad draws both players subsequently played lands for the next three turns before Michael played a Saproling Burst along with a River Boa.


Cael slowed the game to a halt with his own Burst. The following turns saw little play while the two Bursts on the table slowly dissipated. The situation looked better for Cael when he played his Fires followed by the huge and game ending Shivan Wurm. Unleashing an attack with the Wurm Michael could only defend with his Boa still taking 6-trample damage. The next turn saw Cael's second Burst. Creating three 4/4 creatures and with the help of the Shivan Wurm, Cael promptly ended the first game.


**Game 2**


The second game was anyone's bet. Cael sideboarded five cards to Michael's three. Electing to play first, Michael was unfortunate to have to paris to six cards. Cael had the same fate and first parised to six before having to paris to five. The game looked to be in Michael's favor with Cael going down to five cards.


Playing a mountain Michael had little to do while Cael was lucky enough to play an Elf followed by a Blasterdom. With only two lands Michael was pessimistic, with defeat being close by. Cael capitalized on Michael's situation with a Flametongue Kavu on his own birds. With no answer to the Kavu and only two lands Michael gracefully accepted defeat.


**Final Result:** 2-0 Cael McGann
