 4003 players came to New Jersey this weekend with dreams of being crowned Grand Prix New Jersey Champion. Now, after fifteen rounds of swiss and two elimination rounds, only two remain. Brian Braun-Duin and Tom "The Boss" Ross spent the last week testing together in Roanoke, Virginia. [Clear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clear)ly, their partnership has paid vast dividends. It's unfathomable to imagine that a pair of testing partners would meet in the finals of a tournament this large, but here they are. Who will be crowned Grand Prix New Jersey Champion? Tom Ross and his infectious army or Brian Braun-Duin and his Jeskai Stoneblade deck? They're rooming together this weekend, so the bragging rights of victory are at least comparable to the victory itself.



In the first game, Ross's opening hand wasn't quite good enough, but six were better. Braun-Duin confidently kept seven. 



 Braun-Duin opened the action with a [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) for full information of The Boss's devious plans.




 Ross tried to find [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) with [Crop Rotation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crop+Rotation) on Braun-Duin's end step, but Braun-Duin happily traded two cards for two cards with [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will).




 Braun-Duin played enough cantrips and fetch lands to cast [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) for two mana relatively early in the game. Ross responded with [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), but couldn't find an answer and was forced to allow his friend to draw three cards.
