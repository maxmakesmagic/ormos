As we've seen before, original art is often commissioned for the tokens of token-generating cards, either for **Magic** Player Rewards prizes or to serve as the visuals for ***Magic** Online* creature tokens. 

Way back during *Ravnica* previews, we showed you the [first set of token art](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/913) for *Ravnica's* Hunted creatures. Today we show you the rest.

When your opponent plays out the two-mana 7/7 trampler **[Hunted Horror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Horror)**, you get a pair of 3/3 pro-black hunters. Centaurs, to be exact:

Speaking of horrors, you get a 4/4 one when your opponent graces his board with the 5/5 flying **[Hunted Lammasu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Lammasu)**. Note how you can see the [Hunted Lammasu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Lammasu) up above the Horror:

As a bonus, here's the art commissioned for the *Ravnica* Spirit token, generated by **[Transluminant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transluminant)** and **[Twilight Drover](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Drover)**:
