*Magic*'s scenery changes every set. Sometimes it's as dramatic as the lands in *Innistrad* as compared to those of *Avacyn Restored*, but it's change that always comes in unique and exciting ways. Today, that change is in the ways we deliver coverage of the Pro Tour to you all.


At Pro Tour *Dark Ascension* we went from one day of coverage to covering all three.


For Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored*, we are debuting our completely new coverage set, an evolution of our own coverage landscape. No longer is it just the two-man team in the booth. Now our video coverage team is six people, and the set they broadcast from looks like this.

*The Pro Tour's news desk is the place for event updates, analysis, and deck techs.*


Pretty awesome, right?


It's a new booth from the ground up with more space and better lighting. Even bigger though is the addition of a completely new set to broadcast from: the news desk. It will be used between rounds as a place for analysis and it's where we'll show deck techs and hold interviews with the players.


I sat down and talked to Greg Collins, who oversees all coverage of *Magic* Pro Tours and Grand Prix events. His main excitement was what this new coverage set enables us to do. We're able to provide more analysis of games by taking advantage of our expanded video coverage team. Using the new set, we'll no longer have any playback breaks between rounds or during drafts. Instead, we'll be able to stay live.


I also got the chance to show the new set to our newest broadcaster: Marshall Sutcliffe. This will be his first time broadcasting a Pro Tour and he's in for a treat. I wish I had been able to capture his face when he saw the set for the first time. "I didn't know what to expect, but it wasn't this." To be succinct: we blew his mind.


Marshall will be broadcasting alongside Brian David-Marshall, Rich Hagon, Sheldon Menery, Rashad Miller and, oh yeah, Zac Hill, Developer of R&D, author of Latest Developments, and ex-Pro Tour competitor himself.

*Our broadcasters are ready to bring you live updates and discussion on the latest developments here in Barcelona!*

Not to be outdone we've got a rock-star crew for text coverage here in Barcelona including Limited Information author Steve Sadin, Nate Price, and Josh Bennett. We'll be bringing you feature match coverage and other written pieces from talking with the pros. I'm the new guy around these parts by quite the long shot, but in doing so I bring my unique perspective. I'm able to take those steps back and enjoy the scenery around me.


It's going to be a great weekend for *Magic*!
