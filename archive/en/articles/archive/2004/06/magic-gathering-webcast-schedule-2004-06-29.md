### INSIDE THE BOOTH



**Brian David-Marshall, Pro Tour Historian**


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_briandavid-marshall.jpg)
Brian David-Marshall has been involved in almost every aspect of **Magic**  since shortly after being introduced to the game in 1994—he even created a comic book character for Marvel comics named Mize. A contributor to **magicthegathering.com** since 2001, he is the longest-tenured columnist for the site after Mark Rosewater. Brian became a member of the coverage team in 2002 and joined the webcast in 2005.


"It is hard to imagine seeing better game play than on a Sunday at the Pro Tour. Coverage of the Pro Tour is constantly pushing ahead and Rich Hagon and I are looking forward to the innovations of a new decade on the Pro Tour."


"To stand on stage for the induction of Hall of Fame classes led by Jon Finkel, Bob Maher, Kai Budde, Dirk Baberowski, and Antoine Ruel—to watch that cream rise to the very top—it eradicates any doubt that **Magic**  is a game of skill."


In addition to his involvement with **Magic** as an independent contractor, Brian still plays **Magic**  on a regular basis and is the publisher at [Top8Magic.com](http://www.Top8Magic.com), which has released the books *Michael J. Flores: Deckade*  and *Zvi Mowshowitz: My Files Part One*, and where he podcasts semi-regularly with both authors.


**Rich Hagon, Pro Tour Statistician**


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_richardhagon.jpg)
Rich Hagon has been an entertainer since first stepping onto the stage at the age of two. He has performed live in numerous countries around the world, and combines a deep knowledge of the players of the Pro Tour with a passionate love of the game.


He began playing **Magic** in 1997, and has two Pro Tour appearances to his name: London 1999 and Philadelphia 2005.


Rich's event coverage career began by podcasting from the European Grand Prix circuit in 2006, and he officially joined the Pro Tour event coverage staff at the beginning of 2007.


As the Pro Tour Statistician, he spends his time analyzing the careers of the best players in the world, and he looks forward to sharing many new insights into the Tour during his partnership with Brian David-Marshall in the Top 8 webcasts.


"There's nothing more exciting to me than seeing two great players at their absolute mental limit, going toe-to-toe for $40,000 on the turn of a card. For sheer human drama, it's hard to match, and I can't wait to share the fun and excitement with Pro Tour fans around the world. At its best, it's quite simply the best game in the world."


**Rashad Miller, GGslive.com Founder** 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_rashadmiller.jpg)
Rashad Miller has worn many hats throughout his **Magic**  career. He was introduced to the game in 1996 and became a certified judge in 2002. He played in his first Pro Tour in Kobe 2004 and became certified as a Level 3 judge that same year. He would have three more Pro Tour appearances: Honolulu in 2005, Kyoto in 2008, and a top 16 finish in Berlin 2008.


Rashad has been a part of the Pro Tour webcast team as the Top 8 spotter from 2006 to 2009. This led to his inclusion to the event coverage staff in 2010 as a writer for DailyMTG.com as well as the floor reporter during the Pro Tour Top 8 webcasts.


Rashad is probably most notably known for creating [ggslive.com](http://www.ggslive.com) in late 2009. There he provides live video coverage of **Magic**  Grand Prix and other independent tournament series for the **Magic**  community's enjoyment. He has now partnered with Wizards of the Coast to provide live streaming of U.S. and Canadian Grand Prix for 2012.


"I've watched professional **Magic**  being played from just about every angle. No matter whether you are watching as a judge, as a reporter, or as the opponent, when you see an amazing play that you know will become one of those memorable moments, you live and relive that moment as a fan of the game."


**Sheldon Menery, Judge Emeritus** 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_sheldonmenery.jpg)
Judge Emeritus Sheldon Menery is arguably the most influential judge in the history of the game. He popularized online **Magic**  Qamp;A with “Ask the Judge” on Star City Games and was the leading force in redefining fair play at the professional level. He is well-known for pioneering Commander and remains the primary public face of the format and its Rule Committee. He currently writes a feature column on Star City Games focusing on the format.


Sheldon began playing the game at its introduction in 1993 and was certified as a Judge in 1997. He has Head Judged countless Pro Tours, World Championships, and Grand Prix, as well as playing in five National Championships. Having recently retired from active judging, he turns his considerable experience with **Magic** toward covering the game at its highest level.


"Being a part of helping **Magic**  grow has been an amazing experience. Having a ringside seat to some of Pro Tour's defining moments—Kai Budde's 'Gotterdamerung' comes to mind—have been remarkable moments not just in my **Magic**  career, but in life."


"There is a power and a majesty to this game, a beautiful ballet of a myriad moving parts. I still have a sense of wonder not only when I'm immersed in playing it, but watching the art form it becomes in truly skilled hands."


**Zac Hill, former member of Magic Ramp;D** 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_zachill.jpg)
Zac Hill was a lead game designer for **Magic: The Gathering**  Ramp;D for several years prior to leaving the company to pursue other interests in 2012. He served on the development teams of *Mirrodin Besieged*, *New Phyrexia*, and *Dark Ascenscion*, lead the development of *Magic 2013* and *Dragon's Maze*, and worked on *Return to Ravnica*, *Gatecrash*, and *Theros*. He has playtested every set since *Rise of the Eldrazi*  and wrote the “Latest Developments” column for MagicTheGathering.com while at Wizards.


Before he arrived at Wizards of the Coast, Zac had played professional **Magic**  for nearly half his life. He debuted on the Junior Super Series circuit in the late nineties and made his first Pro Tour appearance at the age of fifteen at Pro Tour New Orleans 2001.


His professional accomplishments include a Top 8 finish at Pro Tour Honolulu 2009, a top four finish at Malaysian Nationals 2009, and a finals finish at Grand Prix St. Louis 2006. From 2005-2009 he wrote the "Chatter of the Squirrel" column at StarCityGames.com. His favorite **Magic**  card is [Might of Oaks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Oaks).


**Marshall Sutcliffe, Limited Resources Podcaster**


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_marshallsutcliffe.jpg)
Marshall Sutcliffe returned to **Magic**  in 2008 and immediately fell in love with the skill-intensive Limited formats. After diving in and facing the realization that he wasn't as good as he wished to be, he started a podcast with (now Wizards Ramp;D member) Ryan Spain called Limited Resources which talked about strategies for improving one's Magic game. Draft videos, the biggest clan on Magic Online, a spot on a **Magic Online** Community Cup championship team, and commentating soon followed.


Marshall's first commentating experience came when he was asked to join Rich Hagon and Brian David-Marshall in the booth at Grand Prix Austin 2012 (where he finished 51st). Soon afterward he made his official debut as part of the coverage team in the booth at Grand Prix Seattle-Tacoma 2012.


Marshall considers himself a student of the game, and is always looking to learn more about playing, covering, and improving at **Magic**.


"I have always loved digging deep into the details of a complex game like **Magic**. Doing commentary lets me be the voice for the viewer as we navigate together through the intricate journey that makes every game of **Magic**  unique."
