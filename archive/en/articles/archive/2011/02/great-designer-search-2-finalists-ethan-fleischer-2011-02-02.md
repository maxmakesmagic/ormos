### Comments


"Tooth and Claw" is about dinosaurs and evolution. The name is from a phrase by Tennyson, oft quoted by people referring to evolution's savage and competitive aspect: "Nature, red in tooth and claw."


The Evolve mechanic has been simplified into its most basic form, and is now a keyword. Under the Evolve rules, an ability such as Potbreaker Bull's second ability only triggers if the controller chooses to add a +1/+1 counter.


The deck is designed to play creatures with Evolve early on, then it tries to trigger Evolve as many times as possible by playing a series of ever-larger creatures. It includes tools, such as spells that search for extra lands, creatures with a high power-to-mana-cost ratio, and a tutor that can find powerful creatures, to enable this strategy. Having so many creatures with Evolve in a deck is an inherently high-variance strategy, but the deck has enough resilience to come back from a bad situation.


Regarding reprints, playtesting revealed the need of a cheap burn spell, but Epolith's cheap burn spell uses the Dominance mechanic, which is off-limits, hence the inclusion of [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). I decided to include in Epolith a cycle of reprints from Alpha to help sell the "primitive" flavor of the setting. Instead of the weird out-of-color-pie spells we saw reprinted in Time Spiral, these are simple, primitive versions of spells we see in sets today. Of the cycle, only [War Mammoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Mammoth) was suitable for Tooth and Claw.


Many thanks to everyone who contributed!
