Getting Ready for World Magic Cup Qualifiers

Hélène Bergeot started her career with Wizards of the Coast in France in December, 1995; afterwards, she spent a few years in the European headquarters based in Belgium and eventually relocated to the Renton office. She is currently the director of organized play and trade marketing. 






As [announced last December](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/122311a), Gen Con 2012 will host the first World **Magic** Cup, a competition that will offer the opportunity to teams from more than seventy countries to battle for the title of top **Magic** nation for 2012.

Starting April 14, three selected stores in participating countries will each run a World **Magic** Cup Qualifier. These three qualifiers will take place on different weekends to offer more opportunities for players to qualify. Due to scheduling conflicts, two of the three qualifiers in Japan will happen the same weekend.

Along with granting invitations to the World **Magic** Cup, our goal with these qualifiers is to offer "bigger than local" **Magic** events to players from all over the world. We are partnering closely with the selected stores and the judge community to meet this goal.

In many cities, the stores will run two-day events with the World **Magic** Cup Qualifier on the first day and a PTQ or a variety of tournaments on the second day. Kiev, Cadiz, Barcelona, Madrid, Nottingham, Pretori, Bucharest, Budapest, Bjelovar, Moscow, Milan, and Paris are just a few locations where you can expect to see this level of tournament activity.

The three stores in Australia even went a step further and decided to partner to complement their respective program: Good Games Brisbane is planning a huge Legacy event on its second day, Good Games Melbourne has opted for a PTQ, and Good Game Sydney will hold a PTQ and a Legacy event. This is just a glimpse at the fully packed schedules these stores are developing.

Almost all World **Magic** Cup qualifiers are now scheduled; I would therefore encourage you to use the locator to the right to find the dates and locations of the qualifiers for your country. You will also find contact information for each organizer so you can find out about his or her full schedule of events.

Please also keep in mind that in order to be able to participate in a World **Magic** Cup Qualifier, you need to have accrued [a certain number of Planeswalker Points](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/event/worldmagiccup/qualifiers#countries) by April 1. Points from all **Magic** events up through that date will count in your total regardless of when the event is reported; just verify that all your events are reported before the World **Magic** Cup qualifier you plan to attend.

That leaves you a few more days to get the points you might miss, including three Grand Prix and lots of side events! To see your Planeswalker Points total to see if you're qualified and where you rank among players from your country, visit the Planeswalker Points Leaderboard page, click on the Yearly tab, and select your country from the “Nationality” dropdown on the left side of the page. If you aren't listed in your correct country, [contact Wizards of the Coast Game Support here](https://accounts.wizards.com/amlogin.aspx?p_next_page=ask) with "Residential Eligibility Appeal" in the subject line.

We hope to see many of you attending a World **Magic** Cup qualifier and are looking forward to reading your stories and reports! We also encourage you to share your feedback and questions regarding World **Magic** Cup Qualifiers on Twitter [@HeleneBergeot](https://twitter.com/#!/@helenebergeot).
