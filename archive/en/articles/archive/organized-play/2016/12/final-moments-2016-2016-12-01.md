2016 has certainly been an interesting year, and starting today, we're less than one month away from closing it out as we move into 2017. For those with Pro Tour aspirations, this means only a few more opportunities remain in 2016 to qualify for *Magic*'s big tournament series.


Many will be traveling to a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier this weekend and the next for a shot at qualifying for Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*, which takes place in Dublin, Ireland, February 3–5, 2017. Others will be competing in one of 2016's last Grand Prix, which all qualify for Pro Tour *Amonkhet* in Nashville, Tennessee, May 12–14, 2017.


This Month's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers
=========================================


The next round of [Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers (RPTQs)](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/rptqaer) take place this weekend, as qualified players will compete for invitations and airfare to Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*. These events take place in select cities all over the world for two weekends, hosted by local game stores, and are free to enter for anyone who is qualified to participate.


The most common way of qualifying for players was through a Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier during this round, which ran from July 23 to October 9 earlier this year. However, players are also invited if they finished in the Top 8 of the last round of Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers or have achieved Silver level in the [Pro Tour Players Club](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/playersclub/standings). Players will also have one last opportunity to qualify in Last Chance Qualifiers, which take place the day before the RPTQ at the location of the big event.


All players that participate in a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier for this round will receive a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) promo card. This is also the last RPTQ round that awards the [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) promo!


Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers for *Aether Revolt* will also take place the weekend of December 11. In the event you're qualified for this round but are unable to travel to a physical tournament, *Magic Online* will also provide you an opportunity to qualify for the Pro Tour. The *Magic Online* RPTQs for this round take place on December 10 at 2 p.m. PT and December 17 at 5 a.m. PT. Please note that *Magic Online* RPTQs are a bit different from face-to-face RPTQs, so check the [RPTQ event information page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/rptqaer) for more information.


The format for these RPTQs is Modern Constructed, and we'll be posting decklists from the top finishing players both next week and the week after in this column.


Not qualified for this round, but looking to qualify for the next set of Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers? Then look for a [Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier for Pro Tour *Amonkhet*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/pptqakh) near you and maybe we'll see you in Nashville for the Pro Tour!


2016's Last Grand Prix
======================


We have two more weeks of Grand Prix in 2016. Two events take place this weekend, and one takes place next weekend.


First up are [Grand Prix Madrid](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpmad16) and [Denver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpden16), taking place December 2–4 and featuring Standard Constructed main events. While Madrid will be covered through non-video content via our European writer-reporters, Denver will feature live round-by-round video coverage along with traditional text coverage.

And finally, 2016 will close out with [Grand Prix Milwaukee](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpmil16), a *Kaladesh* Limited excursion December 9–11 that is sure to excite many fans of the 40-card formats. We'll be providing non-video coverage for this show with Marc Calderaro and Corbin Hosler bringing you the latest stories, so check back during that weekend for the latest.


2016 is nearly done, and we've got a very exciting 2017 to look forward to. For those competing in some of this year's final opportunities to qualify for the Pro Tour, all the best!
