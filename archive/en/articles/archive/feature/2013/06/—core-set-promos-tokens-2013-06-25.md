The ***Magic** 2014—Core Set* preview week is just around the corner. With ***Magic** 2014—Duels of the Planeswalkers* releasing tomorrow I figure it is about time to give you the run down of what promos and tokens are coming up. Let's dive into the promo cards because there are a few surprises in there!


First up are the three promos in the ***Magic** 2014—Duels of the Planeswalkers* promotional booster packs. Read [the original arcana](/en/node/649246) we announced them in to learn more.

These look interesting! A 1/1 red Elemental isn't something you see everyday.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1262_tok_saproling.jpg)I can't help but look at this guy now and think about *Modern Masters*, but I have no doubt I'll see this guy some in ***Magic** 2014*.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1262_tok_sliver.jpg)Here's the non-promo Sliver token.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1262_tok_wolf.jpg)Another well-known face, always glad to see him back!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1262_tok_zombie.jpg)BRRRRAAAAIIIIINNNNNNNNNS!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1262_tok_dragon.jpg)And lastly, a firebreathing Dragon!


And lastly there are two emblems in this set. One from a Planeswalker you already know, and one some of you were introduced to yesterday after a post on MTVGeek!
