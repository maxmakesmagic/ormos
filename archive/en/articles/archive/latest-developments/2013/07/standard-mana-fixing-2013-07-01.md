One of the most important questions for developers when dealing with Standard is what the mana base looks like. While it is very easy to play monocolored decks with nothing but basics, it gets progressively harder the more colors you add. One of the things we like about Standard is that we can shape the threats and answers in the format and let the format change and evolve to new threats. That movement, though, needs a strong enough mana base that decks targeted at the current metagame don't lose to their own mana as much as to their opponents' decks.
