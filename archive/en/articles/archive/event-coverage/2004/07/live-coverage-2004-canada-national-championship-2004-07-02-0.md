![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat04/dr1_1.jpg)Mark Zajdner is probably best known for his lack of an Inside Voice. After doing no testing, Zajdner and visiting ex-American Champ Josh Wagener decided that he should play mono-black in anticipation of a huge blue-white presence this weekend. That intuition paid off big time, handing him a 3-0 performance in the first half of Day 1. Now he just needs to draft a spicy deck and he'll be well on his way to making Top 8 this weekend. Zajdner is confident of his chances. He's constantly drafting on Magic Online, and has played with *Fifth Dawn* a fair amount.


He was seated between Jason Howden and Francis Cormier and commented that the table was one to be respected. His first pack gave him the choice between [Spikeshot Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) and [Betrayal of Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal+of+Flesh) and he took the full time alloted before settling on the Goblin. Next up was [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter), and then [Deconstruct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deconstruct) (over [Granite Shard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Shard)). The packs started getting thin right away. After a [Silver Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr) he took a pair of [Krark-Clan Grunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Grunt)s, and then took a few artifact lands (one over [Tel-Jilad Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Exile), a card Zajdner hates).


Unfortunately for him, Cormier had first-picked a Longbow over [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter), and then proceeded directly to red after a third-pick Spikeshot. Worse, Howden had his eyes on red as well. As a result, *Darksteel* did not go well. Zajdner's first two picks were [Spawning Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawning+Pit) and [Arcbound Slith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Slith) out of a pair of underwhelming packs. He got a Morningstar, but then got sent [Echoing Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay), [Chittering Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chittering+Rats) and [Screams from Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screams+from+Within) and resigned himself to playing swamps. He rounded things out with [Tanglewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tanglewalker), [Viridian Acolyte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Acolyte) and then [Tangle Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Spider) and hoped for the best.


Sadly *Fifth Dawn* was not coming to his rescue. He got a pair of [Vulshok Sorcerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Sorcerer)s early despite a hiccup with a [Goblin Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Brawler) while he watched [Vedalken Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles) go by. [Skyreach Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyreach+Manta) hit his pile fourth, but that was it as far as it went for exciting cards. The rest of his draft saw him pass [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) and [Thought Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Courier) while he stocked up on Grey Ogres. The only green cards he saw were [Tyrranax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tyrranax) and a lot of [Tel-Jilad Lifebreather](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Lifebreather)s.


Putting the cards out in front of him for deck construction, Zajdner was struck by how miserable his deck was. He left his [Deconstruct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deconstruct) and green filler in the board and threw out all his red and black cards. It totalled twenty-two, and that included such hits as [Paradise Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradise+Mantle). After [Deconstruct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deconstruct) brought him up to twenty-three, he couldn't find another card to include. He decided to run it with seventeen lands, but knew he was headed for an 0-3 performance. He conceded that if he got a lucky [Skyreach Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyreach+Manta) draw, or Spikeshot-Morningstar, he might be able to steal a match.
