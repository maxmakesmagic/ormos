What is your favorite keyword (or ability word) of all time, and why?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** There are a lot of runners-up that it pains me to pass over—convoke, graft, and exalted, to name a few—but ultimately for me there's one clear winner: cascade.

Cascade's impact on tournament Constructed has been, paradoxically, mostly about consistency. Decks in larger formats (like Legacy and the newly anointed [Modern format](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/155)) sometimes use cheap cascade cards to cheat out the *Time Spiral* free spells (most notably [Hypergenesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypergenesis) and [Living End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End)). And in smaller formats like Standard, decks used powerful cascade spells (mainly [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) and [Bituminous Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bituminous+Blast)) to ensure that each of their spells was (at least) two spells, which is pretty powerful, I hear.

But in Limited and Commander, where I do most of my playing (and where multiples of cards are not the norm), cascade is all about randomness. I'm a diversity gamer, and a cascade spell is different every time I cast it. Cast a spell and spin the wheel—good or bad, it's always exciting!
