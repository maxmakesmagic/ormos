Daniel Gräfensteiner (Tempered Steel) vs. Jeremy Neeman (Tempered Steel)
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Both Daniel Gräfensteiner and Jeremy Neeman showed up to this round with 9-3 records piloting the fearsome [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) deck. With just four rounds to go in the event, either one of these players could go on a run and earn himself his second Pro Tour Top 8. (Gräfensteiner made the Top 8 at San Diego last year, while Jeremy Neeman made it to the elimination rounds in San Juan just a few months later.)


### Game 1


Gräfensteiner won the roll and opened with [Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) and a [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite), while Neeman deployed a [Signal Pest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest). Gräfensteiner cast a second [Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) and then used a [Dispatch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispatch) to make sure he wouldn't take any hits from Neeman's [Porcelain Legionnaire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire).


A [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) for Gräfensteiner made his air force even more fearsome, while Neeman attempted to mount an offense of his own with [Blade Splicer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+Splicer). However, Gräfensteiner's next attack put Neeman on 9 and notched his own life total up to 23.

A [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) for Neeman set up an attack with [Signal Pest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest), [Blade Splicer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+Splicer), and a golem token that knocked Gräfensteiner down to 13, but even with the ability to attack for huge chunks of damage at a time, Neeman needed to draw something fast in order to stop Gräfensteiner's aerial assault.


Neeman used a [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) to take out Gräfensteiner's [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk), but between the life that he paid to cast [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) and the attack Neeman, he found himself on a meager 2 life.


Neeman played a second [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) and attacked with all of his creatures, but Gräfensteiner had enough chump-blockers to survive the attack, allowing him to then swing in for lethal in the air.


Gräfensteiner 1, Neeman 0


### Game 2


Neeman opened the second game with a couple of [Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge)s and a couple of [Origin Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin+Spellbomb)s, while Gräfensteiner had a [Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge), a [Spined Thopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Thopter) and a turn-three [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel).

After taking a big hit from Gräfensteiner's [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel)–enhanced army, Neeman attacked with two [Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge)s and a Myr token, only to see them all fall to a [Marrow Shards](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marrow+Shards) from the tapped-out Gräfensteiner.


Neeman's [Hero of Bladehold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) got [Dispatch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispatch)ed, and while Neeman was able to get his opponent's [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) off the board thanks to [Leonin Relic-Warder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Relic-Warder), he was unable to answer Gräfensteiner's fliers. A blank draw from Neeman later and Gräfensteiner was able to win his second game in a row with his fliers.
