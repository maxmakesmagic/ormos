The impact *Shards of Alara* would have on the new Extended format had been much talked about coming in to the weekend. As the current round finishes in the background, it has become clear what level that impact has been: profound.


Perhaps the most important card to come from the set so far has been [Wild Nacatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl). The unassuming 1/1 receives a huge power boost in Extended where it's joined by *Onslaught*'s sac lands and *Ravnica*'s dual lands. Combined, they allow [Wild Nacatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) to easily attack as a 3/3 on the second turn of play. That means Zoo players the world over have a new weapon to add to their arsenal after losing Gaea's Might to the set rotation. Without a doubt, Zoo is the runaway hit of the weekend popularity-wise, making up nearly a third of the field with 126 players (27.75%) playing a version of the deck.

The second most popular strategy and one of the biggest fan favorites so far is undoubtedly Elves, a combo deck that just happens to be able to Red Zone it up with its combo pieces. Players around the venue have been seen using [Glimpse of Nature](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+of+Nature) to play an obscene amount of Elves in a single turn. When you add [Heritage Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid) and Birchlore Ranger to that mixture, you also get a huge amount of mana. From there, players can kill with nearly anything they choose. [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot), [Brain Freeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze), even [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) for [Predator Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator+Dragon) have been used to go lethal as early as the third turn. In total 71 players, 15.64% of the field, opted to run the iconic green tribe this weekend.

Rounding up the top five are Storm, Next Level Blue(s), and Junk. Storm decks vary in makeup, with some builds including *Shards* standout [Ad Nauseam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam), other builds incorporating the [Pyromancer's Swath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath) / [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) combo, or straight-up [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) / [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) builds. They've proven to be very popular despite lots of flexible hate existing for them.

Next Level Blue, generally described as a blue control deck running [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and some form of creature control by way of [Threads of Disloyalty](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty) or [Vedalken Shackles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles) (and sometimes both), has remained popular despite losing [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) from last season. Thirty-two players have brought the deck to battle, including some big names from the professional community.


Rounding out the most popular strategies are various green-white-black "Junk" decks. The decks almost universally benefit from [Doran, the Siege Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower) and feature such hits as [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), and [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy). The big question for the 27 players using the strategy is whether their "old-fashioned" form of disruption will be enough to get them through a field of aggressive combo and aggro strategies.


Here's how the entire field broke down:
