GRAND PRIX HELSINKI 2004
------------------------


Ruel Rules over Helsinki
========================




November 5-7












Olivier Ruel is the 2004 Grand Prix Helsinki Champion!
------------------------------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gphels05/win.jpg)Ruel proved he was more than just a pretty face by overcoming great adversity to make the Top 8, then took everything with his monstrous color-splash draft deck by annihilating his way to the top.


Ruel took home the big money, a shiny card mounted in plastic, and official bragging rights as the 2004 Grand Prix-Helsinki Champion, perhaps indicating that although he's known as something of a joker, when it comes to winning Olivier Ruel is all business.

Helsinki is not the cheapest place to get to for most of Europe but there are still plenty of big name players to keep an eye on. It's been a lean period for Kai Budde of late, but only a fool would count out the German Juggernaut. Both of the Ruel brothers are here, but that isn't too surprising, they'd probably turn out if there was a GP in Antartica. Jelger Wiegersma from the Netherlands has a very strong Grand Prix Pedigree in Europe. The Scandinavians may not have been too enthusiastic about Columbus but Anton Jonsson, Matthias Jorstedt and PT New Orleans 2003 winner Rickard Österberg are players with a good chance to make an impact here.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gphels05/b1.jpg)Possibly the most famous name from the host nation is Tommi Hovi. Hovi was the first ever player to win two Pro Tours. While he doesn't play as much now he still managed a runner-up finish in last year's GP Göteborg. Tommi Wallamies, Tuomo Nieminen and Arho Toikka were part of the 2003 Finnish national team that nearly took the tam title at Worlds that year.


This year's national team comprised of current champion Jussi Timonen (pictured), MaX Lehtinen and Andrei Häyrynen. Häyrynen also managed to a 22nd place finish at the last Pro Tour in Columbus. Slightly ahead of him in 18th place was countryman Antti Malin.
