Hey there, Planeswalkers! It's me, Mr. The Wizard. Welcome to my neighborhood! There's all kinds of **Magic** players here, each of whom can teach us something about the game. If you're a new player, you'll learn a lot about the Sealed Deck format from expert Ben Stark. If you love competition, you'll enjoy seeing the best players compete to become a Grand Prix champion. If you like flavor, you might like imagining your favorite characters brawling against each other! What can you teach your neighbors about **Magic**?
