Here's the art description for [Nature's Spiral](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Spiral).


> Action: This is a symbolic representation of rebirth: Amid a patch of ferns, we see an extreme closeup of a trio of fern "fiddleheads," the curled-up fronds of a young fern. But these fiddleheads have taken on curled-up creature shapes -- a snake, a nautilus, and a human embryo.  
>  Focus: the fiddleheads  
>  Mood: Symbolic of renewed life of all kinds

It's a particular kind of spiral calculated from a logarithm related to the Golden Ratio. Since we're talking about art here, we won't go into the math. The point is that golden spirals appear in nature, from sunflowers to the arms of spiral galaxies.

Okay, now we're ready to look at the art for [Nature's Spiral](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Spiral), because Terese Nielsen did something pretty cool with this piece.

This might be a good time to point out the flavor text as well.



> *Like nature, the fern spirals back on itself, eternally seeking its own center.*
