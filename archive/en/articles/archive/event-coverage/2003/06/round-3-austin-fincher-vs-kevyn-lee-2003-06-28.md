![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natus03/a827.jpg)Austin qualified in Louisiana at a JSS Challenge. He's been playing for the last three years, having started with Invasion. He's playing a Blue-Green madness deck that features the semi-rare choice of [Hapless Researcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapless+Researcher) as an additional madness engine. Kevyn won a JSS Qualifier that took place in Las Vegas. He's been playing around two years, having started with *Odyssey*. Kevyn brought along good old Red-Green beats for this event. 

### Game 1

"I'm good," Austin said. "I'll keep," Kevyn responded. A turn one [Hapless Researcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapless+Researcher) from Austin started the game. Kevyn placed his own creature on the table, going with [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) on turn one. Both players then added [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla)s to the table.

"Attack," Austin said, as he turned the [Hapless Researcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapless+Researcher) and the Rootwalla sideways, sending them into the Red Zone. The Rootwallas held a bloody exchange in the middle of the table, with both headed to their respective graveyards. Both players added more creatures to their table. An [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) and [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) for Austin, a [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd) token for Kevyn. The real problem was the [Elephant Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Guide) sitting on that elephant token. Austin solved that problem with a [Roar of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) token.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natus03/a826.jpg)The creature standoff continued. Kevyn added a [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) to the table, then a second one, but he didn't turn them sideways. For some reason his horde of double Centaur and 6/6 Elephant was being kept at bay by a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and a Wurm token. Kevyn added a second [Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call) token, and put a second copy of [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd) in his graveyard. As well as the army of green beasts he had on the table he still had access to two more elephants because of the flashback ability of the [Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call).

Austin can only come up with a second [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel), and the table was badly balanced against him. His frown turned upside-down moments later though, as he mised into [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) to win the game.

Austin Fincher 1 – Kevyn Lee 0

Austin started into his sideboard immediately, digging for some anti Red-Green tech. He pondered and pondered, wondering what cards in his sideboard could help him take Game 2 and end this match. He removed three copies of [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and an [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm), adding three [Callous Oppressor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Callous+Oppressor)s and an [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) in their places. Kevyn quickly and methodically ripped some cards from his deck, removing two [Sylvan Safekeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Safekeeper)s and a single copy of [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd), replacing them with three copies of [Ensnaring Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge).

### Game 2

The two players were relatively silent until Kevyn made his play/draw decision. "I'll play," he decided. A moment later he also decided to keep his opening hand.

"I'm good," Austin announced as well.

Early creatures from both sides hit the table. Rootwalla from Kevyn was met by [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) from Austin. The creatures were rendered moot moments later though when Kevyn played an [Ensnaring Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge). The sideboard was at work, as the bridge holds back the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) and the [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) that Austin had played.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natus03/a828.jpg)A [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) from Austin put three copies of [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) in the graveyard. People around the feature match area were speculating that he planned on making Kevyn draw all those cards, just to get around the [Ensnaring Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge). The flaw in this plan was simple though, Kevyn could just dump those cards to the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel).

The plan worked out though a moment later. Austin cast [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) on the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel), making Kevyn pick up his little card dumper.

Austin then flashed back all three copies of [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Kevyn now had way too many cards in his hand for the [Ensnaring Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge) to save him. Two [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm)s, a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and a [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) were able to combine with the cards left in Austin's hand to finish this match.

**Final Result:** Austin Fincher 2 – Kevyn Lee 0
