**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


-


**What deck are you playing and why?**


Maverick. I knew going in that I was playing a Thalia deck, and decided on Maverick over Death & Taxes because I like its Delver match-up better. Also it’s just super fun.


**What was your best card this weekend and why?**


[Ramunap Excavator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramunap+Excavator). I don’t think I lost a game when it resolved. Recurring [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s and Horizon Canopies is incredibly powerful!


**What do you enjoy most about Legacy?**


Everything. Legacy is basically the only format I play, and I really can’t say enough good things about it, so I’ll just say that Thalia is better here than anywhere else.


**What would winning the Grand Prix mean to you?**


A lot. I’ve definitely had dreams about it.

**What deck are you playing and why?**


Sultai Leovold. I think the deck has a chance against everything. Feels like the old Jund Modern with [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman).

I always say Legacy is my worst format. In Limited I have a chance, but in Legacy, it would be crazy.
