In his [article](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mr12) on Monday, Mark referred to a "cool little trick" that involved the flavor text of [Awakening](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening). Well, here it is.


The flavor text from Awakening ends with the word "Charge," which is also the first word in the flavor text for another *Stronghold* card, [Primal Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Rage). On purpose? Of course!


[Awakening](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening)'s text is the tail end of a rallying speech [Eladamri, Lord of Leaves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Eladamri%252C%2BLord%2Bof%2BLeaves) is making to the elves and Vec before they storm the [Volrath's Stronghold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Volrath%2527s%2BStronghold)â€¦ and [Primal Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Rage) shows the army responding to Eladamri's orders. These two cards are the only instance of connected flavor text linked by a common word.
