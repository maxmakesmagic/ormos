An awful lot of Izzet cards seem to take place in laboratories. For example, take [Thoughtflare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtflare) and [Downsize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Downsize).

Those laboratories look pretty cool. Maybe we could get a good look at them if the art were bigger?

Okay. That's *pretty* cool. But you know what would be even cooler? Seeing an Izzet lab without anything going on it? That would really convey the Izzet aesthetic, right? Well, good news! The *Return to Ravnica* Style Guide has a few unoccupied Izzet laboratories we can look at!
