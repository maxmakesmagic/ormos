![9757](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=9757)**[The Ultimate Nightmare of Wizards of the Coast® Customer Service](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=9757)** – *Unglued* uncommon. The phone number in the flavor text of [The Ultimate Nightmare of Wizards of the Coast® Customer Service](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Ultimate+Nightmare+of+Wizards+of+the+Coast%C2%AE+Customer+Service) is no longer accurate. But in the United States and Canada, (800) 324-6496 will work. Outside those countries, use (425) 204-8069 or go to [wizards.custhelp.com](http://wizards.custhelp.com).
 ![The Iron Guardian Stirs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=The+Iron+Guardian+Stirs)**[The Iron Guardian Stirs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Iron+Guardian+Stirs)** – *Archenemy* scheme. You know, it's not really all that evil to have a golem standing by in case you're attacked. In a way, most Archenemy players are being ganged up on unfairly! That's "players who are playing the Archenemy," not "anybody playing *Archenemy*," if you see what we mean.
 ![Heroic Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Heroic+Defiance)**[Heroic Defiance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroic+Defiance)** – *Planeshift* common. This somewhat complicated mechanic appeared on two cards in *Invasion* ([Barrin's Unmaking](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrin%27s+Unmaking) and [Tsabo's Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo%27s+Assassin)) and made a reappearance in *Planeshift* on [Heroic Defiance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroic+Defiance).
 ![Bronze Calendar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bronze+Calendar)**[Bronze Calendar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Calendar)** – *Unglued* uncommon. The art for [Bronze Calendar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Calendar) actually shows a bronze *colander*, which is a reference to the times that artists have misunderstood what they're supposed to draw. Examples include [Hyalopterous Lemure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hyalopterous+Lemure) and [Alchor's Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alchor%27s+Tomb), which was supposed to be a tome.
 ![9847](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=9847)**[Karn, Silver Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=9847)** – *Urza's Saga* rare. Before appearing as the Planeswalker [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated), Karn was a commonplace creature. The other Planeswalkers that first appeared as creatures are [Venser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser) and [Nicol Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=178020).
 ![Zuberi, Golden Feather](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zuberi%2C+Golden+Feather)**[Zuberi, Golden Feather](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zuberi%2C+Golden+Feather)** – *Mirage* rare. There were actually four non-Zuberi Griffins in *Mirage*, including a mini-combo involving the sacrifice of [Unyaro Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3519), which could be brought back with [Mtenda Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mtenda+Griffin).
 ![Guma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Guma)**[Guma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guma)** – *Urza's Saga* uncommon. You can see from the art and flavor text that the [Guma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guma) likes to hunt at the edge of the water. This makes sense for a creature with protection from blue, since it has nothing to fear from even the toothiest shark.
 ![Assault Zeppelid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Assault+Zeppelid)**[Assault Zeppelid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Zeppelid)** – *Dissension* common. In their natural form, Zeppelids are blue-aligned creatures. But the Simic mages have grafted green magic into this one to make it more warlike. You can see the pure blue version on [Stratozeppelid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratozeppelid).
 ![Mesa Chicken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mesa+Chicken)**[Mesa Chicken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Chicken)** – *Unglued* common. The art for [Mesa Chicken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Chicken) represents Kev Walker's interpretation of the instruction to create a real, yet majestic, chicken.
 ![Devout Harpist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Devout+Harpist)**[Devout Harpist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devout+Harpist)** – *Urza's Legacy* common. We can't improve on this [comment by **tavaritz**](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Discussion.aspx?multiverseid=12813): This was the 200th **Magic** card which name started with D if we count the *Urza's Legacy* cards in alphabetical order. If in collector's number order then it's [Defense Grid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defense+Grid).
 ![11315](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=11315)**[Grizzly Bears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=11315)** – *Seventh Edition* common. After illustrations by Jeff A. Menges and Una Fricker, [Grizzly Bears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=11315) got an illustration by D. J. Cleland-Hura, which is the art it stuck with for the rest of its stay in the core set. That stay ended in *Tenth Edition*, since [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) took its place starting in ***Magic** 2010*.
 ![Creepy Doll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Creepy+Doll)**[Creepy Doll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creepy+Doll)** – *Innistrad* rare. [Creepy Doll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creepy+Doll) fact one: The original art was [given away](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/twtw/153) at the 2011 San Diego Comic Con. Fact two: The background doll shows up [on Kindercatch](/en/articles/archive/what-kinder-caught-2011-10-18). Fact three: [Mark Rosewater says](/en/articles/archive/scary-stories-part-1-2011-09-19) it's based on a Jonathan Coulton song.
 ![Uktabi Wildcats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Uktabi+Wildcats)**[Uktabi Wildcats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Wildcats)** – *Seventh Edition* rare. Both [Uktabi Wildcats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Wildcats) and [Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) base their toughness directly on something else, as opposed to cards like [Lhurgoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lhurgoyf) that add one. So the controller of [Uktabi Wildcats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Wildcats) could sacrifice a Forest to regenerate it but inadvertently reduce its toughness to zero!
