Day 1 Coverage



504 teams, 1,512 players, came to Liverpool to show their mastery of Modern. After the first day's eight rounds, only 67 teams remained in the running. Leading the charge into Sunday were Francisco Sanchez, Mattia Rizzi, and Cristian Ortiz, as well as Niels Molle, Piotr Głogowski, and Joao Choca.


These six would have a head start over the competition on Day 2, but said competition was fierce. The team of Thiago Rodrigues, Eduardo Sajgalik, and Jérémy Dezani, as well as Ondřej Stráský, Alexander Hayne, and Jason Chung, to drop but a few big names, all managed to go 7-1.


With a cast like that and spells being cast as typical for Modern, this promised another exciting and entertaining day. Join us then for all the latest and all the action, straight from the battlefield of Grand Prix Liverpool 2018!
