Ian Duke is a developer in Magic R&D and has been with Wizards of the Coast since 2012. A gift of an Ice Age starter deck in 1995 sparked Ian's lifelong passion for Magic. He also enjoys math, physics, board games, and puzzles. To the surprise of few, his favorite guild is Azorius. 






**Announcement Date**: October 7, 2019


No changes to any formats.


The list of all banned and restricted cards, by format, is [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/banned-restricted).
