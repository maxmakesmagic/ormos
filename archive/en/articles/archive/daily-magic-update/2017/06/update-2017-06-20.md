Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on June 20, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by my soon-to-be-wife, Shawna. I'll be taking the rest of this week off (and much of next week) from the Daily *Magic* Update and basically anything resembling work. Nick Wolfram will take over Update duties in the meantime.


Now on to previews!

Ah, poor Neheb. Once Minotaur champion of the heckbent, now Eternal and slave of Bolas. At least Minotaur tribal continues to get more entries into its ledger—even when those entries are Zombies.

Powerful graveyard hate for everyone—in Desert form!


What? You can't read Spanish? Man, I have to do everything. And by everything I mean [someone else translated it and I am linking to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6idpp6/hou_spoiler_scavenger_grounds/dj5dhzb/). I don't speak Spanish either. Just a little German. And, very helpfully, some Latin.

Time to learn Spanish!

Another stellar entry into the world of painful-looking heads with hands reaching for them to calm whatever is driving them mad. The video has English subtitles, so you can watch it without much difficulty, but there's also an [easy internet translation here](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6iel7k/hou_fraying_sanity_diario_planinauta_spoiler/dj5knll/).

Ah, yes. Feel the hate flow through you with these two cards previewed by Seth (probably better known as SaffronOlive).


As a bonus, they're in English. No translation necessary!


1. What Else to Watch for Today

A few more cards may squirm their way into the public today (depending on your time zone). Watch for a group of five cards coming from Australia, another coming out of China, and possibly an update from the [UK version of Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.co.uk/).


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. Team Draft Super League | [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) | 4:45 p.m. PT/7:45 p.m. ET/11:45 p.m. UTC

Not only do you get some more hot, hot Team Draft action, but this is happening as well:



> 
> Scholarship winners for 2017-2018 will be announced Tuesday on the Team Draft Super League broadcast. Pre-game starts at 7:45 (et)!

Come for the drafting, stay for helping the future get there without mountains of debt.


Top 25
======


1. Three Grand Prix change Top 25 up and down

Despite nearly everyone changing places, not a single player dropped out of the Top 25, which is impressive. There were also very few large gains—the three-spot jumps of Brian Braun-Duin and Lukas Blohon were the largest rises—and just two large drops.


Reid Duke picked up a few points and is now No. 3 with a bullet, though Márcio Carvalho still has a stranglehold on No. 1.

Kelly Digges and Alison Luhrs, setting the record straight. We are returning to Dominaria, but the set name is very much just *Dominaria*.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Oketra's Tokens](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/6i3rqe/standard_my_take_on_oketras_monument_followup/)

This deck has been floating around the internet for about a week or so as players begin to discover a Standard without [Aetherworks Marvel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel)—and it turns out [Oketra's Monument](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oketra%27s+Monument) is the real deal.


Of all the decks I've tested for the Deck of the Day (and, yes, sarcastic person in the back, I play most of these myself for at least a match or five), this is the one I'm most surprised I thoroughly enjoyed. White decks that are mostly creatures really aren't my thing—but there is a lot going on in this one.


Let's start with the Monument itself. The tokens add up quickly, as does the discount on every single one of your creatures. You also can end up with more Clues than you can use thanks to unsung hero [Bygone Bishop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bygone+Bishop), and way more tokens than your opponents can handle thanks to [Hanweir Militia Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanweir+Militia+Captain).


In one match I played yesterday, a Zombie deck got a blisteringly fast start on the play and knocked me all the way down to 1 life by turn four. But thanks to a third-turn Monument followed up by two [Hanweir Militia Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanweir+Militia+Captain)s and a [Fairgrounds Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fairgrounds+Warden), I was never really in danger of dying again. It took about ten turns, but eventually a flipped [Westvale Abbey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Westvale+Abbey) finished things off.


It also happens to be an incredible [Dusk // Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+%2F%2F+Dawn) deck. In fact, I'd probably try to find room for a third [Dusk // Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+%2F%2F+Dawn) in the sideboard.


The deck is still developing as people refine it, so play with it a bit and see what you enjoy about it. I know I will be.
