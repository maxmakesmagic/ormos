*DailyMTG is catching you up on some of the best articles from the past year while our whole crew enjoys the holidays. We’re replaying some of our authors' most popular works and some of your favorites December 15–26, but don’t be surprised if we have a special present or two for you somewhere during the holidays…*

By the time this article goes live, we'll be close to wrapping up Day Two of the [2014 World Championship](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2014WC). Have you been watching the coverage? If not, I strongly advise doing so if you're interested in seeing the Top 4 players who will be competing on Sunday, because that should be happening sometime soon. You can watch it live on the [*Magic* Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic). But hey, in case you're reading this later on Wednesday, the Day Two replay should be happening, so your trip over to Twitch certainly won't be wasted!

The week isn't over yet, either! The [2014 World *Magic* Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2014WMC) kicks off this Friday with live coverage beginning at 1 a.m. PT/4 a.m. ET/9 a.m. GMT/10 a.m. local time (CET). In it, 72 teams comprised of four players each will compete for fame, fortune, and national pride, and it is truly one of the greatest *Magic* events to watch all year. I'm excited to see it all get started!




The Flashback
=============



Last weekend featured Grand Prix in both North America and Europe.


![](http://wotc-mx1.bkom.com/sites/wotc-mx1.bkom.com/files/GP-City-Only-Strasbourg-Black%202.png)




In Europe, players gathered in Strasbourg, France, to compete in *Khans of Tarkir* Limited. Given the close proximity and low cost from Strasbourg to Nice, it was also a tournament featuring many players who are competing in some element of 2014 Worlds Week.



In fact, the Top 8 for the event included Worlds Week competitors such as 2014 World Championship player Kentaro Yamamoto, as well as Team Hungary's Tamas Nagy—who went on to win the event. A fine prelude to the World *Magic* Cup, and a victory Nagy would hope to repeat with his teammates after a very close strive toward the win in last year's team event.



Coverage can be found [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpstr14), but here a few highlights:



[Traveling the World/To Worlds](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpstr14/travelling-world-worlds-2014-11-30)—Coverage reporter Tobi Henke catches up with New Zealand World *Magic* Cup competitor Jason Chung, who made the trek to Grand Prix Strasbourg before finishing completing his trip to Nice.



[Collaborating for the World *Magic* Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpstr14/collaborating-world-magic-cup-2014-11-29)—Coverage reporter Olle Rade talks to a couple of World *Magic* Cup teams that are collaborating with other countries in preparation for the big event.

Meanwhile, players from North American gathered in San Antonio, Texas, to compete in two days of Standard Constructed, a format that has established itself as diverse and shifting from one week to the next. This was again shown to be evident with the Top 8 sporting seven distinct archetypes, with Abzan Midrange being the only archetype featured twice in the Top 8.



It was not, however, a feature in either of the finals decks; which featured the increasingly popular White-Blue Heroic deck as well as Mardu Midrange, one of the big hits of the weekend. And it was ultimately Ryan Scullin with Mardu who took down the finals and took home the trophy at the end of the event.



Full coverage can be found [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsna14), but here are a few highlights:



[Day Two Metagame Breakdown](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsna14/day2meta)—Given the ebb and flow of Standard each week, the Day Two Metagame Breakdown for this weekend paints an interesting picture of what the environment currently looks like. Given those numbers, four of the five clans represent a large chunk of the field, meaning that if you're playing tri-lands, you're likely playing a host of the best spells and creatures as well.



[World *Magic* Cup Captain and World Traveler](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsna14/captain)—Coverage reporter Marc Calderaro got a chance to catch up with one of the few World *Magic* Cup competitors to trek through San Antonio rather than Strasbourg: Marcelino Freeman, Mexico's team captain for the big event.
