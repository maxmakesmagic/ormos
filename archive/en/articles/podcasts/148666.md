**JANUARY BONUS EPISODE**


* It's time to move into the present -- an alternate reality present, that is. **Magic**creative director Brady Dommermuth talks about the new set and how the nostalgia of *Time Spiral* morphed into the twisted present of *Planar Chaos* He also shows a few pieces of art that provide clues to as-yet-unrevealed cards that the most astute **Magic** fans may be able to riddle out. If you don't have iTunes, you can see the images by [clicking here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/podcast/11a).
* So what is up with the color pie? Longtime R&D member Bill Rose and relative newcomer Devin Low discuss how design and development attacked the color shifting in *Planar Chaos*, including a color mechanic argument Bill's been having since his Alpha playtesting days. Want a preview card? [Watch the podcast in iTunes](http://phobos.apple.com/webobjects/mzstore.woa/wa/viewpodcast?id=80538924) to see one of the most controverisal cards in the set.
