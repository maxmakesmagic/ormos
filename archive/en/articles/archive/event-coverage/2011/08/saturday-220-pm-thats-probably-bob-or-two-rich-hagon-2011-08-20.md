Jeremy Paterson came here from Norwich with a plan to qualify in the Limited Last Chance Qualifier. Things went fairly well at first, coming out of the first draft at 2-1, and then getting a bye to take him to within two wins of the main event. That's where it all went wrong, and with the Standard LCQ already under way, Jeremy wouldn't be playing in Nationals this year.


"I knew there were going to be a lot of side events. Last year a good friend of mine came to Nationals and played two days of Commander non-stop. I really like the new Commander decks. They're well-balanced. I've started playing with [Riku of Two Reflections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riku+of+Two+Reflections) - he's just too much fun. It's always nice to end the turn twice, just in case!"


Paterson was contemplating playing in the Champions of Kamgawa APAC draft yesterday afternoon, until he heard about the Russian Ravnica draft taking place.


"I started playing back in 1997 when a friend introduced me to *Mirage*.


I stopped for a while, came back during *Mercadian Masques*, stopped for a while, and then got back into the game properly during *Time Spiral*.


Ironically, that meant that I didn't get to play with Ravnica at all first time around. I don't speak any Russian, but one of the judges did, so he was able to answer questions about what all the cards did."

Since the cards were written in Cyrillic, there were a lot of rules questions, but Jeremy was thrown something of a curveball when he opened his first pack.


"As I sat down, I thought how crazy it would be if I opened a foil [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant). I thought it was going to be Ravnica, *Guildpact*, *Dissension*, but then I found out that it was triple Ravnica. I remember thinking that now I had three chances to open one. And there it was in my very first pack."


[Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) has always been an incredibly popular card, combining iconic artwork, **Magic** history (it's a **Magic** Invitational winner card for Bob Maher Jr.) and awesome gameplay power. Now, with the upsurge in popularity for formats like Legacy, players are increasingly looking to make their decks look extra-special, and it doesn't get much more unique than a foil Russian [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant).


"Once I'd opened that, quite a lot of packs went by in a bit of a daze" Jeremy admits. "I just tried to pick the cards with wings on the picture, and hoped that all that Russian text didn't say things like 'sacrifice a creature' or 'all your lands'."


If we'd opened a foil Russian [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), we'd be reeling too.


Jeremy was inundated with requests for photos, and there was a lot of excitement around the room as the word spread. All in all, not a bad consolation for having missed out on the main event. As you can see, it really is a gorgeous card.
