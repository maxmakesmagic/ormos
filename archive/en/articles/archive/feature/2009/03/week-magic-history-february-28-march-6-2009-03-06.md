### March 3-5, 2006: Mark Herberholz wins Pro Tour–Honolulu!


Now that Pro Tour–Kyoto is over, it's time to think about Standard Pro Tours of years past. In 2006, [Honolulu was the site](/en/events/coverage/living-heezy-street) of Mark Herberholz's Gruul-fueled victory as he piloted a deck crafted at the now-legendary Beach House.

But that's not all that happened at Honolulu. Last weekend, Gabriel Nassif had possibly [the greatest topdeck](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/quarterfinals-ridiculous-2009-02-28) in Pro Tour history. The other candidate? Craig Jones's [semifinal rip](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/semifinals-topdeck-ages-2006-03-05) of a [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) against Olivier Ruel.


Wish you could have been there? The Pro Tour will be returning to Honolulu in June, and [qualifiers are still going on](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/honolulu09-qualifiers). Make your own mark on **Magic** history!
