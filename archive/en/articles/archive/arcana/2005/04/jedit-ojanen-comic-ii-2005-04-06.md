[Last week](/en/articles/archive/jedit-ojanen-comic-2005-03-29) we saw some scans from the 1996 comic, "Legend of [Jedit Ojanen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jedit+Ojanen)," issue 1 of 2. The *Legends*-era villain [Johan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Johan) had summoned a pack of nasty [Beasts of Bogardan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beasts+of+Bogardan) to shred [Jedit Ojanen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Jedit%2BOjanen) to ribbons.

The conclusion comes in issue 2:

Unsurprisingly, our hero Jedit takes out those pro-red [Beasts of Bogardan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Beasts%2Bof%2BBogardan) (which are probably a 4/4 due to Jedit's being a white permanent, but then, hey, [Jedit Ojanen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Jedit%2BOjanen) is 5/5). In fact, it's a rather gory scene that leaves the defeated beasts' heads at their master's feet:

The evil [Johan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Johan) escapes that battle -- temporarily. [Jedit Ojanen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jedit+Ojanen) goes on to aid the [Desert Nomads](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desert+Nomads) and seeks reinforcements against Lord [Johan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Johan) in the form of a tribe of [Cat Warriors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cat+Warriors). But [Johan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Johan) releases a skyful of [Granite Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Gargoyle)s! Does Jedit and his new crew have what it takes to defeat the villainous Lord [Johan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Johan)? 

Track down a copy of "Legend of Jedit Ojanen" to find out for sure, but we'll say this: Lord [Johan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Johan) has a lot to learn about a group of [Desert Nomads](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desert+Nomads) armed with an [Invisibility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invisibility) spell.
