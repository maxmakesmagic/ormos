Pioneering a New Ban Cadence
----------------------------


For the new Pioneer format, R&D has announced that all changes to the banned list will happen on Mondays. Since we know that many Pioneer fans play on *Magic Online*, we wanted to make it clear how this will work with *Magic Online* league play.


Until the Pioneer format is placed on the normal ban cadence, Pioneer bans will take effect the day after the announcement, at noon Pacific time on Tuesdays.


If a card is banned, players using the newly banned card in a league can finish their league courses up until the ban takes effect. At noon PT on Tuesday, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned, players will be able to join the Pioneer league with decks containing those cards after the changes are made effective at noon PT on Tuesday.


For more information about Pioneer, check out [Blake's announcement article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-pioneer-format-2019-10-21).

Pioneer Week Is Coming
----------------------


So many of you have taken the time and energy to speak out: you love Pioneer. And we think it's pretty great, too. In fact, we think it's so great that we want to celebrate its success with a big celebration.


This celebration begins on Monday, November 25 and lasts through Sunday: if you want to play Pioneer, we will have the event for you. We're adding eight more PTQs and moving some already scheduled elsewhere to make room. All week long, we're running at least one Pioneer PTQ. These PTQs are in a variety of time slots, so whatever your schedule is, we've probably got an event for you. The following events qualify for PT 2020 Series 1, and entry options are 30 Tickets or 300 Play Points:





| PTQ Finals Date | Start Time (UTC -8) | Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Friday, November 22 | 9 a.m. | Standard |
| Monday, November 25 | 5 a.m. | Pioneer |
| Tuesday, November 26 | 9 a.m. | Pioneer |
| Wednesday, November 27 | 3 p.m. | Pioneer |
| Thursday, November 28 | 6 a.m. | Pioneer |
| Friday, November 29 | 10 a.m. | Pioneer |
| Friday, November 29 | 11 p.m. | Pioneer |
| Saturday, November 30 | 7 a.m. | Pioneer |
| \*Sunday, December 1 | 6 a.m. | Pioneer |
| Friday, December 13 | 7 a.m. | ELD Sealed |


\***NOTE**: The December 1 PTQ pre-empt's that day's Pioneer Challenge event.

*Legacy Cube* Returns Tomorrow
------------------------------


The *Legacy Cube* returns starting tomorrow and will run until November 20! *Magic* R&D's Reggie Valk has this to say about the latest *Legacy Cube* update:


*"*Throne of Eldraine *has brought a lot of new cards that I'm excited to try in* Magic Online *Cubes, and the* Legacy Cube *is first in line. Adventure creatures like [Embereth Shieldbreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embereth+Shieldbreaker) and [Murderous Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Rider) are among the coolest new additions since they serve multiple roles with one card. Additionally, there's plenty of fun synergies to try for: [Garruk, Cursed Huntsman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Cursed+Huntsman) fueling 'Garruk tribal;' [Realm-Cloaked Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Realm-Cloaked+Giant) teaming up with the [Sun Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan) cycle; and my personal favorite: [Charming Prince](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charming+Prince) flickering [Thraben Inspector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Inspector) and [Wall of Omens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens). Overall, not a major overhaul to the* Legacy Cube *this time around, but enough is changed to get a good amount of Eldraine flavor into the mix. Have fun Cubing!"*

Banned & Restricted List Update Window
--------------------------------------


Next Monday, November 18, R&D will make an announcement regarding the banned and restricted lists for each format. If there is a change to any format, *Magic Online* will implement that change at 12 p.m. PT on the same day as the announcement.


If a card is banned or restricted, players using the newly banned card in a league can finish their league courses in the intervening four hours. At noon, however, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned or unrestricted, players can join existing leagues with decks containing those cards after the update.


**NOTE**: Pioneer bannings have a separate timing window for implementation. For more information, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/november-11-2019-pioneer-banned-announcement).
