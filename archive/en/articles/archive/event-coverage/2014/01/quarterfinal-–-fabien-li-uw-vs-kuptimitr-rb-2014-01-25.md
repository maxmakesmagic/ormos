Fabien is bringing a UW 'control' evasion deck while Kuptimitr is sporting a quick RB minotaurs tribal deck. Would Kuptimitr be able to close the games before Fabien stabilises?


**Game 1**


Both players were quick out of the gates. Kuptimitr with [Asphodel Wanderer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asphodel+Wanderer) and [Borderland Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Minotaur), and Fabien with [Cavalry Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalry+Pegasus) and [Meletis Charlatan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meletis+Charlatan).


When Fabien tapped out to bestow [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) on [Cavalry Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalry+Pegasus), it gave Kuptimitr the window of opportunity for a massive counterattack with [Kragma Warcaller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kragma+Warcaller) to take Fabien down to 10 life.


Fabien, however, appeared unperturbed and simply played [Chosen by Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chosen+by+Heliod) on Pegasus and [Leonin Snarecaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Snarecaster), before attacking with Pegasus and Charlatan.


Sensing a window to seal the game, Kuptimitr stole the Snarecaster with [Portent of Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Portent+of+Betrayal) and sent his team in for what he hoped to be the final alpha strike. Fabien, however, had the backbreaking [Triton Tactics](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Tactics) to gain sufficient tempo to take the game on the back of his lifelink flyer.

**Game 2**


Kuptimitr started on the backfoot with a pair of mulligans, but still managed [Ill-Tempered Cyclops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ill-Tempered+Cyclops) to Fabien's [Meletis Charlatan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meletis+Charlatan), [Wavecrash Triton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wavecrash+Triton) and [Leonin Snarecaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Snarecaster).


[Kragma Warcaller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kragma+Warcaller) again came down to take a hefty chuck out of Fabien's life total, but Fabien similarly had [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) on [Wavecrash Triton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wavecrash+Triton) to stabilise.


[Ember Swallower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Swallower) was similarly tapped by [Fate Foretold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Foretold) on Triton and [Dauntless Onslaught](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Onslaught) on the merfolk extended Fabien's lead.

At one life, Kuptimitr struggled to remain in the game by stealing the lifelink Triton with [Portent of Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Portent+of+Betrayal) and killing the Leonin with [Spark Jolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spark+Jolt). Fabien simply untapped and bestowed [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary) on the Triton.


**Fabien wins 2-0 and advances to the semi-finals.**
