Play *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* Now on All Platforms!
===============================================================


Dungeons, Classes, a Dragon God—all that and more are now playable on *MTG Arena* in *Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms*! Check out Jay Parker's [State of the Game article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-adventures-forgotten-realms-2021-07-02) for a closer look at what awaits you in the new set, as well as Jeremy Bower's [digital release notes covering the set](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-digital-release-notes-adventures-forgotten-realms-2021-07) for details on mechanics and more.


Brainstorm Suspended in Historic
================================


Beginning tomorrow, July 22, [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) is suspended in *MTG Arena*'s Historic format. [Read the suspension announcement](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/july-21-2021-banned-and-restricted-announcement) for full details.


Bug Fixes
=========


The Thursday, July 15, deployment resolved additional high-profile bugs that occurred with the *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* release:


* Fixed: A bug that caused swapped quests not to refresh visually.
* Fixed: Multiple translation issues, especially in Japanese. Note: there are still some translation issues that remain; we are working on delivering fixes for those soon.
* Fixed: A bug that caused logs not to populate with certain messages. This should allow third-party trackers to restore their lost functionality.
* Fixed: The emote selection screen that displayed as blank in some non-English languages.
* Fixed: A bug that could cause the wrong player to lose life from Check for Traps.
* Fixed: A bug that caused Sandfall Cell in the Tomb of Annihilation to count sacrificed permanents to prevent the life loss for their owner, not the controller.
* Fixed: A bug that could cause Mutual Destruction (*Ikoria*) not to gain flash when it should.
* Fixed: A bug that caused deck import to fail when trying to import a deck with "+2 Mace" in it.
* Emote stickers for *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* now properly fade out as they end, rather than popping out.
* Improved messaging on mobile when there is a new client required to play.

Midweek *Magic* Artisan Happening Now!
======================================


Midweek *Magic* is underway with Standard Artisan as the format! Standard Artisan is a Constructed format in which all Standard-legal cards used in your 60-card deck must be either common or uncommon rarity.


[Midweek *Magic* events](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-adventures-forgotten-realms-2021-07-02#midweekmagic) run weekly from Tuesday at 8 a.m. PT through Thursday at 8 a.m. PT with a different format each week. There is no entry fee, and you can earn two rare individual card rewards—just like FNM at Home.


Codes for an *MTG Arena* cosmetic are still available from your local game store (in person, if pandemic restrictions allow in your area, or online).
