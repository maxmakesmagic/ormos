Below, you can find the complete transcript of that interview.


**Brian Kibler:**   
 Hello everyone!


**Comment From ChampBlankman:**  
 Brian Kibler, how do you have time to sleep between testing ****Magic****, playing ****Magic****, jetting about the world for electronic dance music festivals, and designing your own games?


**Brian Kibler:**   
 It's hard to find the time to sleep, so I drink lots of caffeine :) . I've actually been on the road for two and a half weeks now. I'm getting home just in time for my birthday next week.


**Comment From Hugh:**  
 Hello Brian Kibler, how did you begin playing ****Magic**: the Gathering**?


**Brian Kibler:**   
 I played a ton of games as a kid, both video games as well as paper games like **Dungeons &amp; Dragons**. I went to a game convention and saw some people playing this cool looking card game, so I picked up some packs to try it, and then pretty much fell in love with it.


**Brian Kibler:**   
 That was about eighteen years ago!


**Comment From Ithilanor:**  
 Happy birthday!


**Brian Kibler:**   
 Thanks, though I'm past the age of even looking forward to cheaper car insurance. :-P


**Comment From Sean:**  
 @Brian Kibler, I enjoyed seeing you on Fantasy Factory. Anymore plans to be on  
 tv? The world needs more of you.


**Brian Kibler:**   
 I don't have any plans to return to TV soon, but I'd be happy to do it. [Clear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clear)ly we need a gamer reality TV show.


**Comment From Shane:**  
 Brian Kibler, If you could be one card (planeswalker or creature) what would you  
 be?


**Brian Kibler:**   
 Well my favorite card is [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary), but I'd probably want to be something a bit more powerful like [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Karn%2BLiberated). If you can be [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Karn%2BLiberated), always be [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Karn%2BLiberated).


**Comment From LLCoolDave:**  
 Which card would you most like to be good in post-rotation standard?


**Brian Kibler:**   
[Daybreak Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daybreak+Ranger)? I still have about a hundred. :)


**Comment From TheMasterTactician:**  
 What was it like to test with Jon Finkel?


**Brian Kibler:**   
 Jon and I actually go way back. We tested with each other as early as 1997. I was the only other person who played the Prison deck he made his first Top 8 with at Pro Tour Chicago. It was cool to reconnect and play together after so long. He's a cool guy to hang out with, and obviously super insightful when it comes to ****Magic****.


**Comment From Brian KiblerFan:**  
 How would you compare your preparation for this tournament with your preparation for a typical Pro Tour? More? Less? Same?


**Brian Kibler:**   
 Nice username! :) I probably tested less for this tournament specifically largely because of the timing. I was on the road at the World ****Magic**** Cup and Grand Prix Worcester the past few weeks, so it was hard to focus as much testing on this event. I ultimately felt really comfortable in all of the formats, though, so it was enough.


**Comment From cobo:**  
 What do you think of Alexander Hayne?


**Brian Kibler:**   
 I haven't really played with or against Alex, but from watching him play in Pro Tour **Avacyn Restored**, he definitely has the kind of analytical and deliberate play style that it takes to be a top player. He also played werewolf with us at Grand Prix Atlanta, and I don't think he ever voted to kill me, so I appreciate that.


**Comment From Mannequin:**  
 What reprint from the original *Ravnica* block would you like to see in *Return to Ravnica*?


**Brian Kibler:**   
 I didn't play a ton during *Ravnica*. That was during one of my breaks from ****Magic****, so I don't have the same attachments to cards from the block that a lot of people do. Maybe [Watchwolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watchwolf)? He was pretty sweet.


**Comment From Guest:**  
 What was was the hardest match you played in this tournament?


**Brian Kibler:**   
 Owen Turtenwald definitely gave me a serious run for my money in our match. I was incredibly far ahead on board in game 2 after winning game 1, and he made a sick play with [Primal Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Command) that completely wiped my board and reshuffled my [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) into my deck. I managed to win the match by peeling my sideboarded [Decree of Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Pain) on the last possible turn in game 3, so I feel pretty fortunate to have gotten out of that one with a win.


**Brian Kibler:**   
 One more question and then I've gotta run guys. :)


**Comment From Guest:**  
 If you had to choose, who would you have building your deck, Sam Black or Shouta Yasooka?


**Brian Kibler:**   
 Well I generally prefer to build my own decks, but if I had to hand over control I'd say Sam Black, if only because I actually understand the decks he builds, while Shouta shows up with [Doran, the Siege Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower)/Cryptic Command decks that confuse me as to how they're even supposed to ever work.


**Brian Kibler:**   
 And with that I'm out. Thanks for the questions, and thanks for rooting for me!
