Both of these players were going to Worlds but here they were playing for the extra pride that a spot on the National Team will give (along with extra pro points and an extra $1000 minimum. Like practically everyone else in the top eight, they are both playing red, Peset with Goblin Bidding and Reaubourg with big red. ### Game 1


Peset busted out some early creatures but they were taken out by [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) and [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt). Damien was screwed for mana, and had to just idly watch while Peset played a [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith), a Prospector and then a second [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith). The creatures got a few hits in while Damien did nothing. He finally reached three mana but all he could muster was a fairly irrelevant [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain) which resulted in a [Read the Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Runes) from Peset.


Peset attacked again and after Damien destroyed another land, Alex cast another [Read the Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Runes), discarded a Warchief and a Sharpshooter, untapped and sacrificed his [Skirk Prospector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Prospector)s for the mana to cast [Patriarch's Bidding](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Bidding), easily attacking for the win. For some reason Reaubourg destroyed Peset's [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) instead of a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), but it's not clear it would have mattered.

### Game 2


Damien again did nothing on the first two turns as Alex dropped a Sledder and a Prospector. Third turn saw a [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain) and then a Simulacrum on the fourth. This was Incinerated but Reabourg [Demolish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demolish)ed Alex's [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) and played [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm), reducing Peset to two [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s.


Peset fetches a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) with his [Bloodstained Mire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire) and drops a Piledriver. He was being attacked in the air by a [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) the whole time. Reabourg [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm)s it away but had absolutely no gas. Alexandre continued to draw lands as he dug through his deck with [Read the Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Runes), discarding Goblins along the way.


Soon Peset had enough mana to cast a Bidding, fetching back six Goblins which swing in and put Reabourg on 'dead next turn'. Reabourg Pulses Peset to five, untapped and did not draw the [Rorix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix) he needed (or a Pulse or [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet)) and scoops.
