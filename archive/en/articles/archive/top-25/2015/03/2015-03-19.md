It's another doubleheader week to talk about here at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. New Zealand and the United States played host to the last hurrah of the current Limited environment, as we all prepare to plunge into the world of *Dragons of Tarkir*. None of the Top 25 made it all the way to [Auckland](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpauc15) in New Zealand, and Japan's unheralded Teruya Kakumae took full advantage, claiming the title over Aussie Maitland Cameron.



[Cleveland](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpcle15) was a different story. The stars certainly came out to play, with no fewer than seventeen in action, and most of them for the full two days. Three headliners walked away with significant gains. The big mover was Andrew Cuneo. His 4th place in Cleveland leaps him six places to No. 15. Christian Calcano's reward for his fourth Grand Prix Top 8 is a return to the rankings at No. 25, while Yuuya Watanabe continued to be imperious, claiming yet another Top 8 berth, and a rise of two places to No. 10.



Josh Utter-Leyton lost out playing for Top 8, but his 12th place puts some distance between himself at No. 23 and Alexander Hayne at No. 24, who missed out on Day Two. Seth Manfield put in another eye-catching performance, steering his way to 13th, coincidentally his place in the rankings. In the Top 10 clutter, Ari Lax was able to parlay a Top 32 finish in Cleveland into a three-place rise, which sees him the new No. 5, while two Europeans—Jérémy Dezani and Stanislav Cifka—all fell at the lower end of the table.



The Top 4, however, remain unchanged, with Owen Turtenwald heading Lee Shi Tian, Eric Froehlich, and Ivan Floch. Enjoy your Prerelease, and we'll see you again next week at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
