The final round of Day One of a Grand Prix has a tendency to show some pretty insane bubble-matches, also known as players on the cusp of elimination from a tournament. In this case, it was two 18-point players of very notable fame who were going into Round 9 with their tournament lives at risk.



 Alejandro Betschart is a player well known to the Latin American **Magic** scene. After all, he has won the Uruguay National Championship not once, not twice, but three times, his last victory taking place in 2010 with [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle).




 Willy Edel, No. 10 Ranked Player and a player who is a very strong candidate for the **Magic** Hall of Fame in this year's voting, has been representing Brazil well for a very long time. His credentials also include a National Championship title, thanks to his win last year, but it also includes four Pro Tour Top 8 finishes and six Grand Prix Top 8 finishes, including a win at Grand Prix Toronto 2012.



Both long-time players knew what was at stake, and it's certainly not a situation that either were unfamiliar with, as they silently shuffled and prepared for the start of match. 



**The Decks**




 While the [Temple of Deceit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Deceit)s may throw you off, Betschart is piloting a fairly stock Mono-Black Devotion list, with all the usual key cards such as [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter), [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon), and of course, [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat).




 Edel, meanwhile, has turned in his Naya deck in favor of Boros Burn for this event. The match-up represents an awkward showdown between burn spells and a powerful life drain effect, and it can get worse for Edel if Betschart has a hand with [Devour Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+Flesh) to go with Gray Merchant, as the [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) effect can be turned on himself for some life gain in a pinch.




**The Games**




 Edel led off with [Boros Guildgate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Guildgate), his hand not blistering after a mulligan to six, while Betschart had a second-turn [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat). [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) was Edel's first play of the game, attacking Betschart down to 18. A second [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) made the clock 4 damage a turn, but Betschart's [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s and a second [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) made on the third turn threatened to end the game a lot faster than what Edel could handle.




 With a second [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) dropped onto the table on the fourth turn, Edel was forced to hold back his two Phoenixes in order to prevent an immediate end to the game, with Betschart representing a potential 18 damage if his creatures got in unblocked. Betschart animated a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and sent it in along with three rats.




 Edel's Phoenixes made his blocks: one in front of [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), the other in front of a rat. [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) gave the one blocking [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) double strike. That left Betschart with one damaged rat after the combat, which [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood) disposed of, recurring Edel's dead Phoenix.
