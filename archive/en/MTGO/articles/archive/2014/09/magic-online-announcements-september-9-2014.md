2014 *Magic Online* Community Cup Coverage
This weekend, we find out the answer to one of life's greatest mysteries: who will win in a contest between *Magic* fans and the people who make the game? The 2014 Community Cup is almost upon us! The competition will rage on all weekend, beginning on Friday, September 12 and coming to a close Sunday, September 14. Between our live stream on [Twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) and Twitter coverage via [@MagicOnline](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline) and [@wizards\_magic](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic), you'll have around-the-clock access to the latest event twists and turns. As if that weren't enough incentive stop by, you'll be able to get a first look at *Khans of Tarkir* in action during the Community Cup too!


All you viewers out there can even play *Magic* alongside your elected representatives with the [Community Events](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/2014-community-cup-companion-events-2014-08-26). Live stream coverage starts each day at 10:00 a.m. Pacific. See you this weekend!

Upcoming R&D Challenge Event on Friday, September 12
Think you have the *Magic* chops to beat the folks in R&D at their own game? Good, I like the cut of your jib. You're in. The time? High noon (Pacific). The place? The Scheduled events room. The format? Vintage Constructed. The prize? *Magic 2015* booster packs. Except for R&D. They don't get the booster packs. Check out the 2014 Community Cup: Companion Events [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/2014-community-cup-companion-events-2014-08-26#r&d) for all the details!
