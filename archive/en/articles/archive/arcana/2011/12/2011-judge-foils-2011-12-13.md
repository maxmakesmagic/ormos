If you've played in a sanctioned **Magic: The Gathering** tournament, you might have seen a judge around the place. And maybe you wondered why someone would become a judge. Well, there are lots of reasons. **Magic** judges get to help keep the tournaments fair and they get to share their extensive rules knowledge. And sometimes they get special judge-only foils!


The two most recent judge foils were released at Worlds in San Francisco, and they are [Xiahou Dun, the One-Eyed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xiahou+Dun%2C+the+One-Eyed) from *Portal Three Kingdoms* and [Flusterstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flusterstorm) from ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander*. They look like this!

Judges receive judge foils for attending Grand Prix and Pro Tour events and judge conferences. To learn more about how to be a judge, consult [wizards.com/judge](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=judge/welcome).
