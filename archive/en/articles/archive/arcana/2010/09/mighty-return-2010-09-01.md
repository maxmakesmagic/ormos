For sequel week, we're going to take another look at a ***Magic** 2010* card that makes a cameo in a different ***Magic** 2011* card. We start with the story of [Siege Mastodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Mastodon).

This armored elephant appears in both ***Magic** 2010* and ***Magic** 2011*, with different flavor text:

In its original printing, it appears to have been engaged in the defense of a city, but once it's in the hands of General Avitora (instead of some nameless Mastodon keeper) it's attacking someone defended by walls. Which might remind you of a different piece of flavor text.

So ... what card in ***Magic** 2011* shows a flying armored elephant?

(Okay, so the armored elephant on [Mighty Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap) doesn't have its tusks cut off. Close enough!)
