 **Q: What interesting, infinite combos are there in Standard today? While they might not be competitive I think that they are the most fun to construct and play with. â€”Shiftrex**  **A: Mike McArtor, copy editor for DailyMTG:** 

Here are a few to chew on:

 Shortly after *Theros* released, Gavin Verhey [presented one in ReConstructed](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/266). 

 Later, he wrote about [another one](https://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/274)! That same week, Mike Cannon presented two different takes [on that idea as well](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/274). It's apparently a popular combo. 

 Jacob Van Lunen got in on the fun as well, [once *Born of the Gods* released](https://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/pr/284). 

Enjoy!
