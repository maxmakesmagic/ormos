In addition, the winner of the World Championships Qualifier receives an invitation to the 2008 World Championships in Memphis, TN, USA, including two round-trip economy-class tickets from the airport nearest the winner's location to Memphis and five nights hotel accommodation during Worlds\*.

Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for the World Championships Qualifier event, players are not permitted to have more than 1 of their accounts entered in the event. Players are not permitted to have secondary accounts played by another person. If a player is discovered to have more than 1 account playing in the Championships before, during, or after the event, appropriate penalties will be applied (including disqualification from the event with no refund of product or event tickets).

Playing on another person's account, selling your account, etc. are all violations of the Terms of Service. If you play in these, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are on your own account. We do not recognize "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that adult has purchased.

A list of all players that have qualified for the World Championships Qualifier will be maintained on the Wizards of the Coast web site. Players will be registered into the Championships the morning of the next day after they qualified. It will be the player's responsibility to make sure that they have been properly entered into this event and are able to join it PRIOR to the start of the Championships. If a player is qualified and is unable to join the Championships, they will need to contact customer service to get this corrected.

If a player wins who has previously qualified for Worlds in Memphis, the airfare and accommodations will be awarded to that player while the invitation to 2008 World Championships will pass down to the player with the best finish who is not already invited to Worlds. The final Swiss standings will determine the difference between third and fourth place and the difference between fifth through eighth place, should that be necessary.

If a player wins that is ineligible to play in DCI™-sanctioned tournaments (i.e. DCI suspended and/or a paid contractor), then the Worlds invitation and the travel and accommodation prizes will pass down to the player with the best finish who is not already invited to Worlds. The final Swiss standings will determine the difference between third and fourth place and the difference between fifth through eighth place, should that be necessary.

In either of the above cases, the booster pack prizes will not pass down.

In order to remain eligible for Prizes, all qualified players **must** email [molworldsqt@wizards.com](mailto:molworldsqt@wizards.com) by Friday, October 17, 2008 at 10:00 AM PDT with the following information: Full Legal Name, Full Address, Telephone number, and DCI Number. **Players must put their MTGO Username as the subject of the email**. (Account passwords will not be requested--never give your password to anyone.) *Please do not email unless you have already qualified for the Championships.* Do not send an email for another player or account, and do not have another person send the email for you.

In addition, during the tournament, Wizards of the Coast staff (marked with the Wizards logo beside their online name) may ask players for their name and/or contact information. Do not give out your information to anyone who is not a Wizards of the Coast Staff (marked with the Wizards logo beside their online name).

Failure to provide accurate information may result in significant penalties, including suspension from online **Magic** tournaments up to and including termination of your Magic Online account.

**\*** The **Magic Online™ travel prize package** includes round-trip, coach airfare for the winner and a guest from the major airport nearest the winner's home to Memphis, TN, USA to attend the **Magic the Gathering** 2008 World Championships held on December 11 through December 14, 2008, and double occupancy accommodations at a hotel chosen by Wizards of the Coast, Inc. or its designate. Meals, gratuities, ground transportation and all other fees, costs, and expenses not specified herein are the winner's sole responsibility. All taxes are the sole responsibility of the winner. A representative of Wizards of the Coast, Inc. will contact the winner regarding this prize package. This prize is non-negotiable, non-transferable, and not redeemable for an alternate award except in Wizards' sole discretion. Trip must be taken on the dates designated by Wizards, or prize will be forfeited and will not be re-awarded. Specific travel dates and arrangements are subject to availability. Winner and guest must travel together on same itinerary. The winner and his/her guest will be required to sign and return prior to travel (i) a signed Consent and Release Agreement, (ii) the appropriate IRS tax form, (iii) proof of identification, and (iv) and other documentation designated by Wizards; failure to do so will result in disqualification. Minors (i.e., those under 18 years of age) who win the Magic Online World Championships Qualifier are not eligible to be awarded the plane ticket and hotel travel award. Instead, minors will be awarded a "Cash Equivalent Award" equal to the cost of a round trip ticket to the World Championships, as determined by Wizards in its sole discretion. This award will be issued only if the player actually shows up to the World Championships in Memphis on his or her own, and registers to play. Wizards will pay out this "Minor Qualifier Travel – Cash Equivalent Award" after the World Championships.
