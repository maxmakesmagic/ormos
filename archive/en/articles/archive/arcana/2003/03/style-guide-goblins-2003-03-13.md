Below is one of the sketches from the *Onslaught*  Style Guide, which is a document given to artists that worked on the set for reference. This sketch shows a "refugee" Goblin, meaning one that is not involved in the Pit-Fights.

*Legions* cards showing such Goblins include [Goblin Lookout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Lookout), [Goblin Clearcutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Clearcutter), and [Skirk Drill Sergeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Drill+Sergeant).
