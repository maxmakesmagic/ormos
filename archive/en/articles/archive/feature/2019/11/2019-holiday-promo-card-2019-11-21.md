Don't just settle for decking the halls this season. Deck out your draws with . . . cards from outside the game?


That's right! You don't need boughs of holly when you have the comforts of Decorated Knight at your disposal.


The Holiday Promo Card is something we've done for years around this time to celebrate the holidays and provide our partners, contractors, and employees with a fun treat to say thank you for being great. Chances are, if you receive one of these, we think you're pretty awesome.


This year, the more damage you give, the more value you get. Aren't the holidays great?
