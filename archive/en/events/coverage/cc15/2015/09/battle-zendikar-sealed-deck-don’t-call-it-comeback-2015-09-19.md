 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 





The Community Cup is an epic struggle of good versus evil, of the little guy fighting against the oppression of an invading army. And coming into the second half of the day, the invading army was winning. There was little that the bedraggled Wizards team could do to weather their onslaught.


It reminds me of another story: the story of a ragtag group of allies fighting against the monstrous hordes of rampaging Eldrazi. As such, it is fitting that the Community Cup be the venue for the world premiere of *Battle for Zendikar* Sealed Deck! Who better to empathize with the unfathomable monstrosities of the void than the heartless and cruel members of the Community team?

Things began with an incredibly cool moment. The packs used for this event were randomly taken from a random selection of boxes, yet the unthinkable happened.


"OH MAN," came the cry from across the room. Gabe "Doc" Reale had cracked the very first *Zendikar Expeditions* card, and it was absolutely glorious.

Everyone gathered around to see it in all its glory before settling back in to build their Sealed decks, for most in the room their first time putting hands on the actual physical cards of *Battle for Zendikar.* There were some other great moments from the build portion of the event. Melissa DeTora opened one of two copies of Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, in the room.

Alli Medwin opened not only her own sweet foil land...

But one of the two copies of Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, in the room!

The other ended up in the hands of man of the people, commander of men, Jimmy Wong.

And Magic: The Amateuring's Maria Bartholdi opened a pair of Emeria Shepherds!

As the matches began, a clear trend emerged. Just as the allies had to come together to turn the tide against the waves of murderous Eldrazi, so did the Wizards team begin to come together to overcome the deficit they faced.


Things weren't easy.

But after two rounds, the Wizards team had managed to crawl back from their 12-point deficit to even the score at 60-60!

In the final round of play, the big guns of the Wizards team stepped up to the plate and put the team on their shoulders, beginning with Senior Director of R&D Aaron Forsythe.

The Community team pushed back, the indomitable Kenji Egashira taking out the 5-0 Sam Stoddard.

Immediately after that, though, the Wizards team put three more wins up. In the end, things ended up 6-2 in favor of the Wizards team, giving them a 12-point lead to end Day 1 of play here at the 2015 Community Cup!


Community supporters fret not. Your team members have vowed that tomorrow is their day.
