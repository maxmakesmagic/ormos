Vintage Super League
It’s playoff time in the Vintage Super League! The Top 4 consists of one platinum pro (Eric Froehlich), one Hall of Famer (Luis Scott-Vargas), one vintage celebrity (David Williams), and one Vintage celebrity (Stephen Menendian). Tune in Tuesday to see long-time friends and current house-mates Eric and Dave battle in the first round of the playoffs while Steve and Luis play a tiebreaker match to see which of them gets the #1 seed and the bye into the finals. You can catch up on all the previous action at [VintageSuperLeague.com](http://vintagesuperleague.com/) and the playoffs will stream live on [twitch.tv/magic](www.twitch.tv/magic) this Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. Pacific (UTC -8).



 



The New *Magic Online* Legacy Cube
Randy Buehler is a longtime *Magic* player, a friend of the Vintage format, and a lover of the *Magic Online* Cube. Recently, he has been working with *Magic* R&D, leading the design for a complete Cube overhaul. With its release rapidly approaching, we asked him to write an [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/new-magic-online-legacy-cube-2014-11-3) to give you all an inside look at the design of the fantastic, new Legacy Cube.


Once you've read the article, check out the full Cube list [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-onlien-legacy-Cube-card-list), and the Legacy Cube event details below!

**Known Issues with Commander 2014**



* Offerings display blue text identifying a chosen opponent before it is chosen. The cards function correctly.
* [Song of the Dryad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Song+of+the+Dryad) enchanting another aura appears incorrectly. The card functions correctly.
* Artifact creature tokens created by *Commander 2014* cards show no art when zoomed in or in the preview pane.

**Fixes and Updates**


**Game Play**



* Fixed: [Glittering Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glittering+Wish) now allows you to wish for split cards where each half is a different single color.
* Fixed: Creatures with enters-the-battlefield triggers that enter the battlefield at the same time will now all trigger off of each other.
* Fixed: You can only discard your commander once to the same discard effect.
* Fixed: [Turn to Frog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog) affecting [Nighthowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nighthowler) or a similar creature no longer causes it to die as the turn ends
* Fixed: The “Cancel” button in “Choose X” prompts now cancels the spell or ability instead of functioning like the “OK” button.
* Fixed: [Virtue's Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Virtue%27s+Ruin) is now legal in the proper formats.
* Fixed: The rules text of Entwine cards now appears correctly on the stack.
* Updated: The actions around a player exiling cards with the delve mechanic including the prompt, highlighting, and the log have been updated. Additionally, exiled cards for delve now all go to exile simultaneously both visually and mechanically. This impacts cards such as [Rakshasa Vizier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Vizier) whose triggered ability will now only trigger once when exiling cards with delve.


**Client**



* Fixed: The context menu for a trade binder now works without the user having to open a deck first.
* Fixed: Dual lands from Masters Edition now have the alternating rectangle rules text boxes.
* Updated: We have retitled the "Place triggered abilities on the stack" and "[PLAYERNAME]'s triggers" windows to "PLAYERNAME's triggered abilities."
* Updated: *Khans of Tarkir* 5-card booster has an updated image.
