Greetings and welcome to the beginning of another preconstructed evolution!


Before we get there, though, a couple of notes about [last week](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/interlude-hidden-gems-betrayers-2005-04-11). People seemed to enjoy the “junk rare” look of my first Interlude. Actually, you all *flooded* me with e-mail piling on further suggestions. Most ideas fell into two buckets:


* If you look beyond a Standard cardpool, [Chisei, Heart of Oceans](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chisei%2C+Heart+of+Oceans) can be a lot more of a benefit than hindrance. Any card with cumulative upkeep or Age counters turn Chisei into not only a fattie flier but a huge boon. The favorite combos people submitted were [Decree of Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Silence), [Unstable Mutation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable+Mutation), [Illusions of Grandeur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusions+of+Grandeur), and [Illusionary Forces](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Forces). [Quicksilver Fountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Fountain) was a favorite Standard-legal combo with Chisei, too.
* The universal second color people wanted to add to my Twist Allegiance deck was green. Try green's mana-acceleration, they suggested. Try [Fecundity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fecundity), they urged. Try [Natural Affinity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Affinity) for a 10-mana win. Cool ideas, all, and probably can be combined into a single new decklist. In red, other suggestions included [Genju of the Spires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genju+of+the+Spires) and [Shimatsu the Bloodcloaked](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimatsu+the+Bloodcloaked) (11-mana combo).

Nicely done, everyone!


Okay, now let's get back to preconstructed decks. Here is the poll from [two weeks ago](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/ninjutsu-free-be-you-and-me-2005-04-04):




| **Which deck is Jay going to play and change next?**  |
| --- |
| Dark Devotion | 3311 | 38.8% |
| Rat's Nest | 2745 | 32.2% |
| Spiritcraft | 2479 | 29.0% |
| **Total** | **8535** | **100.0%** |

The goal for the next three weeks will be to take the [Dark Devotion preconstructed deck](http://www.wizards.com/magic/displaythemedeck.asp?set=bok&decknum=1&lang=en) and evolve it into a fun, respectable Standard deck. On one hand, I'm excited because Demons and Ogres are full of flavor and have the potential to make a very cool deck. On the other hand, I'm a little apprehensive because I wonder whether a budget Demon deck is even possible. As a result, I expect a wild, twisting ride. Woo!


First, though, remember the Guidelines (also remember that these are “guidelines” rather than “rules” because I expect occasionally to stray from them):


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/magic_expansion_bok_td1LargePic_en.jpg)1. Start with a preconstructed deck, unedited, and play it.
2. Don't make changes until playing the deck in at least five games.
3. Change no more than five cards at a time.
4. Build a respectable deck that's fun to play.
5. Build an affordable deck.

Remember, too, that the point of these deckbuilding series is to enjoy the journey. You will often disagree with my personal card evaluations or choices. That's okay -- healthy, in fact -- and I hope you take your differing opinion and turn it into a killer deck.


### Dark Devotion First Takes


Here is what you get if you buy the Dark Devotion preconstructed deck. As always, I've done some sorting of the cards, separating land from creatures from non-land/non-creatures and sorting roughly on number of copies and cost. To me, this is the easiest way to eyeball the deck and see what's going on.

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swamp)


















Before I play any games, it's worth reflecting on my first-impressions of the deck and its cards. Like all preconstructed decks, you can expect me to be a little critical of what I see. This isn't an indictment of the deck or its potential, but it helps illustrate why precons generally struggle against more polished constructed decks. It also helps me organize my thoughts about where to look for initial changes to the deck.


*1) Deck Themes*: I first try to figure out the major and minor themes in the deck. Each of these themes are pulling the deck in a direction, and each is a possible path to follow when making changes. It's always good to be conscious of your deck themes so that any changes you make are consistent. Understanding deck themes is also a good explanation for why two deckbuilders can start with the same precon and end up with two very different final decks.


In any case, here are the themes in Dark Devotion as I see them:


* Major theme: Demons and Ogres. Most of what Dark Devotion is trying to do is use those conditional clauses on a lot of Demons ([Scourge of Numai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+of+Numai)) and Ogres ([Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre)) to make superior creatures that kick butt. The more the deck can exploit Demon-Ogre interactions, theoretically the more it is dominating a game. [Mark of the Oni](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Oni) and [Oni Possession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oni+Possession) are also around to enhance this theme.
* Major theme: Beef. Dark Devotion isn't trying to win with a horde of one- and two-power creatures. It's trying to overwhelm an opponent with solid creatures of three or more mana. As a result, power-to-cost ratio is something the deck is trying to maximize to the exclusion of everything else. Notice that with very few exceptions, the deck's creatures have power equal to their converted mana cost. Also notice that except for [Bile Urchin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Urchin) and [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami), all of the creatures cost more than two mana.
* Minor theme: Creature elimination. Forget all of that Ninja-bouncing nonsense, Dark Devotion wants to flat-out destroy opposing creatures. [Bloodthirsty Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre), [Initiate of Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Initiate+of+Blood), [Call for Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+for+Blood), [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague), and [Torrent of Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Stone) are there to blast away blockers and let your Demons run free.
* Minor theme: Sacrificial lambs. I'm not sure what to make of this theme, but there are a lot of cards ([Yukora the Prisoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yukora+the+Prisoner), [Painwracker Oni](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painwracker+Oni), [Oni Possession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oni+Possession), [Call for Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+for+Blood)) that have you sacrificing your hard-earned creatures. Maybe this is just a side effect of Ogre blood-magic, but it's shame there aren't any cards focusing on graveyard animation (other than a lone [Blood Speaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Speaker)), token generation, etc. to take advantage of these cards or make them easier to handle.
* A few other minor themes exist, like stealing life, stealing creatures, and enchanting creatures. By far the most entertaining of these minor themes is the interaction of [Heartless Hidetsugu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartless+Hidetsugu) and [Overblaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overblaze).

The good news is that there are very few directions pulling on the deck. That is, the vast majority of the cards are aligned with one or more of the dominant themes I've outlined above. The two major themes are also highly compatible, since if you want to focus on Demon-Ogre interactions you're probably also trying to overwhelm an opponent with fatties.


*2) Mana*: I have two concerns with the deck's mana and both are significant ones. First, the deck is trying to both be aggressive and balance two colors. This is a tricky equation and something I'll need to spend a lot of time thinking about. Say goodbye to the elegant lack of mana issues from a monocolored deck and hello to manascrew, colorscrew, and the need to drop double-cost cards (for example, [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague)) for single-cost alternatives (for example, [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)).


My second concern is about the deck's manacurve in general. Dark Devotion looks like it's doing next to nothing in the early turns and hoping its midgame will overpower whatever an opponent has planned. The fact that almost a third of the deck costs more than three mana strikes me as a Very Bad Thing, especially when the deck has no mana-acceleration whatsoever.


*3) Consistency*: There isn't a single four-of card in the deck, and only three cards ([Takenuma Bleeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takenuma+Bleeder), [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami), and [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre)) with three copies. Instead, the deck is stuffed full of one- and two-of cards without the benefit of any card-drawing or library manipulation at all. [Blood Speaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Speaker) is the deck's one tutor, yet again there's only one of them in the deck. As a result, I expect Dark Devotion to be highly inconsistent with its draws and performance. This is, unfortunately, one of the hallmarks of a preconstructed deck.


 



![Ogre Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ogre+Recluse)

*4) Power*: Probably the best thing about Dark Devotion is its overall power level. In fact, the whole idea of the deck is to make creatures that are more than your opponent can handle. From common to uncommon to rare, the deck is using very respectable cards. Better options exist in Standard for a lot of what the deck is trying to do -- and some omissions like [Ogre Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Recluse) are bizarre -- but given that it's cobbled together from *Champions* and *Betrayers* only, you have to like what's in there. In fact, this is probably one of the only precons that is likely to not only retain its two rares ([Yukora the Prisoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yukora+the+Prisoner) and [Heartless Hidetsugu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartless+Hidetsugu)) but want more copies of each.

*5) Fun*: What's not fun about bashing face with Demons and Ogres? Besides, there is something satisfying about building a deck around creatures with natural synergy like [Scourge of Numai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+of+Numai) and [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre), much like eating a sandwich the just the right bread and spread (hrm...or maybe I'm just hungry). The point is that if you can actually build a successful deck around beefy Demons and their Ogre supplicants, you're probably having fun and getting an opportunity to practice your maniacal laugh to boot.


Those are first impressions. Let's see how the deck does in practice, shall we? For those new to this column, I play all of my games in the Casual Constructed room of Magic Online with the account name “BuildingOnABudget”. I'm on pretty much every day at random times, so feel free to stop by and either watch or play a game.


### Playing With Devotion


I've been ambivalent about the “game log” sections of these articles. Some people have written to say they are boring and detract from the content. Other have written that they're the best part of each article. I'm keeping them because I think it's important to understand what cards are winning me games, losing me games, and what sort of decks I'm facing. I try to put just enough detail into the logs to get this information across without bogging you down with a play-by-play. Expect there to be more detail early on in the series and less as the deck becomes more predictable in its performance.


*Game 1: Red-white Equip*


 



![Yukora the Prisoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Yukora+the+Prisoner)

I started out with a pair of [Bile Urchin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Urchin)s while he started out with a pair of [Goblin Striker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Striker)s and a [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter). Things looked bad when he added [Leonin Den-Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Den-Guard) to the mix, but I drew and played [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami). My Kami killed his axe, then [Yukora the Prisoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yukora+the+Prisoner) entered the fray. My opponent failed to draw more equipment, so one by one his creatures became Yukora speed bumps. [Frost Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Ogre) joined in the fun, eating two [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) chump-blockers and generally causing mayhem. Finally, an [Oni Possession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oni+Possession) on Yukora overpowered his last [Samurai of the Pale Curtain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+of+the+Pale+Curtain) blocker to deal lethal damage.

*Game 2: Monoblack Rats*


At first, I was sure his [Nezumi Cutthroat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Cutthroat) would be rendered useless by my Bile Urchin. Then he played [Grafted Wargear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafted+Wargear). That was okay, though, because I had [Takenuma Bleeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takenuma+Bleeder). Then he played another Wargear. Okay...I tried [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre) and [Scourge of Numai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+of+Numai). We both momentarily forgot that neither his Rat nor my Ogre could block, then we started wailing on each other and racing for the win. He played [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), then [Grave Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Pact), and all of my creatures died to mass-blocking. Two [Torrent of Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Stone)s killed two more of his Rats, but eventually another 8/5 Jitte-slinging Cutthroat showed up to finish me off.


*Game 3: Monoblue Ninjas*


You got it, I faced off against a Ninja deck inspired by my last series. And you know what? He *destroyed* me. I had a [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre) and [Takenuma Bleeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takenuma+Bleeder), but his [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem), Higure, [Sage Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Owl), [Mistblade Shinobi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistblade+Shinobi) business smacked me around turn after turn. I had Hidetsugu and [Overblaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overblaze) in hand, but could never find a second Mountain to go with my five Swamps. I also had [Kumano's Blessing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%27s+Blessing) in hand, which was less than useless.


*Game 4: Black-blue Blinkmoth Urn deck*


 



![Gemstone Array](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gemstone+Array)

His deck was trying to do something scary, putting artifacts like Talismans, [Gemstone Array](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Array), [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), and [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) into play along with [Blinkmoth Urn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Urn). I cast an early [Bile Urchin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Urchin), then followed it up with [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre) and [Deathcurse Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathcurse+Ogre). Both of my Ogres met [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague) deaths, but I started drawing a lot of creatures at the same time my opponent started drawing a lot of land. My Urchin was joined by another [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre), [Initiate of Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Initiate+of+Blood), and [Scourge of Numai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+of+Numai) to end the game while my opponent had something like 40 counters on [Gemstone Array](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Array). Whew.

*Game 5: Green-blue Azusa (?) deck*


For the first time in five games, I actually won the die roll. I think my opponent was playing an Azusa, Lost But Seeking deck, or maybe it had [Rude Awakening](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rude+Awakening), or maybe both. He used [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), and [Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble) to get lots of land into play with [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) looking for...something. Anyway, I didn't do anything for the first three turns, but then dropped Scourge of Numai, [Frost Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Ogre), and [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre). That was game.


Starting 3-2 isn't the worst for a pure preconstructed deck, but all I learned from two of the wins was that I can beat a defenseless opponent. The good news is that I'm starting to get a feel for the deck, so it's time to make some changes . . .


### Those (Mana) Hungry Ogres


There is a lot I want to do with this deck right out of the chutes, much more so than with Ninjutsu. Let me start by addressing the obvious drops...


*OUT*: 1 [Kumano's Blessing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%27s+Blessing)


 



![Kumano's Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kumano%27s+Blessing)

I'm starting to suspect that each preconstructed deck contains one truly horrible card just to see if you're paying attention. In Ninjutsu, that card was [Field of Reality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+of+Reality). In Dark Devotion, it's [Kumano's Blessing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%27s+Blessing). I honestly have no idea what I'm supposed to do with the Blessing nor how I am supposed to play it in the deck. I suppose technically it could disrupt an opponent with Spirits or some other sort of graveyard recursion, but this is far too narrow a mechanic to have maindeck. Besides, this deck wants to pound people senseless, not worry about tricks like removing cards from graveyards. Consider [Nezumi Graverobber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Graverobber) as a card that would perform a similar function with a lot more synergy in the deck. Heck, [Yamabushi's Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yamabushi%27s+Flame) is the same cost and a lot more useful. Whatever you do, keep [Kumano's Blessing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%27s+Blessing) away from me.

*OUT*: 1 [Deathcurse Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathcurse+Ogre)


A lot of really cool, beefy Ogres exist in Standard these days, but [Deathcurse Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathcurse+Ogre) isn't one of them. Six mana is way, way, way too much to spend for a 3/3 body attached to a marginal ability that could hurt you as much as your opponent. For one less mana, you can have [Heartless Hidetsugu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartless+Hidetsugu). For two less mana, you can have [Ogre Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Recluse). For half the mana, you can have [Takenuma Bleeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takenuma+Bleeder). If you had some sort of graveyard recursion in your deck, [Deathcurse Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathcurse+Ogre) becomes slightly more attractive, but only slightly since [Kokusho, the Evening Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star) is a much better ability for the same cost. All in all, we can do better here.


*OUT*: 1 [Sokenzan Bruiser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sokenzan+Bruiser)


I refer you to my discussion of [Deathcurse Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathcurse+Ogre) to understand why I'm dropping [Sokenzan Bruiser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sokenzan+Bruiser). He's one less mana than Deathcurse and his mountainwalk ability will sometimes win games, but there are a lot better options for Ogres and a heck of a lot better options for a five-mana spell.


*OUT*: 2 [Bile Urchin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Urchin)


[Bile Urchin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Urchin) isn't the worst card in the deck by a long shot but it seems completely out of place. On one hand, [Bile Urchin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Urchin) is one of the only plays Dark Devotion has in the first two turns. On the other hand, I think there are about a hundred other things I'd rather do on the first turn than play a 1/1 Spirit. Out he goes, mostly to make room for some mana acceleration.


*IN*: 1 [Takenuma Bleeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takenuma+Bleeder)


 



![Takenuma Bleeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Takenuma+Bleeder)

I think, though I'm not yet sure, that [Takenuma Bleeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takenuma+Bleeder) is the best three-mana Ogre available in Standard right now. It certainly has the right power and toughness for three mana, and its drawback isn't debilitating even without the presence of a Demon. The one black mana makes it very easy to cast in a two-color deck as well. I'm pretty sure that of the existing cards in the deck, this is a four-copy gem.

*IN*: 4 [Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble)


Dropping [Deathcurse Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathcurse+Ogre) and [Sokenzan Bruiser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sokenzan+Bruiser) starts to bring the deck's manacurve into reasonable territory, but this is a deck still desperately in need of mana acceleration. There are three straightforward ways to get this acceleration in a black-red deck: 1) [Talisman of Indulgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Indulgence), 2) [Iron Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr) and/or [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr), and 3) [Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble). All three options are going to let you play a four-mana creature on Turn 3. Let me try and explain why I want to try [Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble) first...


[Talisman of Indulgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Indulgence) is good because it gives access to both black and red mana and can be used right away. The downsides are: a) it hurts you to use colored mana, b) it gives opposing decks something to kill with artifact destruction, and c) it doesn't do anything on its own. This last one is particularly annoying, since the last thing you want to do in the mid- or late-game is draw a [Talisman of Indulgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Indulgence). The real reason to not use it, though, is that you will almost never be able to use it the turn you cast it because all of your cards are so expensive, thus negating one of its big benefits.


Not being able to use the Talisman right away makes Iron and [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) more attractive. After all, they can actually attack and block while providing the same mana boost as the Talisman. The downside is that they're fragile and only give access to one color mana. Still, these are cards that hurt a lot less to draw later in the game.


[Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble) is difficult to compare to the Myr because it's neither a creature nor a mana-producer on its own. On the other hand, it thins land from your library and can search for black or red mana as needed. If you know anything about my deckbuilding proclivities, you know that I love land-thinning. Since the deck is doing very little else in the early turns, I would rather have land taken from my library than balance my hopes on a fragile 1/1 artifact creature. Thus I think the Bauble is more reliable mana acceleration and sets up your deck better in the late-game. We'll see, I suppose.

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swamp)


















So how go the changes? Did I speed up my deck at all? Let's see...


*Game 6: White-green Super Samurai*


Well, my opponent certainly sped up *his* deck. He had [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s and [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) to go along with [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top). I had an early [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami) and [Bloodthirsty Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre), which was forced to accumulate devotion counters because of his Elders. Eventually my opponent played [Takeno, Samurai General](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takeno%2C+Samurai+General). I responded with [Torrent of Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Stone) and started swinging for the fences with my two creatures plus Scourge of Numai. My Ogre killed his [Konda's Hatamoto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%27s+Hatamoto) thanks to Oni devotion and I kept swinging. Eventually my opponent played [Konda, Lord of Eiganjo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%2C+Lord+of+Eiganjo) and believed he stabilized. What he didn't realize was that my Ogre could kill his master Samurai (indestructibility doesn't help if you're 0/0). Besides, I could have just rushed him for two turns to win.


Honestly, for some reason I thought you lost the devotion counters when you used [Bloodthirsty Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre)'s -X/-X ability. The fact that the counters stay make it a much more interesting card. Hmm.


*Game 7: White-red-green Samurai*


 



![Painwracker Oni](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Painwracker+Oni)

The red was for burn and a few Samurai, but mostly it was a “super samurai” deck like the one above. I killed [Nagao, Bound By Honor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nagao%2C+Bound+By+Honor) with [Torrent of Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Stone), allowing my [Takenuma Bleeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takenuma+Bleeder) and [Scourge of Numai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+of+Numai) to attack with abandon. His [Battle-Mad Ronin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle-Mad+Ronin) plinked away at me for one damage a turn. Eventually he dropped [Konda, Lord of Eiganjo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%2C+Lord+of+Eiganjo) which stalled my attack. His double (spliced) [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) killed my Bleeder, meaning I was taking damage from the Scourge. I drew [Painwracker Oni](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painwracker+Oni) with just enough time to eat the Scourge and attack for the win. Whew. [Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble) made an appearance early, helping me fix my mana.

*Game 8: Green-red Aggro*


I felt like a boy among men in this game. I got a decent start with [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami) and [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre), but it all came screeching to a halt when he killed my Kami with [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet), then put [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter) on a [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin). One by one my Ogres died, stranding my [Painwracker Oni](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painwracker+Oni) in hand. He cast [Kumano, Master Yamabushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%2C+Master+Yamabushi) then [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) to retrieve the [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet), meaning that even a [Torrent of Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Stone) on his Goblin wouldn't have helped. Just to end the game a turn faster, I cast [Overblaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overblaze) on an attacking Kumano.


I made an important discovery in this game: I hate self-sacrifice cards if I don't have a way to exploit them. [Oni Possession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oni+Possession), [Call for Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+for+Blood), [Painwracker Oni](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painwracker+Oni)...these cards seem unnecessarily harsh and stressful. In a constructed format, I should often be willing to pay the creature-cost if I'm playing those cards, and currently it rarely feels like a fair trade.


*Game 9: Blue-red-white Arcane deck*


My opponent played [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) with [Dampen Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dampen+Thought) beneath it, which I killed with [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami). Then he played another Scepter with another [Dampen Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dampen+Thought), which I killed with another [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami). He gave up on milling me out of cards and instead focused on splicing first one, then two, [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray)s at my head. Luckily I had [Yukora the Prisoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yukora+the+Prisoner) flexing his muscles. Unluckily, he kept bouncing Yukora with [Consuming Vortex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consuming+Vortex) and [Boomerang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boomerang). Yukora hit once. Then eventually twice. I finally played [Frost Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Ogre) to go along with my Demon. During my attack my opponent tapped out to kill the Ogre with double-spliced Ray on [Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists), so I played [Overblaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overblaze) on Yukora for the win. I ended the game at 10 life.


*Game 10: Red-green Land Destruction*


It's rare to see a dedicated LD deck in the Casual room of ***Magic** Online*, and you would think it would be death to my deck. My [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami) was [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)ed, and I used [Torrent of Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Stone) on his [Vine Trellis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vine+Trellis). My [Takenuma Bleeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takenuma+Bleeder) and [Bloodthirsty Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre) started beating down while my opponent played one, then two, then three [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain)s on my only Swamps. When I found another Swamp he used [Creeping Mold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold) on it. I was sort of annoyed since had he not played even one of those cards I could have dropped [Heartless Hidetsugu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartless+Hidetsugu) (or, with two Swamps, [Painwracker Oni](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painwracker+Oni)). I was eating his life in chunks, though, and while a [Rootrunner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootrunner) blocked my Bleeder and a [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) killed my Ogre, I found the mana for Hidetsugu and one swing from him ended the game.


Time for a few more changes for cards I never seem to be happy to draw...


### Thirsty?


*OUT*: 2 [Oni Possession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oni+Possession)


 



![Oni Possession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Oni+Possession)

[Oni Possession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oni+Possession) is, surprisingly, my least favorite card still in the deck. Don't get me wrong: I like the +3/+3, I *love* the trample, and I can even see the use of turning things into Demons (though I once got myself into trouble by making an Ogre a Demon Spirit and thus losing a creature to Painwracker Oni). What I dislike is the “At the beginning of your upkeep, sacrifice a creature” bit. This deck never has a surplus of creatures -- often only one or two on the table at a time -- and so I have never found it acceptable to use [Oni Possession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oni+Possession) as more than a finisher, a sort of [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) for the last, lethal points of damage. [Oni Possession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oni+Possession) is too slow and too expensive to be used as a [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth), and so I can find better things for this card slot.

Note, though, that another way to go would be to keep the Possession and add something like [Genesis Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Chamber) to the deck. If you really like [Oni Possession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oni+Possession) and think it's cool, you can certainly bend your deck to make sacrificing creatures less of a burden and to add non-Ogre creatures that can become Demons. The Myr look like better acceleration than [Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble) in a deck like this, too.


*IN*: 2 [Scourge of Numai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+of+Numai)


With [Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble), the deck hopes to ramp up to four mana by turn three. The best four-mana card in the deck is [Yukora the Prisoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yukora+the+Prisoner), so you should expect I'll be taking a hard look at balancing the fact that he's an expensive rare with the deck's need for Demon beef. In the meantime, the second-best four-mana card is [Scourge of Numai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+of+Numai). The life-loss can be a pain (heh), but a 4/4 body for four mana can do a lot of damage, especially on the third turn.


*OUT*: 3 [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre)


I love that [Villainous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Ogre) is a third-turn, three-power Ogre. I can't abide a creature that doesn't block, though. This deck isn't so aggressive that it doesn't care about blocking, and the regeneration ability seems almost out of place on a creature that can only attack. If he was able to block with a Demon on the table, I would probably keep him. The fact that he can *never* block, though, has me wanting to use these slots for a different three-mana Ogre...


*IN*: 3 [Bloodthirsty Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre)


I'm intrigued by [Bloodthirsty Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre). I think in a monoblack deck (which is still a possibility for this experiment) I would rather have [Ogre Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Marauder), but the one time I actually had a chance to see [Bloodthirsty Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre) hoard devotion counters I was very impressed. I worry about his toughness, obviously, but I'm willing to see if he's as good as the one game I actually played him.


Which leaves me here for today:

I still think there is a lot to do with this deck, and unlike Ninjutsu I think I may eventually undo some of the changes I've already made. Still, we're on our way.


Next week I'll start out with some game logs and then take a look at the creature removal in the deck. Right now (excluding [Bloodthirsty Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre)), I'm relying on [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague), [Call for Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+for+Blood), and [Torrent of Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Stone) as creature removal. These are undoubtedly inferior to what Standard has to offer, but there are a *lot* of options in Standard. Speak up on the Message Boards about what you would do with these slots (and why) and I'll make my own decision next week.


Oh, and as always... Have fun!
