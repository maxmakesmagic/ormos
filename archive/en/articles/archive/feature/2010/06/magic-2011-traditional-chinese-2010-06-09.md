M**agic** is truly a global phenomenon, and with the ***Magic** 2011* Core Set our favorite game will be printed in ten different languages!


Over its 17-year existence, **Magic** has been printed in English, Italian, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Russian, and Korean (from 1996-1998). Traditional Chinese took a hiatus in 2003, but we are pleased to announce: Beginning in July, **Magic** will once again be printed in Traditional Chinese for release in Hong Kong and Taiwan! After the addition of Russian in 2005, the return of Traditional Chinese will bring the language count up to ten for the ***Magic** 2011* Core Set, a tie for the most languages a **Magic** set has been printed in.
