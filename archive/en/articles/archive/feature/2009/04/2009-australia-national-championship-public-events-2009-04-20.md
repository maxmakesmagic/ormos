### July 17th, 18th and 19th Rydges Lakeside, London Circuit, Canberra



This flyer lists the public-entry events that will be on offer as Ancillary Events at the 2009 Australian National Championships for *Magic: the Gathering*. The event program features a wide and varied selection of activities, including formal Qualifiers (for both the National Championships themselves, and a Standard Constructed Qualifier for Pro Tour Austin), organised tournaments, and on-demand events. There are many different formats to choose from, all with generous prizes, making for a fun-filled long weekend of gaming! The venue will be open from 8:45am until 11:00pm each day. Further details can be obtained from the David Low, the Ancillary Events Organiser, via E-Mail to dlow@actewagl.net.au or telephone 0413-556-683. See document updates and extra information at <http://dlow.actewagl.net.au/ausnats09-side.htm>.


### Programmed Events


These are tournaments that are programmed into the weekend, with fixed formats and starting times. Since many events have a limited number of places, you are advised to register early. **Registration closes five minutes before the advertised starting time.** The Tournament Organiser may cancel any Programmed Event that does not have at least 8 participants (or 3 teams) by the close of Registration. All rounds are of 50 minutes duration (plus up to five extra turns to bring the match to a conclusion). Draft events allow 30 minutes to draft before 15 minutes of deck construction; Sealed Deck events allow 30 minutes of deck construction. Events are sanctioned where possible.


***Special Deal***: Players may purchase an "All Day Ticket" for $100, valid for Friday 17th July, which provides entry to all Nationals Open Qualifiers (including Nationals Open Qualifier Sealed #1 if preregistered and prepaid by 5pm Monday 13th July; details on how to preregister are available at the website mentioned in the first paragraph). If you qualify for Nationals while playing on this ticket, you get free entry to a draft event (Nationals Practice or "on-demand") sometime over the long weekend; if you ***don't*** qualify for Nationals after playing all day Friday on this ticket, you get a bonus booster prize in every Programmed Event you enter for the rest of the long weekend!


There are also $100 tickets available on Friday and Saturday, which give entry to each of the three Magic-2010 Launch Parties that day. These tickets must be purchased before the first event each day begins (i.e. before 10 am Friday, or before 9:30 am Saturday).


### Prizes


The National Open Qualifiers award a mixed booster display (36 packs) to all players who make it to the final single-elimination round, plus Nationals qualification to the winner(s) of that final round. QT Austin offers prizes based on finishing position at the end of the Swiss rounds, with the top-8 then playing off for the PT invitation. Other events award participation prizes of one booster per round you play, handed out when you leave the event. In addition, Programmed (not On-Demand) Events award a mixed booster display to the winner (split amongst any/all players tied for first place on total match points).


Junior players (age 16 and under) get a bonus booster prize for every Programmed Event they enter. Proof of age must be presented upon request.


### On-Demand Events


These require a group of eight players: the tournament staff will be happy to assist you with circulating an expressions-of-interest list. Both constructed and limited (sealed or draft) events are available, and are sanctioned where possible. These events run for three Swiss rounds. On-demand events are available from 10 am each morning, and have a "last-start" curfew of 7 pm each night.


*Constructed events*: format can be anything you can get at least eight people to agree upon! Some ideas are listed at the end of this document, and more are available at [http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/doccenter/home](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/doccenter/home). Entry fee is $15 per player.


*Limited (draft) events*: an entry fee of $20 (Odyssey and later packs) or $30 (pre-Odyssey packs) per player gets each player a set of three boosters to draft. Drafts are usually conducted with one booster from each set in a "block"; but any mix of available stock is possible, with the agreement of the players.


*Limited (sealed deck) events*: an entry fee of $40 (Onslaught and later packs) or $60 (pre-Onslaught packs) per player gets each player either six boosters, or a tournament pack plus two boosters.


### Deck Construction Rules


Details on tournament formats, banned lists, and floor rules can be found at:  
[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/doccenter/home](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/doccenter/home). You should be familiar with the Universal Tournament Rules, the Magic: The Gathering Floor Rules, the DCI Magic Tournament Policy, and the Penalty Guidelines, all of which are linked from that page. 


*CONSTRUCTED FORMATS:* minimum deck size 60 cards, optional 15-card sideboard, no more than four copies of any one card between deck and sideboard in total (except basic land, which has no restrictions). Swaps from the sideboard may be made between games on a one-for-one basis (the sideboard must always contain exactly 15 cards).


*LIMITED FORMATS:* minimum deck size 40 cards, unused cards are your sideboard. Any number of changes to your deck using sideboard cards may be made between games, but you must keep a minimum 40-card deck size. Required basic land is provided upon request.
