Theros has a pantheon of fifteen gods, five of which appear in *Born of the Gods*. Four of the gods are presented here. The fifth, [Xenagos, God of Revels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+God+of+Revels), is talked about in the "[Planeswalker's Guide to *Born of the Gods*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/281)".


Â 

**Ephara, God of the Polis:** Ephara is the god of city-states and building. Ephara represents and presides over any organized state of people, but in particular she is worshipped in Meletis. Ephara is also the god of industry, civic wisdom, scholarship, religious sculpture, friezes, architecture, societal progress, social philosophy, and the protection and stability of the city. It is believed that her presence keeps a polis safe from beings of the wild; when a marble building or stone wall is erected, some representation of Ephara's face is almost always included.
