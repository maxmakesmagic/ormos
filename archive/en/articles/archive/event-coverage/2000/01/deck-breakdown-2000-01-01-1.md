| Replenish | 13 |
| White Weenie | 12 |
| Accelerated Blue | 10 |
| Control Black | 9 |

| Mercenaries | 1 |
| Mono-red burn | 1 |
| Lackey Sligh | 1 |
| Red/blue control | 1 |

|  | =117 decks total |

This is a very diverse field - no deck makes up even 15% of the field while 9 different decks can claim to be over 5%. If anything is dominant, Forests are with Stompy and Angry Hermit finishing first and second in popularity.


Classification notes: All the white weenie decks were Rebel decks. Two Angry Hermit decks didn't actually have any Hermits (or Poachers). There are 17 total Skyshroud Poacher decks, which would make it #1 if I lumped them together.
