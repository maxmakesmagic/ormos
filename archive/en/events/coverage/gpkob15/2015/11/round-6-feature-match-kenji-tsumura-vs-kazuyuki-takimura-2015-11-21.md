With so many good Japanese *Magic* players in the field at GP Kobe, it's no surprise that two would meet sooner rather than later. The sixth round brought a match between Pro Tour Hall of Famer, Kenji Tsumura, and Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar* Champion, Kazuyuki Takimura.


Kenji Tsumura brought the same deck this weekend that he brought last weekend: Abzan. Although the Hall of Famer was eliminated from GP Brussels with a subpar 5-3 record, he decided to continue attacking his opponents with [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s, [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector)s, [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds), and [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree)s again this weekend. The biggest change that he made was the addition of [Nissa, Vastwood Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Vastwood+Seer), to his sideboard. The deck has treated him well thus far, sitting with only a single loss as a blemish on his record.


It's a little surprising, then, that Kazayuki Takimura decided to change decks from his victory at Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*. This weekend he switched from Abzan to [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors). Takimura was afraid that he was going to face a bunch of Abzan mirror matches—a matchup he wasn't looking forward to playing—and thought that the Rally had all the tools he needed to win this weekend.

The Games
=========


Tsumura started the match off with a perfect Abzan curve for the first game: [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds) into [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) into [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar). Takimura was only able to muster three copies of [Catacomb Sifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Sifter)s.


While Tsumura's start was about all he could ask for, the [Catacomb Sifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Sifter)s allowed Takimura to buy time with the Eldrazi Scion tokens and scry through a good portion of his deck.

The board got clogged up a little bit as Tsumura added more creatures to the board along with creating a Gideon emblem. With damage coming through every turn, time was running short for the Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar* champion.


After scrying a couple of times and drawing a couple more cards, Takimura was unable to produce anything and fell to Tsumura's army a couple turns later.


**Tsumura 1—0 Takimura**


Tsumura came out of the gates quickly in the second game with a [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree). The Warden quickly got in 6 points of damage before Takimura was able to remove it with [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut).


When Tsumura cast and attacked with a second copy of [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree), Takimura responded with [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), bringing a pair of [Catacomb Sifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Sifter)s into play. Takimura double blocked the Warden and Tsumura followed the exchange up with [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino).


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Collected+Company)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company)
The game went back and forth from there: [Silkwrap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silkwrap) traded with a [Catacomb Sifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Sifter), [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance) took out an [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost). When the dust settled Takimura was left with a pair of Eldrazi Scion tokens.


Takimura was able to play and transform Jace and, with it, was able to flash back [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) putting a [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) into play. Tsumura found a [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) and used it to return Anafenza to his hand.


With Anafenza in play, Takimura was seemingly in a bad spot. Takimura had another idea, though. He cast [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors) for 3 and brought his entire graveyard back. He attacked with his Husk and forced Tsumura to chump block with his legend. With Anafenza dead and no answer to the Husk paired with creatures to feed on, Tsumura got ready for the third game.


**Tsumura 1—1 Takimura**


Tsumura started the third game off with an aggressive face up [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) on the second turn. His aggression payed off on his third turn when he used a [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) to power up the [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) and take out Takimura's newly minted [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy).

*Kenji Tsumura*


It came down to a classic race between combo deck and aggro deck: Tsumura added [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) to the battlefield while Takimura started to prepare with [Catacomb Sifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Sifter), [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk), and [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat).


Takimura had the [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors), but only a single source of White mana—a cost of casting his second turn Jace. Sitting at 5 life and facing down Tsumura's creatures he reached for the top of his deck. When it didn't yield a white source, Takimura extended his hand.


**Kenji Tsumura wins the match 2-1 over Kazuyuki Takimura.**
