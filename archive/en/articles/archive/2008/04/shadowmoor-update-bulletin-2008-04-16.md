*Shadowmoor* Update Bulletin
============================

With the *Shadowmoor* [Prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases)—a hybrid, persistent, conspiratorial, withering, untapping cavalcade of awesome new cards—just days away, it's time for me to unveil the latest bits of tinkering to the Oracle card database and the **Magic** Comprehensive rules.


These updates happen *only* when a new set is released, so corrections or improvements that have come to our attention over the past few months are being implemented now. In addition, some rules changes are necessary to make the new cards work.


Changes to the Oracle card database will go into effect on Friday, April 18.


Changes to the Comprehensive Rules will take effect on May 1, though any changes that are necessary for *Shadowmoor* cards to work will be in effect during the Prerelease. Bear in mind, however, that the new version of the Comp. Rules has not yet been finalized, so the listed amendments are subject to change.


### Functional Oracle Changes


**What is Oracle?**


**Magic** is a game made up of over 9,000 interchangeable pieces—the cards. Over the years, we've felt the need to update the wordings of older cards, whether because we've introduced a new keyword, or a card was printed with a mistake, or we have a clearer wording for what a card does, etc. Rather than sneak into your room at night and change your cards with a magic marker, we keep a database of the "modern wordings" (what the cards would say if we printed them today) of every tournament-legal card ever printed. These wordings are considered the official wordings of the cards, and accurately reflect their functions.You can access a card's Oracle wording by looking it up in [Gatherer](http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/Index.aspx).Oracle changes can be broken into two categories: functional changes and nonfunctional changes. If a card gets a functional change, that means the way it works after receiving errata is different, in some respect, to the way it worked immediately before receiving that errata. The main reasons a card will get a functional change is because it's brought to my attention that its Oracle wording doesn't work under the rules, doesn't match how the card was printed (and can match its printed wording better), or doesn't match how it originally functioned under the rules system in place when it was printed (and it's both desirable and possible to match that functionality better).


Nonfunctional errata is a change to the card's wording (or some other aspect of it) purely for cosmetic reasons. Usually this is done to bring the card in line with modern standards. It doesn't change what the card does.


The cards are presented in alphabetical order (with groups of cards ordered by their lead member), though you may want to skip right down to Mox Diamond.


**[Aladdin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aladdin)**  
[Aladdin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aladdin) functionally changed between *Arabian Nights* and *Chronicles*. The *Arabian Nights* version could target only an artifact an opponent controls, and it made you give back the stolen artifact when [Aladdin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aladdin) left play. The *Chronicles* version could target any artifact, and it made you give the artifact back when [Aladdin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aladdin) left your control. The Oracle wording was kind of a mashup between the two. Our general policy is to agree with the most recently printed wording.


*New Oracle text:*  

{o1oRoR}, {oT}: Gain control of target artifact as long as you control Aladdin.


**[Arcum's Sleigh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcum%27s+Sleigh)**  

As printed, [Arcum's Sleigh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcum%27s+Sleigh) seems to have a play restriction, and I wanted to restore that. Note that since the ability refers to the "defending player," who exists only during combat, it's really only worth playing this ability during your beginning of combat step.


*New Oracle text:*  

{o2}, {oT}: Target creature gains vigilance until end of turn. Play this ability only during combat and only if defending player controls a snow land.


**[Barrin's Spite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrin%27s+Spite) and [Cannibalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cannibalize)**  

The Oracle wordings on these cards are impossible. They say to choose a player (an action that happens as the spell resolves), then they say to target two creatures that player controls (which happens as you play the spell . . . long before you choose the player). They're getting new wordings that are much closer to the printed wordings.


*New [Barrin's Spite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrin%27s+Spite) Oracle text:*  

Choose two target creatures controlled by the same player. Their controller chooses and sacrifices one of them. Return the other to its owner's hand.


*New [Cannibalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cannibalize) Oracle text:*  

Choose two target creatures controlled by the same player. Remove one of those creatures from the game and put two +1/+1 counters on the other.


Also, these two cards have rulings that say that you determine which effect applies to which creature when you play the spell. That strikes me as highly counterintuitive; that determination should be made on resolution. The rulings stem from the first sentence of rule 409.1e, which shouldn't apply here but is written so broadly that it does. The updated Comp. Rules will rectify that.


**[Bronze Tablet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Tablet)**


The Oracle wording has a few inconsistencies with the printed wording:


1. The Oracle wording lets a card's controller—not its owner—decide whether or not to change its ownership.
2. The printed wording removed the cards from the game regardless of the life payment. The life payment should prevent only the exchange of ownership, not the removal of the cards.
3. The printed wordings said that if the other player doesn't pay 10 life, [Bronze Tablet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Tablet) is discarded / destroyed. Either way, it winds up in the graveyard.

The first point was a particular problem, as you could gain control of one of your opponent's cards (with Confiscate, perhaps), then use [Bronze Tablet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Tablet) to ask yourself if you could become the owner of your opponent's card. You'd probably say yes.


*New Oracle wording:*  

Remove Bronze Tablet from your deck before playing if you're not playing for ante.  

Bronze Tablet comes into play tapped.  

{o4}, {oT}: Remove Bronze Tablet and target nontoken permanent an opponent owns from the game. That player may pay 10 life. If he or she does, put Bronze Tablet into its owner's graveyard. Otherwise, that player owns Bronze Tablet and you own the other removed card.


**[Bubbling Muck](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bubbling+Muck)**  

This card wound up with a different Oracle wording than [High Tide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide). Worse, they were functionally different with respect to [Piracy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy)! (Yes, they pay me to think about these things.) The two cards will now be synched up, and I think [Bubbling Muck](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bubbling+Muck) will now interact as expected with [Piracy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy).


*New Oracle wording:*  

Until end of turn, whenever a player taps a Swamp for mana, that player adds {oB} to his or her mana pool.


**[Clockwork Avian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Avian)**  

In the [*Masters Edition* Oracle update](/en/articles/archive/masters-edition-update-bulletin-2007-08-29), [Clockwork Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Beast) got a new wording to better reflect its intended functionality. In the [*Lorwyn* Oracle update](/en/articles/archive/lorwyn-oracle-changes-2007-09-26), I realized that [Clockwork Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Steed) and [Clockwork Swarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Swarm) should have gotten the same update, so I did so. In this update, I realized that [Clockwork Avian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Avian+) should *also* have gotten the same update! Boy, I wish there was some way to search for these things . . . .


*New Oracle wording:*  

Flying  

Clockwork Avian comes into play with four +1/+0 counters on it.  

At end of combat, if Clockwork Avian attacked or blocked this turn, remove a +1/+0 counter from it.  

{oX}, {oT}: Put up to X +1/+0 counters on Clockwork Avian. This ability can't cause the total number of +1/+0 counters on Clockwork Beast to be greater than four. Play this ability only during your upkeep.


**[Forsaken Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forsaken+Wastes)**  

This card was printed with the ability "Players cannot gain life." It was long ago changed to a more conservative replacement ability: "If a player would gain life, that player gains no life instead." The replacement ability has more reasonable, more logical, and more intuitive interactions with certain cards. But I think the game can support "Players can't gain life," so the ability is being reverted to the printed functionality and the Comp. Rules are gaining a new rule to help out.


Also, the "when" that starts the third ability in Oracle is changing to "whenever" because the ability can trigger multiple times.


*New Oracle wording:*  

Players can't gain life.  

At the beginning of each player's upkeep, that player loses 1 life.  

Whenever Forsaken Wastes becomes the target of a spell, that spell's controller loses 5 life.


**[Helm of Obedience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Obedience)**  

The Oracle wording of this card has an unnecessarily complex "repeat this process" wording, and the cost of its activated ability is different that it was as printed. It can be simplified (and its printed ability cost can be restored) by cribbing a bit from [Thought Dissector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Dissector).


*New Oracle wording:*  

{oX}, {oT}: Target opponent puts cards from the top of his or her library into his or her graveyard until a creature card or X cards are put into that graveyard this way, whichever comes first. If a creature card is put into that graveyard this way, sacrifice Helm of Obedience and put that card into play under your control. X can't be 0.


The only functional change here is that the cost of its activated ability is changing from {o1oX} back to {oX}.


**[Hidden Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Spider)**  
*Urza's Saga* and *Urza's Legacy* had a number of "sleeping" enchantments—enchantments that "woke up" and became creatures when a certain condition was met. The conditions for a lot of these cards was "When one of your opponents successfully casts a [something or other]." I believe that phrase was retired with *Sixth Edition* rules, and most of these cards got errata to say "When an opponent plays a [something or other]."


[Hidden Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Spider) was the exception. "Plays a creature spell with flying" was too weird of a phrase, I guess, so it now triggered when a creature with flying came into play under an opponent's control. That's pretty functionally different, and it didn't match its kin. As it happens, I'm not one to shy away from a weird phrase.


*New Oracle wording:*  

When an opponent plays a creature spell with flying, if Hidden Spider is an enchantment, Hidden Spider becomes a 3/5 Spider creature with reach. *(It can block creatures with flying.)*


**[Merseine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merseine)**  

The last ability of this card's Oracle wording granted the enchanted creature an ability that refers to "a [Merseine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merseine)," which is a bad wording because [Merseine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merseine) is a card name, not a type. It would have to say "an Aura named [Merseine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merseine)," or the like. But the whole thing is difficult because the Aura grants an ability to the creature which is then trying to look back up at the Aura. The entire thing can, instead, be an ability of [Merseine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merseine), which is how the card worked as printed.


*New Oracle wording:*  

Enchant creature  

Merseine comes into play with three net counters on it.  

Enchanted creature doesn't untap during its controller's untap step as long as Merseine has a net counter on it.  

Pay enchanted creature's mana cost: Remove a net counter from Merseine. Any player may play this ability, but only if he or she controls the enchanted creature.


**[Mightstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mightstone)**  

As printed, it has a static ability. In Oracle, this became a triggered ability. But, as seen on [Orcish Oriflamme](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Oriflamme), this can be a static ability after all.


*New Oracle wording:*  

Attacking creatures get +1/+0.


**[Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond)**  
[Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond) was printed with the ability "When Mox Diamond comes into play, choose and discard a land card or sacrifice Mox Diamond." If you interpreted that ability under the modern rules system, you could play [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond), let the ability trigger, tap it for mana, then let the ability resolve and sacrifice it without discarding a land. It's one free mana! But under the rules system in place at the time [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond) was printed, you couldn't do that. When the rules system changed, [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond) got errata so it'd kinda work the same way. But that wording was a pretty significant functional change from how it was printed with regard to any effect that would put [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond) directly into play.


Other cards from [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond)'s era, like [Kjeldoran Outpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Outpost) and [Lotus Vale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Vale), got no-shenanigans wordings that prevented them from coming into play (and thus being tapped for mana) unless you fulfilled their sacrifice costs. [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond) is getting a wording like that, to keep it as true to its era and its printed wording as possible. (It's still not exactly the same as the printed functionality, but it's closer.)


*New Oracle wording:*  

If Mox Diamond would come into play, discard a land card instead. If you do, put Mox Diamond into play. If you don't, put it into its owner's graveyard.  

{oT}: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.


**[Puppet Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppet+Master)**  

As printed, you could pay mana and return [Puppet Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppet+Master) to its owner's hand only if the enchanted creature is put into a graveyard *and* that creature is returned to its owner's hand. But according to its Oracle wording, you could pay mana and return [Puppet Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppet+Master) to its owner's hand simply if the enchanted creature is put into a graveyard. The second condition had vanished; it's now being restored. Also, its Oracle wording says "a card named Puppet Master." It can simply say "Puppet Master."


*New Oracle wording:*  

Enchant creature  

When enchanted creature is put into a graveyard, return that card to its owner's hand. If that card is returned to its owner's hand this way, you may pay {oUoUoU}. If you do, return Puppet Master from your graveyard to your hand.


**[Raging River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+River)**



![Raging River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Raging+River)

There are a few problems with its Oracle wording (which is radically different than its printed wording, but is trying to get the gist of the card across):

1. As printed, defending creatures are divided between left and right when you attack. The Oracle wording does this before you attack.
2. The Oracle wording states that "east" creatures can't block "west" creatures and "west" creatures can't block "east" creatures as a static ability. It's always true. That makes it very unclear that the "east" and "west" choices I make for my creatures in separate abilities wear off. They don't have durations. Would they still apply during my turn?
3. If I put a creature without flying into play after the [Raging River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+River) ability resolves, it shouldn't be able to block at all, according to the printed wording. But according to the Oracle wording, it can.

So I'm trying to get back to the printed wording. Am I sure I've got it right? No. Am I sure this wording's "left" and "right" labels wear off? Not entirely, but since it's all one big triggered ability rather than three separate abilities, I'm certainly more inclined to believe so. (And I think people will play it as intended.) Am I delighted about introducing the word "label" to a card wording? Not especially. But while this may not be the best possible wording, it's gotta be a step in the right direction.


*New Oracle wording:*  

Whenever one or more creatures you control attack, each defending player divides all creatures without flying he or she controls into a "left" pile and a "right" pile. Then, for each attacking creature you control, choose "left" or "right." That creature can't be blocked this combat except by flying creatures and creatures in a pile with the chosen label.


**[Shared Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shared+Fate) and [Uba Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uba+Mask)**  

If some part of an effect is replaced due to a replacement effect, the source of the effect is unchanged. It doesn't switch over to where the replacement effect came from. This led us to errata [Void Maw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Maw) a while back. [Void Maw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Maw) said "If another creature would be put into a graveyard from play, remove it from the game instead." Then it referred to cards removed from the game "with" [Void Maw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Maw). But let's say [Void Maw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Maw) is in play and you [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) an [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog). [Void Maw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Maw) doesn't remove that [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) from the game . . . [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) removes it from the game! [Void Maw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Maw) just changed what [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)'s effect was. That meant that no cards would be removed from the game "with" [Void Maw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Maw), and its third ability would never work. It got errata so it could use counters to track the cards removed from the game this way.


[Shared Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shared+Fate) and [Uba Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uba+Mask) need errata for the same reason. This will change how they work if there are multiples out and one leaves play (for example), but their basic functionality is preserved as closely as possible.


*New [Shared Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shared+Fate) Oracle wording:*  

If a player would draw a card, that player removes the top card of an opponent's library from the game face down with a fate counter on it instead.  

Each player may look at and play each card with a fate counter on it he or she removed from the game.


*New [Uba Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uba+Mask) Oracle wording:*  

If a player would draw a card, that player removes that card from the game face up with a mask counter on it instead.  

Each player may play each card with a mask counter on it he or she removed from the game this turn.


**[Sheltered Valley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sheltered+Valley)**  

As mentioned in the [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond) section above, [Kjeldoran Outpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Outpost) got functionality-preserving errata to its first ability; you can't tap it for mana unless you make the necessary sacrifice. [Sheltered Valley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sheltered+Valley) is from the same set and also has a comes-into-play-and-sacrifice first ability, but it doesn't have the same errata. It's much less important here (you'll never sacrifice the new [Sheltered Valley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sheltered+Valley), so you can always wind up tapping it for mana), but the cards might as well match.


*New Oracle wording:*  

If Sheltered Valley would come into play, instead sacrifice each other permanent named Sheltered Valley you control, then put Sheltered Valley into play.  

At the beginning of your upkeep, if you control three or fewer lands, you gain 1 life.  

{oT}: Add {o1} to your mana pool.


**[Takklemaggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takklemaggot)**  

This card is perennially on the Rules Manager's "Most Wanted" list. It's just a troublemaker. I was looking at it because its Oracle wording says "a card named Takklemaggot" and could just say "Takklemaggot" instead. But as I was poking at it, exploring some other minor wording upgrades, it was pointed out that it had been affected by a major functional change. The printed [Takklemaggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takklemaggot) explicitly says "Control of Takklemaggot does not change when its target changes or when it becomes an enchantment." But the Oracle wording was changing its controller when it left play and came back! I understand why; it makes it much easier to handle who chooses the new creature, and who gets dealt damage when it comes back the last time. But I think we can more closely match the printed card's functionality.


*New Oracle wording:*  

Enchant creature  

At the beginning of the upkeep of enchanted creature's controller, put a -0/-1 counter on that creature.  

When enchanted creature is put into a graveyard, that creature's controller chooses a creature that Takklemaggot could enchant. If he or she does, return Takklemaggot to play under your control attached to that creature. If he or she doesn't, return Takklemaggot to play under your control as a non-Aura enchantment. It loses "enchant creature" and gains "At the beginning of that player's upkeep, Takklemaggot deals 1 damage to him or her."


**[Wall of Brambles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Brambles)**  

In the last Update Bulletin, I listed this creature as getting its creature type updated to Plant Wall. The only problem was that I forgot to actually change it in Oracle! Well, it's a Plant Wall—and this time, I mean it.


**Nonfunctional Oracle Changes**


**[Badlands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Badlands), [Plateau](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plateau), [Savannah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah), and [Tropical Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tropical+Island)**  

The land types listed on the type line weren't in standard color order in Oracle. They will be now.


**[Blood Oath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Oath), [Fertile Imagination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Imagination), [Mirror Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Golem), [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), and [Vigean Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigean+Intuition)**  

These cards each reference "card types" in some way, and each was printed with some helpful reminder text that said "The card types are," followed by a list. The problem, of course, is that we created some new card types!


During the *Tenth Edition* Oracle update, I ran into a quandary. [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) listed all the card types including tribal (which appeared in *Future Sight*) and planeswalker (which wouldn't appear until *Lorwyn*). The rest listed neither tribal nor planeswalker. So *all* the reminder text was wrong. I couldn't keep incorrect text in Oracle. I couldn't spoil the existence of planeswalkers. But I also couldn't delete "planeswalker" from [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)'s list, since that would undo the whole point of printing it with that sneak preview. In the end, I simply deleted the reminder text from all of these cards. If it's not there, it's not wrong! But since the reminder text is helpful if you look these cards up in Gatherer, I'm restoring it (in updated form, naturally).


**[Commandeer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commandeer)**  
[Commandeer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commandeer) has reminder text to remind you that if you target an artifact or enchantment spell, the resulting artifact or enchantment will come into play under your control when it resolves. As the same is now true for planeswalker spells, the reminder text is being updated accordingly.


**[Compost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compost) and [Planar Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Void)**  

These two cards trigger when a card is put into a graveyard, regardless of whether that card comes from in play, from a hand, from a library, etc. All other cards like this (for example, [Countryside Crusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Countryside+Crusher), [Nihilith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihilith), [Vulturous Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulturous+Zombie), and [Measure of Wickedness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Measure+of+Wickedness)) say "put into a graveyard from anywhere." So these are being updated to match.


*New [Compost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compost) Oracle wording:*  

Whenever a black card is put into an opponent's graveyard from anywhere, you may draw a card.


*New [Planar Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Void) Oracle wording:*  

Whenever a card is put into a graveyard from anywhere, remove that card from the game.


**[Daru Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Stinger)**  

Since [Daru Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Stinger) is now a Human Soldier, its amplify ability will let you reveal any number of Humans and any number of Soldiers from your hand to pump it up. Its reminder text is being updated accordingly.


**[Declaration of Naught](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+of+Naught), [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies)**  

These cards have you choose something as they come into play, then later refer to that something. They were printed with a nonstandard (but still functional and understandable) template. For consistency's sake, they're getting errata to match the standard wording.


*New [Declaration of Naught](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+of+Naught) Oracle wording:*  

As Declaration of Naught comes into play, name a card.  

{oU}: Counter target spell with the chosen name.


*New [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) Oracle wording:*  

As Door of Destinies comes into play, choose a creature type.  

Whenever you play a spell of the chosen type, put a charge counter on Door of Destinies.  

Creatures you control of the chosen type get +1/+1 for each charge counter on Door of Destinies.


**[Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), [Mana Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Flare), [Overabundance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overabundance), [Sasaya, Orochi Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sasaya%2C+Orochi+Ascendant), and [Winter's Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter%27s+Night)**  

Cards with triggered abilities that produce extra mana whenever a land is tapped for mana have historically inconsistent wordings. Four of the five cards listed above say that the player in question adds "one mana *of that type* to his or her mana pool." [Mirari's Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake), [Extraplanar Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extraplanar+Lens), and a card in a future set I can't tell you about say that the player in question "adds one mana to his or her mana pool *of any type that land produced*." And Overabundance says that the player in question "adds one mana to his or her mana pool *of the same type*."


It all means the same thing, but we'd like to have a consistent wording going forward. If the abilities do the same kind of thing, they should say the same kind of thing. Although [Mirari's Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake)'s wording is longer, it's clearer in two important ways: 1) It makes it quite clear that the permanent produces mana after (and thus separately from) the land that's been tapped, and 2) It tells you exactly what to do if the land you tapped produced multiple mana (if it was [Boros Garrison](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Garrison), for example).


*New [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) Oracle wording:*  

Whenever a player taps a land for mana, that player adds one mana to his or her mana pool of any type that land produced.


*New [Mana Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Flare) Oracle wording:*  

Whenever a player taps a land for mana, that player adds one mana to his or her mana pool of any type that land produced.


*New [Overabundance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overabundance) Oracle wording:*  

Whenever a player taps a land for mana, that player adds one mana to his or her mana pool of any type that land produced, and Overabundance deals 1 damage to him or her.


*New Sasaya's Essence (the flipped side of [Sasaya, Orochi Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sasaya%2C+Orochi+Ascendant)) Oracle wording:*  

Whenever a land you control is tapped for mana, for each other land you control with the same name, add one mana to your mana pool of any type that land produced.


*New [Winter's Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter%27s+Night) Oracle wording:*  

Whenever a player taps a snow land for mana, that player adds one mana to his or her mana pool of any type that land produced. That land doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.


[Winter's Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter%27s+Night) got two other updates. The mana symbols in its mana cost were put in proper order, and it got the same fix with regard to [Piracy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy) as [Bubbling Muck](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bubbling+Muck) did. (That means [Winter's Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter%27s+Night) actually belongs in the "functional changes" section, but putting this entire section up there just for that one change would be pretty misleading.)


**[Jihad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jihad)**  

We don't use the word "cards" to refer to permanents. Instead, [Jihad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jihad)'s getting a functionally equivalent wording.


*New Oracle wording:*  

As Jihad comes into play, choose a color and an opponent.  

White creatures get +2/+1.  

When the chosen opponent controls no nontoken permanents of the chosen color, sacrifice Jihad.


**[Kongming, "Sleeping Dragon"](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kongming%2C+%22Sleeping+Dragon%22) and [Pang Tong, "Young Phoenix"](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pang+Tong%2C+%22Young+Phoenix%22)**  

These two cards didn't have quotation marks in their names in Oracle. That's been corrected.


**[Nameless Race](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Race) and [Seer's Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seer%27s+Vision)**  

62 cards in Oracle say "each opponent" somewhere in their wordings. Another 43 say "your opponents." But only these two said "all opponents." It's a nonstandard template, and each one is easily updated to say "your opponents."


**[Parallel Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallel+Evolution)**  

This template has gotten tweaked in Oracle before to keep it updated to the current standard. With the new card [Rhys the Redeemed](/en/node/634056), it's getting updated again.


*New Oracle wording:*  

For each creature token in play, its controller puts a token into play that's a copy of that creature.  

Flashback {o4oGoGoG} *(You may play this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then remove it from the game.)*


**[Phyrexian Driver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Driver)**  

This creature gives +1/+1 to Mercenaries. Once noncreature cards started getting creature types, this kind of wording was updated to specify that it gives the bonus only to creatures. So this creature will now give +1/+1 to Mercenary creatures.


**[Precognition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precognition)**  

This card's Oracle wording ran together two optional effects, and it was a bit messy. It gets easier to parse with an "if you do" inserted in the middle.


*New Oracle wording:*  

At the beginning of your upkeep, you may look at the top card of target opponent's library. If you do, you may put that card on the bottom of that player's library.


**[Primal Clay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Clay)**  

This card and [Primal Plasma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Plasma) have different wordings. They're being synched up.


*New Oracle wording:*  

As Primal Clay comes into play, it becomes your choice of a 3/3 artifact creature, a 2/2 artifact creature with flying, or a 1/6 Shapeshifter Wall artifact creature with defender.


**[Ranger *en*-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+en-Vec), [Scalebane's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalebane%27s+Elite), [Scarwood Goblins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarwood+Goblins), and [Wood Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wood+Sage)**  

The mana symbols in the mana costs of these cards weren't in color order in Oracle. They will be now.


**[Revered Unicorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revered+Unicorn)**  

The Oracle wording of its triggered ability said that "its controller gains life." It can just say "you gain life." Since the ability triggers when [Revered Unicorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revered+Unicorn) leaves play, there's no way for the controller of the ability and the last controller of the Unicorn to be different people.


**[Scandalmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scandalmonger)**  

The "play only as a sorcery" rider on [Scandalmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scandalmonger)'s ability had a slightly nonstandard wording. It's being updated to the norm.


**[Vigor Mortis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis)**  

This card puts a creature into play with a +1/+1 counter on it, and that's what it said: "with *a* +1/+1 counter on it." However, the *Morningtide* cards with this type of ability, such as [Sage of Fables](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+of+Fables), say "with *an additional* +1/+1 counter on it." It's much clearer in the cases when that creature would be coming into play with some +1/+1 counters already. So [Vigor Mortis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis) is getting updated to match.


### Comprehensive Rules Changes


**What are the Comprehensive Rules?**


**Magic** is complicated. No, really. When you have over 9,000 interchangeable game pieces, you get some freaky interactions. The Comprehensive Rules cover everything the game has ever come up with, from basic game play structure, to every keyword ever, to entire pages dedicated to single bizarre cards (hello, [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver)!) The Comprehensive Rules are, well, comprehensive... but they're also obtuse, unfriendly, and looooong. They're not intended to be a player resource—they're a judge resource, a rules guru resource, and a place to store definitive answers. In fact, I recommend never reading them. For a much friendlier rulebook that *is* intended to be a player resource, check out the [Rules Page](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/rules) and download the Basic Rulebook (2MB PDF), now with an appendix on planeswalker rules. It doesn't have sections about phasing or subgames... but you'll never miss them.**Introduction**  

The Comp. Rules has described itself as a "booklet" for years. This is no longer true; it'll now describe itself as a "document."


**104.1b**  

This section is getting edited a bit, but the content isn't changing.


**104.3, 104.3f**  

These sections are getting updated to include the monocolored hybrid symbols.


**104.5**  

This section is begin added to cover the untap symbol (depicted as {Q} in rules documents). The old 104.5, 104.6, and 104.7 are being renumbered to 104.6, 104.7, and 104.8, respectively.


**203.2e**  

This is getting a slight wording tweak for clarity.


**203.3c**  

This section is being added to cover how to determine the converted mana cost of a card that includes hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost.


**212.3f**  

This is the "summoning sickness" rule. It's being updated to include abilities with the untap symbol in their costs.


**212.3g**  

This rule is being added to explicitly cover how damage interacts with creatures. The old 212.3g is being renumbered as 212.3h.


**215.4a**  

The rules weren't clear about how much life you're allowed to pay in a Two-Headed Giant game. Say your team is at 10 life and you play [Hatred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hatred). Are you allowed to pay up to 10 life, or are you allowed to pay up to 5 life (half your team's total)? The new rule says that you can pay an amount equal to or less than the team's life total.


**215.7**  

This rule covers some ramifications of an effect that says that you can't gain life.


**216.1**  

Pure grammar: "whomever" is changing to "whoever."


**403.4**  

This rule is being updated to take the untap symbol into account.


**409.1b**  

This is the rule that talks about the choices you make when playing a spell or ability, such as modes, the value of X, additional costs, and alternative costs. because hybrid, in some sense, presents you with various alternative costs (all your options are alternatives to one another), the rule will now specify that this is when you determine how you'll be paying the hybrid cost. This makes hybrid costs (especially monocolored hybrid costs) interact sensibly with cost-reduction effects, since you determine how you'll pay first, then you determine whether the cost is reduced (and how), then you pay. It also matches how **Magic Online** handles hybrid costs.


**409.1c, 409.1e**  

The first sentence of 409.1e has you specify which target is which as you're playing a spell or ability. But it's written so broadly that it seems to apply to [Cannibalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cannibalize) and [Barrin's Spite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrin%27s+Spite). That sentence is being deleted from 409.1e, and an appropriate replacement is being put into 409.1c. You'll specify which target is which as you select them.


**409.1f**  

A cross-reference to 409.1b is being added with regard to a spell or ability's mana cost, activation cost, or alternative cost.


**409.2**  

Continuing along with the change to [Barrin's Spite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrin%27s+Spite)'s ruling, the third point in the list following "such as" is being deleted.


**410.10d**  

This rule currently covers cards put into a hand or library from any zone; it should cover only cards put into a hand or library from a zone that everyone can see.


**419.9c**  

This rule is being added to cover especially complex replacement and prevention abilities, such as those seen on [Guile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guile) and [Swans of Bryn Argoll](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/shadowmoor/spoiler).


**423.3**  

This rule is being expanded to explicitly cover what happens if an effect says that you can't draw cards.


**502.5b**  

This is the primary rule for haste. It's being updated to include abilities with the untap symbol in their costs.


**502.59a**  

This is the primary rule for suspend. It's being updated so that if you suspend and then play [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor+) via [Jhoira of the Ghitu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhoira+of+the+Ghitu), the [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor+) will have haste. (It's not covered by the current rule because the rule specifically covers creature spells, and [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) isn't a spell.)


**502.78**  

This rule is being added to cover conspire.


**502.79**  

This rule is being added to cover persist.


**502.80**  

This rule is being added to cover wither.


**600.4b, 600.4c**  

These rules cover some unusual cases that may arise when a player leaves a multiplayer game. They're getting some tweaks for clarity and functionality.


**605.4, 607.5, 608.6, 609.5**  

These rules each cover winning and losing the game in a multiplayer game. They're being updated to take rule 601.15 into account.


**Ability word**  

The Glossary entry for "Ability word" will now keep a running list of them. If you're curious, to date this list contains: channel, grandeur, hellbent, kinship, radiance, sweep, threshold.
