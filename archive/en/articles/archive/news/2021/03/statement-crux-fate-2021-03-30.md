It has come to our attention that the card Crux of Fate from the *Strixhaven: School of Mages* Mystical Archive may overtly feature *Magic: The Gathering* fan art and the contracted artist did not receive permission for this incorporation. These actions do not reflect the values of Wizards, and, as a result, we will be suspending future work with Jason Felix until we have been able to bring this matter to successful conclusion.
