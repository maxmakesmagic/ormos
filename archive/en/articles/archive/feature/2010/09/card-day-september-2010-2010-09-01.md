![Argent Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Argent+Sphinx)**[Argent Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argent+Sphinx)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* rare. From the [*Scars of Mirrodin* FAQ](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/Resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs): "If you control an Argent Sphinx owned by another player and activate its ability, Argent Sphinx will return to the battlefield under your control at the beginning of the next end step. You'll retain control of it indefinitely."
 ![Echo Circlet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Echo+Circlet)**[Echo Circlet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echo+Circlet)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* common. From the [*Scars of Mirrodin* FAQ](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/Resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs): "Echo Circlet's effect is cumulative. If it equips a creature that can already block an additional creature, now it can block three creatures. The same is true if two Echo Circlets equip the same creature, for example."
 ![Flesh Allergy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Flesh+Allergy)**[Flesh Allergy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh+Allergy)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* uncommon. From the [*Scars of Mirrodin* FAQ](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/Resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs): "Flesh Allergy counts each creature put into a graveyard from the battlefield that turn, including token creatures, the creature sacrificed to cast the spell, and the targeted creature (if it is destroyed)."
 ![Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Glint+Hawk+Idol)**[Glint Hawk Idol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* common. From the [*Scars of Mirrodin* FAQ](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/Resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs): "The creature type "Bird" was inadvertently omitted from each of Glint Hawk Idol's abilities. It has received errata to correct this omission; when either of its abilities resolves, it will become a Bird artifact creature."
 ![To Arms!](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=To+Arms%21)**[To Arms!](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=To+Arms%21)** – *Guildpact* uncommon. [To Arms!](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=To+Arms%21) is contained in the card names [Call to Arms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Arms) and [Farewell to Arms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farewell+to+Arms), except for the exclamation point. Those things make all the difference!
 ![Tomorrow, Azami's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tomorrow%2C+Azami%27s+Familiar)**[Tomorrow, Azami's Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tomorrow%2C+Azami%27s+Familiar)** – *Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. [Azami, Lady of Scrolls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azami%2C+Lady+of+Scrolls) is the [head librarian](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/chk/azami) of the largest library on Kamigawa. So it makes sense that her familiar has an ability reminiscent of [Sylvan Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library).
 ![Incoming!](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Incoming%21)**[Incoming!"](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incoming%21%22+)**  – *Unglued* rare. The boot prints in the text box for [Incoming!](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incoming%21) were left there by the person standing in the art. When he saw how many enemies he'd be facing, he naturally ran away.
 ![Mirrodin's Core](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mirrodin%27s+Core)**[Mirrodin's Core](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrodin%27s+Core)** – *Darksteel* uncommon. Want to see more of Mirrodin's Core? Check out [this Arcana from 2004](/en/articles/archive/style-guide-mirrodins-interior-2004-03-17), which shows the core of Mirrodin as portrayed in the *Mirrodin* Style Guide.
 ![Scars of the Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scars+of+the+Veteran)**[Scars of the Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scars+of+the+Veteran)** – *Alliances* uncommon. Although its original physical printing appeared in 1996 in *Alliances*, [Scars of the Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scars+of+the+Veteran) showed up in the *Coldsnap* preconstructed deck [Kjeldoran Cunning](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/displaythemedeck.asp?set=coldsnap&decknum=3&lang=en) in 2006 and in [*Masters Edition II*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo) in 2008.
 ![Helix Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Helix+Pinnacle)**[Helix Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helix+Pinnacle)** – *Eventide* rare. Although it's not in the actual rules, it seems logical that the "100 or more tower counters" really ought to be stacked up in an imposing and rickety tower themselves, doesn't it?
 ![Zur the Enchanter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zur+the+Enchanter)**[Zur the Enchanter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zur+the+Enchanter)** – *Coldsnap* rare. Zur appeared in flavor text in *Ice Age* and had a group of followers (called [Zuran Enchanter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zuran+Enchanter)s), but he's probably most famous for inventing the [Zuran Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zuran+Orb).
 ![Decimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Decimate)**[Decimate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decimate)** – *Odyssey* rare. From the [Gatherer rulings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=31798): You no longer need four distinct targets for Decimate. If the spell or ability uses the word target in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word "target." For example, you could choose [Tree of Tales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tree+of+Tales) for both the artifact and the land. You still need an enchantment and a creature to target.
 ![Blastoderm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blastoderm)**[Blastoderm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blastoderm)** – *Nemesis* common. In *Planar Chaos*, [Blastoderm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blastoderm) was color-shifted into white and appeared as [Calciderm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Calciderm). It looked a little different from most color-shifted cards, because "fading 3" was changed to the nearly-identical "vanishing 4". (How are they different? Well, [Calciderm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Calciderm) has an extra turn where proliferate could happen...)
 ![Bloodscent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bloodscent)**[Bloodscent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodscent)** – *Mirrodin* uncommon. [Bloodscent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodscent) is a lot like the *Portal* card [Alluring Scent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Scent), except that it costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) instead of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif), and it's an instant. Are you wondering when you'd need to use this ability as an instant? One word: Multiplayer!
 ![Fear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fear)**[Fear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fear)** – *Tenth Edition* common. When the ability "cannot be blocked by any creatures other than artifact creatures and black creatures" got named "fear," it created a self-referential card. It worked the other way with [Lifelink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifelink), which became a keyword and *then* a card.
 ![River of Tears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=River+of+Tears)**[River of Tears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+of+Tears)** – *Future Sight* rare. Because the "future-shifted" cards in *Future Sight* came from many possible futures, there was no need to make perfectly symmetrical cycles. So there were [five types of dual land](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=%7C%5B%22Nimbus%20Maze%22%5D%7C%5B%22River%20of%20Tears%22%5D%7C%5B%22Graven%20Cairns%22%5D%7C%5B%22Grove%20of%20the%20Burnwillows%22%5D%7C%5B%22Horizon%20Canopy%22%5D), of which only one has been so far been reprinted.
 ![Kentaro, the Smiling Cat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kentaro%2C+the+Smiling+Cat)**[Kentaro, the Smiling Cat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kentaro%2C+the+Smiling+Cat)** – *Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. The entire Kamigawa block is full of Legends. And legends. By that, we mean to say that most of the Legendary cards have legends about them. Look, [here's a story about Kentaro](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/bok/kentaro), okay?
 ![Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Solemn+Simulacrum)**[Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum)** – *Mirrodin* rare. When Jens Thoren won the [2002 **Magic** Invitational](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=sideboard/events/mi02), the card he designed as his prize was just like its final version. Except that it was called "Forestfolk" ... and it cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif). Yeah, R&D made it a bit better.
 ![Korlash, Heir to Blackblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Korlash%2C+Heir+to+Blackblade)**[Korlash, Heir to Blackblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Korlash%2C+Heir+to+Blackblade)** – *Future Sight* rare. Most of our [wallpapers](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-archive-2008-08-23) are based on cards' regular art. But when we did [wallpaper based on Korlash](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-korlash-heir-blackblade-2007-04-20), we used the [alternate Prerelease card art](/en/articles/archive/future-sight-prerelease-card-2007-04-16).
 ![Infernal Spawn of Infernal Spawn of Evil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil)**[Infernal Spawn of Infernal Spawn of Evil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil)** – *Unhinged* rare. The original [Infernal Spawn of Evil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil) in *Unglued* had the creature type "Demon" crossed out and "Beast" added in, a reference to **Magic**'s policy at the time against having demons. By the time *Unhinged* came out, that policy was history, so the Infernal Spawn's Infernal Spawn had "Beast" replaced by "Demon".
 ![Sarpadian Empires, Vol. VII](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sarpadian+Empires%2C+Vol.+VII)***[Sarpadian Empires, Vol. VII](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarpadian+Empires%2C+Vol.+VII)*** – *Time Spiral* rare. The first six volumes of *Sarpadian Empires* are told via the flavor text in *Fallen Empires.* For a complete compilation of the story, check out [this Arcana](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1178)!
