The [Unflinching Courage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unflinching+Courage) of Craig Wescoe's Selesnya army led it to trample over Josh Utter-Leyton's Boros brigade, three games to one.


"I think your deck, after sideboarding, is the 60 I would play to beat mine," Utter-Leyton said presciently, before falling three times to the bevy of big bodies in Wescoe's deck.


"I knew post-sideboard I'd be a favorite because of life gain," Wescoe explained. He also went on to say that Utter-Leyton could come out quickly and steal a win before Wescoe develops his lands. It's not quite what happened in the third game, which Utter-Leyton won after Wescoe drew nothing but lands the entire way, but it was a real concern on Wescoe's mind.


"You have some real hands," Wescoe said, regarding the explosive starts that Boros Blitz could deliver.


"Yeah. Turn three: you're dead," Utter-Leyton confirmed. "I think on the play with the best draw I'm favored, but if you mulligan to five cards I'm only a slight favorite."

*Josh Utter-Leyton's Boros Blitz deck was fast, but he knew that his red creatures would have a ton of problems against Wescoe's Selesnya Aggro deck, especially after sideboarding.* 
The first two games demonstrated how efficiently Wescoe's deck could hold back Utter-Leyton's. 3/3 Centaur tokens, and often an [Experiment One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One) quickly evolved to the same size, presented a wall Utter-Leyton couldn't attack through. Life-gaining auras allowed Wescoe attack successfully while simultaneously keeping his life out of Utter-Leyton's reach. Complicating things further for Utter-Leyton was his missing mana in the second game.


"Probably a different game if you got your second mana a turn earlier," Wescoe said.


"Or my third," Utter-Leyton shared, lamenting his missed first opportunity on the play.


Mana turned the tables on Wescoe in the third game, where drawing far too many finally allowed Utter-Leyton to overrun the board.


"That's one you can win," Wescoe said.


"Yeah, the all land hand," said Utter-Leyton.


"Lands for five draw steps," confirmed Wescoe, and they shuffled for the final battle where Wescoe's [Unflinching Courage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unflinching+Courage) would carry [Experiment One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One) to victory for him.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptdgm13/qf_leyton.jpg)  
*Utter-Leyton received a breather when his opponent drew all lands in the third game.* 
Wescoe's last Pro Tour Top 8 appearance was Worlds 2011 in San Francisco, featuring a different aggressive white-based deck. In fact, he has made the Top 8 of 2010's Pro Tour San Diego before it, making today the third consecutive California-based Pro Tour Wescoe has done so. Known for favoring an aggressive route, it's no surprise to see [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) on his side of the battlefield.


Like some of his teammates, Utter-Leyton had chosen a hyper-aggressive deck for the tournament and it had served him well. Bringing opportunities to win a game before your opponent can do much of anything is a solid plan in any format, and it was Utter-Leyton's hope to do that against Wescoe.


Game 1's blistering pace set the tone for the match, with Wescoe's [Judge's Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar), [Selesnya Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Charm) for a 2/2 Knight, and [Call of the Conclave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Conclave) for a 3/3 Centuar raced against Utter-Leyton's [Rakdos Cackler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Cackler) and pair of [Gore-House Chainwalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gore-House+Chainwalker)s. Though Utter-Leyton cast [Mizzium Mortars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars) twice, once for [Loxodon Smiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter) and another for a 3/3 Centaur, his [Battlefield Medic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic) and [Foundry Street Denizen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foundry+Street+Denizen) couldn't hold off Wescoe's 5/5 token from [Advent of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptdgm13/qf_wescoe.jpg)  
*Wescoe's 3/3 creatures and 5/5 wurm tokens steamrolled past Utter-Leyton's 2/2 army.* 
Game 2 was a step slower, due to missing mana for both sides. With his second mana appearing a turn late, and the third never to be found, Utter-Leyton's explosive double [Burning-Tree Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary) into [Firefist Striker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firefist+Striker) let him attack Wescoe down to 8 life. After an [Experiment One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One) from Wescoe blocked the Striker, he stabilized behind [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) and two 3/3 Centaur tokens from a pair of [Call of the Conclave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Conclave)s.


Wescoe played [Gift of Orzhova](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Orzhova) on one of the Centuars, allowing him recover a significant chunk of life before Utter-Leyton's [Mizzium Mortars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars) ended it. The follow up [Trostani, Selesnya's Voice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trostani%2C+Selesnya%27s+Voice) and combat trick-timed [Advent of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm) put Wescoe's life well out of reach for Utter-Leyton, who fell to a 5/5 Wurm the following turn.


Through it all, both players stayed positive, and even traded a few jokes. "How many congratulations do you think Ochoa will get this week?" Wescoe asked, referring to Utter-Leyton's ChannelFireball teammate David Ochoa, who shares his last name with Dusty Ochoa...who Wescoe would go on the play in the Finals.


"A lot," Utter-Leyton laughed. "The real question is what's the percentage between serious and joking?"


"I'll try to remember to troll him," Wescoe said.


In the third game, Utter-Leyton's mana wasn't shorted as he exploded on the second turn thanks to two copies of [Burning-Tree Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary) into [Gore-House Chainwalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gore-House+Chainwalker), and a third turn [Battlefield Medic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic). Wescoe wasn't outdone himself, with [Experiment One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One) into [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence), [Dryad Militant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Militant), and [Call of the Conclave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Conclave) to give himself an equally sized army. Mizzium Morters for the Centaur gave Utter-Leyton a window to attack Wescoe down to 12.


With four mana open on Wescoe's side, Utter-Leyton took time to decide his next attack before adding [Viashino Firstblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Firstblade) and sending everyone in. Utter-Leyton's were creatures indestructible again, thanks to [Battlefield Medic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic), as Wescoe lost more life and another blocker. After falling from 12 to 6, and finally 2 life and losing all but his [Experiment One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One), Wescoe conceded to show his hand of four lands, matching the five he already had in play.


The final game wasn't a close contest. With Wescoe leading off, [Experiment One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One) grew alongside [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence), then was granted [Unflinching Courage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unflinching+Courage). Thanks to the life gained from his enhanced Experiment, Wescoe never dropped below 20 life before [Advent of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm), and a populated token through [Druid's Deliverance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Druid%27s+Deliverance), finished trampling Utter-Leyton's life total.


"Good luck in the Finals," Utter-Leyton offered with a handshake.


"Congratulations on Player of the Year," Wescoe shared back.
