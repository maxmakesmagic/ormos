 Right now former Rookie of the Year Matthias Hunt is sitting at 6-0 with a fairly unlikely deck. I saw "fairly" because people have certainly tried to tame the [Chromanticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromanticore) before. But like Excalibur from the stone, perhaps it took someone like Hunt to unleash it upon the world. How did he do it? Simple: "Well, it's not really a [Chromanticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromanticore) deck. In fact, I hate that this is going to be known as a [Chromanticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromanticore) deck. It's basically a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) deck with four [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time)." When you consider your deck a mix of two of the best cards in Standard, you're probably on the right track.




 But too bad, Matthias, too bad. You mess with the 'core, you get the horns. I watched a game against White-Blue Heroic that went: [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight), [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End), [Sultai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Charm), then bestow [Chromanticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromanticore) on the Courser, earning the scoop. The crowd goes wild; a [Chromanticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromanticore) deck it is.




 The deck started on the plane home from a StarCityGames event. "I saw so many Sidisi Whip mirrors, I wanted to figure out how to beat that deck." He started playing around and developed some theoretical shells, but there was a problemâ€”it included [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). "And if you know me at all, you know I hate [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). I like unfair *Magic*, and Rhino is the definition of 'fair *Magic*'." He continued, "But if I was going to go over to the dark side, how could I get it right? What if I played four [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time)? Can I do that?" Apparently he did.
