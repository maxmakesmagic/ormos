 Our second sample sealed pool is a bit challenging. Firstly, three of the rares are landsâ€”so the bombs are relatively light. Additionally, the powerful cards seem to pull in different directions. [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) and [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros) certainly pull towards white, but what color pairs best with it? Are we sure white's the way to go? We'll see how various pros deal with this pool in the coming rounds.
