**Name:** Michael Elliott

**Age:** 41

**Job title and duties:** Senior Designer, Collation Manager. Duties include: designing new TCG game systems, designing card sets and individual card applications for existing TCG lines. 

**Family:** Married (apologies to all the groupies who follow game designers).

**Education:** MS, Biological Sciences.

**Began working at Wizards:** January 1996.

**Previous job:** Night supervisor in pathology at a large hospital.

**How you got your job here:** Recruited at a convention by Joel Mick, former VP of brand. Got into **Magic** through several friends I used to play tournament Bridge with.

**Expansions or projects you've worked on:**
 *Mirage* (developer), *Visions* (developer), *Weatherlight* (design, lead developer), *Tempest* (design, developer), *Stronghold* (lead design, lead developer), *Exodus* (lead design, developer), *Urza’s Saga* (lead design, lead developer), *Urza’s Legacy* (Lead design, developer), *Unglued* (design), *Urza’s Destiny* (lead developer), *Mercadian Masques* (lead design, developer), *Nemesis* (lead design, developer), *Fifth Edition* (lead design/developer), *Prophecy* (developer), *Invasion* (design), *Vanguard* I/II (lead design), *Planeshift* (lead design), *Apocalypse* (lead developer), *Odyssey* (developer), *Torment* (design), *Judgment* (design, developer), *Onslaught* (lead design), *Legions* (lead design), *Scourge* (developer), *Mirrodin* (design). **Non-Magic projects**: **Duel Masters** (original game design), **Neopets** (lead design), **Harry Potter** (design), ***Star Wars* TCG** (design, development), **Simpsons** (Lead design), **Netrunner** (design), **X-Men TCG** (Lead developer), **Pokémon** (WotC lead 2000-2001), **Earthquake** card game (design), **Instinct** card game (design).

**Favorite part of your job:** Arguing with Mark and Randy, designing cards.

**Least favorite part of your job:** Collation, it’s a completely thankless job.

**Thing you've worked on that you're most proud of:** Slivers, one of the most popular race decks ever.

**Other games you currently enjoy playing:** Ticu (very obscure German card game), *Ra*, bridge (although I almost never get to play these days, at some point I would like to go back to playing).

**Favorite Magic card(s):** 
[Living Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death), [Portcullis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Portcullis), wacky game altering effects. In general I like cards that you start with and build a deck around.
