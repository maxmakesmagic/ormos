You’ve probably [seen the set](/en/articles/archive/time-spiral-sortable-spoiler-2006-09-25) by now, so you’ve seen how many *Time Spiral* cards produce creature tokens. We’ve already shown you [two](/en/articles/archive/time-spiral-token-art-1-2006-09-11) [sprinklings](/en/articles/archive/time-spiral-token-art-2-2006-09-14) of the token art that you can expect to see on ***Magic** Online*, and today we dole a scoop more onto that virtual-creature sundae.


*[Sarpadian Empires, Vol. VII](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarpadian+Empires%2C+Vol.+VII)* generates five differently-typed tokens—Citizens, Camarids, Thrulls, Goblins and Saprolings—all of which you’ve seen before. ([The first](/en/articles/archive/time-spiral-token-art-1-2006-09-11) Arcana of *Time Spiral* token art depicted a Camarid token.) That card takes type variety to an extreme, but there are definitely more token-creators. 


[Triskelavus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus), an artifact creature love-child of [Triskelion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion) and [Tetravus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tetravus), has its own token, for example. Here’s the Triskelavite token generated by [Triskelavus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus).

Remember *Judgment’s* [Elephant Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Guide)? How it provided a +3/+3 accompaniment to one of your creatures? Now *Time Spiral’s* [Griffin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide) provides—what else?—a +2/+2 and flying bonus, with the same ability to create a creature token if the enchanted creature dies.

One of Dominaria’s most durable residents, the kobold, persists in *Time Spiral* after so many apocalypses. Here’s the art for the token generated by Kher Keep.
