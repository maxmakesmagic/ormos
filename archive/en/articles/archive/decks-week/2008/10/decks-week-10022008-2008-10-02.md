And we're back! Hope you enjoyed your Prelease events for the brand spanking new *Shards of Alara* and don't forget about the upcoming [Release Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases). In preparation for the upcoming States tournaments as well as an all new Standard format, we bring you all the lists from premier events on **Magic Online**. They'll provide a great jumping off point as we move into a brave new world (or should we say five new worlds?). Of course, if you're looking for the hottest tech for your next premier queue, you've also come to the right spot.


Enjoy!
