Grand Prix Albuquerque
----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpabq13/winner.jpg)Congratulations to Owen Turtenwald, Winner of Grand Prix Albuquerque!


Owen Turtenwald has been one of the best players in the game for some time now. Until recently, trophies seemed to elude the young master. It's never too late to make up for lost time, though. Last weekend, Turtenwald proved his greatness by winning Grand Prix Washington D.C.. This weekend, Turtenwald made history by winning back-to-back Grand Prix events. Turtenwald joins an elite class of players that have achieved two Grand Prix victories in a row. Only five other players (Kenji Tsumura, Kai Budde, Raphael Levy, Tomoharu Saito, and Yuuya Watanabe) have ever accomplished this feat.


The last spell has been cast, the last attack declared, and history has been made here at Grand Prix Albuquerque.
