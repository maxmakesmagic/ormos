### Seer

The seer sat before me,  
 Wrapped gently in smoke and satin.  
 A small smile in purple-painted lips  
 Peeked out from under her silk veil.  
 Her crystal on the table before her  
 Swam in an inner light  
 That set my heart pattering.  
 "What is it you want to know?" she asked.  
 I swallowed the rock in my throat.  
 "Tell me, O seer, how will the world end?"

Her smile widened.  
 Her white, white teeth  
 Gleamed at me.  
 "That is a deep question, my dear,  
 As deep as Inkfathom, and just as cold.  
 The answer  
 Will surely not bring you any joy."  
 "I know," I replied,  
 "But know I must."  
 Even if I did not know why.

Her smile dazzled once more,  
 As if I had made light wit.  
 "You are not ready for my answer.  
 Perhaps there are other things   
 You wish to know?"  
 I nodded.  
 Her hands embraced the crystal.  
 The light within it  
 Swam and jumped  
 Writhed and stretched.  
 "Then ask."

### Evolution

[![Overbeing_of_Myth](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/EVE/Overbeing_of_Myth.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Overbeing%2Bof%2BMyth)"Tell me, seer:  
 Where did this world come from?"

"I see a void  
 Deeper than the night  
 That now enshrouds us.  
 It is all.  
 It is absolute.  
 It is limitless.  
 Nothing dies,  
 For nothing is born,  
 Nothing fears  
 For nothing thinks.  
 But such perfection  
 Cannot last.

Was she born of the void?  
 Or did she arrive  
 From some other place  
 Unknown,  
 Impossibly far?  
 She hungers,  
 Not for meat,  
 But for knowledge.  
 Her eyes  
 Ring round  
 Spin,  
 Drink greedily  
 Of everything around her.  
 Her hands itch,  
 Yearn,  
 Constantly grasping  
 For what is out of reach,  
 For the unknown.  
 Her feet do not touch  
 Any ground  
 As she glides  
 Towards the next discovery  
 The next new being  
 The next satisfaction.

When she beheld  
 This perfect void,  
 She wept.  
 What was there to see?  
 What was there to do?  
 What was there to learn?  
 Nothing  
 Except herself  
 And the black.  
 Her brow furrowed,  
 But only for a moment.  
 If she could not find  
 What she was looking for,  
 Perhaps she could make it herself.

She spoke words  
 In a language never created,  
 Wove magics  
 With her hands the loom,  
 Her essence the thread.  
 She made this world  
 In her own image.  
 From her hunger  
 Sprang the boggarts,  
 Her joy  
 Created the elves,  
 Her caution  
 The kithkin,  
 Her anger  
 The cinders,  
 Her despair,  
 The giants,  
 Her ambition,  
 The merrow,  
 Her mischief,  
 The fae  
 Her stoutness,  
 The treefolk.  
 She tried to wreathe  
 This world in light,  
 But the void,   
 Angered at the disruption  
 Of its blanket,  
 Fought back.

And even when it won,  
 She did not despair.  
 In fact, she rejoiced.  
 Her sired things altered  
 In such interesting ways,  
 That she had new purpose.  
 She walks among us unseen,  
 Learning from our imperfections,  
 Watching over her creations.  
 As all things sprang from her,  
 Is she watching  
 For the time  
 When all must return to her?"

### Destruction

[![Deus_of_Calamity](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/SHM/Deus_of_Calamity.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Deus%2Bof%2BCalamity)"Tell me, seer:  
 What causes   
 The mighty quakes  
 That scare my children  
 And send me tumbling?" 

"I see a juggernaut  
 Greater than giants  
 And far older still.  
 He sleeps beneath the earth  
 Among those whom once he slew.  
 He bears the marks of ages upon his skin,  
 Memories of dreams long dead  
 And best left buried.  
 Whenever cracks split the ground,  
 An old peak falls,  
 Or hills roll like water,  
 That is the demiurge  
 Muttering in his slumber.

But one day his sleep will end,  
 As any sleep but death must.  
 He shall rise  
 From his forgotten bed.  
 His is an ancient doom,  
 Never spoken of  
 But always known  
 If only in flashes  
 Of trembling fear.  
 And he will walk  
 The world that tried to forget him.

None shall ever pass  
 Where he walks.  
 His footprints are marks of grieving.  
 The greatest mountain  
 Is sand under his feet,  
 The eldest forest  
 A single blade of grass,  
 Bent and crushed under his heel.

All shall see his   
 The shadow of his coming,  
 Feel his stride,  
 Shaking their lives apart.  
 And know that death is upon them.  
 They will scream.  
 They will curse.  
 They will beg.  
 They will run.  
 Yet all these acts, and yet more,  
 Will cease in the same moment  
 Trod under his implacable step.

When he has reached his goal,  
 A trail of blood and silence  
 Stretching behind him,  
 He will say words  
 Never spoken before or since  
 That will be etched upon his skin.  
 Then he will lie upon that spot  
 And slumber once more.  
 As the dust that falls upon him  
 Grows into hills  
 And the wrenched fields  
 Claw slowly back to life,  
 He will sleep.  
 And one day,  
 When foolish folk once again flourish,  
 Their arrogance blinding them  
 To their own mortality,  
 The demiurge will again awake.  
 And begin his journey anew."

### Bloodthirst

[![Demigod_of_Revenge](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/SHM/Demigod_of_Revenge.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Demigod%2Bof%2BRevenge)"Tell me, seer:  
 Why does our night  
 Stretch to everlasting?"

"I see a plain  
 Grass dyed red  
 Buzzing with flies  
 And scattered with remnants  
 Once housed within skin.  
 He dances amongst  
 The fleshy remnants.  
 He bathes himself  
 In gore,  
 Then licks it clean.

He laughs,  
 A bellowing, deathly din,  
 As he slices through the heavens  
 Making them bleed.  
 Yet he does more than laugh –  
 He revels.  
 The tearing of limbs  
 Is a thing of beauty to him,  
 Art writ across flesh.  
 Screams of torment  
 Are his favorite lullaby.  
 His pride beams  
 Beholding a misshapen thing  
 Of his own design  
 Gurgling its life  
 Out onto the soil.  
 Pray to always see his glare,  
 Brimming with hate  
 And the heat of bloodlust.  
 You do not want to see him smile.

Once upon a time,  
 He was alone,  
 A single soul  
 Screaming pitifully  
 In a sea of life.  
 It thrived  
 No matter how much he reaped.  
 Joy was an anathema to him,  
 Peace an obscenity.  
 Light shone upon all  
 Buffeting and blinding him.  
 He scoured the world  
 Searching for surcease,  
 The barest hint of flaw  
 In the gem,  
 As he knew there had to be.  
 He found it –  
 A tiny hole in the sky,  
 Oozing blackness.  
 He picked at it,  
 Scrabbled at it,  
 Yet even his strength  
 Could not widen it.

In his frustration,  
 He hacked at his own flesh,  
 Rending it, clawing it  
 Searching for comfort, victory  
 In his own pain.  
 Mortals shuddered at the sound  
 Of his ribs spreading,  
 His organs bursting.  
 Finally, he lay on the ground,  
 Panting from his exertions,  
 When his form  
 Began to knit together  
 In strange ways even he did not fathom.  
 When all limbs were joined anew,  
 And life returned to muscles,  
 There stood now  
 Two of him,  
 Where there had only been one,  
 United in purpose  
 And hate.

Roaring with unholy joy,  
 The two tore at each other,  
 Reveling in their agonies.  
 Then those four did the same  
 Those eight the same  
 Those sixteen the same  
 Until a damned army  
 Hurtled towards the sky.  
 They tore wide the hole  
 And chortled at the darkness  
 Now gushing forth.  
 The hole grew wider  
 A swallowing mouth  
 That consumed the sky  
 And all its light.  
 That, my dear,  
 Is why we live in darkness,  
 And why we  
 Live in fear  
 Of what lies within it."

### Hope

[![Oversoul_of_Dusk](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/SHM/Oversoul_of_Dusk.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Oversoul%2Bof%2BDusk)  
 "Tell me, seer:  
 With the gloom all about us.  
 Why do elves still hope?"

"I see a sun,  
 A great sphere of light  
 Brighter still than the moon,  
 Warming.  
 Yet it sleeps.  
 Does it fear the depravity  
 That it would behold  
 Were it awake?  
 Is it bewitched?  
 Or is it merely ignorant  
 Of the suffering it causes  
 From its slumber?  
 Whatever the truth,  
 It has its worshippers.  
 It has its protectors.

She always runs.  
 There is always somewhere  
 She must be  
 With great haste.  
 She is all that mortals desire,  
 But do not deserve:  
 Patron,  
 Protector,  
 Mother.  
 She blinds herself  
 With a cloth  
 Over her eyes  
 For she does not wish  
 To give herself  
 The gift of sight  
 Until all the world  
 Has something they wish to see.  
 She holds a shield  
 Not to guard herself  
 But that which she holds dear.  
 She holds a spear  
 Not to slay foes  
 But to warn them  
 Before they draw near,  
 And thus  
 Avoid bloodshed.  
 She is a living bastion,  
 A fortress that walks  
 To offer her walls  
 To those in need.

Some say  
 She hid the sun herself,  
 A desperate act  
 To save it  
 From its ultimate extinction.  
 Others claim  
 She seeks the sleeper,  
 A quest that spans  
 More generations of mortals  
 Than are capable  
 Of recording it.  
 Still other claim  
 There is no sun,  
 That she deceives  
 Those she most loves  
 Lest they wither  
 From the despair  
 Of the truth.

Of all  
 The children of Shadowmoor,  
 The elves are her favorite.  
 Their dawnglove  
 Is marked  
 With the barest hint  
 Of her touch.  
 The glowmoths  
 Are her tears  
 Fluttering on the wind.  
 As long as she runs,  
 As long as she fights,  
 The elves  
 Will always hope  
 Even in the midst  
 Of crushing night.  
 But should they ever  
 Forget her  
 Or should she ever fall,  
 Some say  
 It will not only  
 Be the doom of the elves  
 But the doom  
 Of us all."

### Warfare

[![Nobilis_of_War](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/EVE/Nobilis_of_War.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nobilis%2Bof%2BWar)"Tell me, seer:  
 Why must there be war?"

"I see a great chariot,  
 Hear the snap of the whip  
 As its flame  
 Arcs against the sky  
 Like a bloody smile,  
 The snorting of the rams,  
 Their heated breath  
 Scorching the ground.  
 Its driver,  
 Its master,  
 Sees the world  
 From behind the pommel  
 Of an upraised sword.  
 His enemies are legion,  
 For they ever shift  
 With the content of his troops.  
 He knows no loyalty  
 Except to himself  
 And those he claims  
 To know –  
 The better to find  
 A willing army.

Many peoples  
 Know him  
 By many names.  
 Yet the myths are the same:  
 His great coming,  
 Ablaze,  
 Shining in his godhood;  
 The speeches,  
 The rallies,  
 His sugared tongue  
 Setting torch to the kindling  
 Of prejudice and fear;  
 The great war  
 Led under his crimson standard,  
 That scythes down  
 All that once  
 Stood tall  
 And proud;  
 The aftermath  
 Of wailing and pain  
 In which he  
 Never figures  
 At all.

He is a smith of war.  
 He stokes fervor  
 From glowing ember  
 To white flame,  
 Hammers hot  
 And pliable minds,  
 Forges soldiers  
 Out of the rough dross  
 Of peaceful life.  
 His conqueror's voice  
 Never meets silence.  
 It is answered  
 With shouts of rage,  
 Roars of approval,  
 A deadly din  
 That lifts his spirit.

You see, blood is his wine,  
 The clash of swords his song.  
 He does more than revel in it:  
 He feeds off it.  
 A great siege  
 Is a banquet to him,  
 A long and terrible battle  
 The most exquisite delicacy.  
 Each life crushed  
 Under the heel of war  
 Is a grape,  
 Its sweet juice  
 Trickling down  
 His throat.  
 He cares not  
 For the lands he conquers,  
 Nor the ones  
 Left burning and fallow.  
 He always knows  
 There is another land,  
 Another army,  
 Over the bloodstained horizon.

Without warfare,  
 Without all its aspects –  
 The fervor,  
 The pride,  
 The sacrifice,  
 The bloodshed –  
 He would cease to exist.  
 And that, my dear,  
 Is why we cannot even imagine  
 A world without war.  
 He won't let us."

### Discord

[![Dominus_of_Fealty](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/EVE/Dominus_of_Fealty.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dominus%2Bof%2BFealty)"Tell me, seer:  
 Why can some not act  
 As one mind, one soul  
 As we kithkin do?"

"I see a scepter,  
 That has met many a brow  
 In a ringing impact.  
 The hand that holds it  
 So tightly  
 Wields it  
 With careless.  
 Yet oh so careful,  
 Abandon.  
 His eyes  
 See only  
 What other eyes value:  
 Lucky coin,  
 Trusted sword,  
 Firstborn.  
 To him,  
 Nothing has worth  
 Unless it belongs  
 To someone else.  
 It is not the lust for wealth  
 That drives him  
 Simply the hunter's thrill,  
 And the moment  
 Of acquisition.  
 Nothing is truly your own.  
 It is his –   
 Whether you know it or not.

The scepter is a relic  
 Of a famed victim.  
 Once there was a king.  
 Whether of elves, kith, boggart,  
 Or something else entirely  
 Only the dead can say.  
 He had gold, jewels, silks,  
 All the riches of the world  
 At his command.  
 Until the day  
 The demigod came,  
 His power  
 Wafting off his skin  
 Like heat.  
 Struck with fear,  
 The king asked  
 What the demigod wanted.  
 The reply:  
 'Simply the most precious thing you own.  
 If I get it,  
 I will spare the rest of your wealth.  
 Will you give it willingly?'  
 The king pondered.  
 Was it his diamond,  
 As clear as a child's eyes?  
 Or his tapestry,  
 Woven from the rarest cloths?  
 Whatever it was,   
 Surely losing it was better  
 Than losing the rest.  
 The king agreed.  
 In the next moment,  
 His soul was sucked from his body  
 Into his scepter.  
 As the king fell dead,  
 The demigod took the scepter,  
 Its former owner's soul  
 Still screaming within,  
 And left.  
 The two keep counsel  
 To this day.

Do you see, my dear?  
 With such a threat,  
 Clutching hands  
 Grow tighter,  
 Suspicious eyes  
 Narrow,  
 Scheming minds  
 Inflame.  
 When those who have  
 Must constantly defend  
 Against not only those who have not,  
 But a demigod,  
 How can they unite  
 Against a more serious threat?  
 They cannot.  
 They can only die."

### Claw

[![Deity_of_Scars](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/EVE/Deity_of_Scars.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Deity%2Bof%2BScars)"Tell me, seer:  
 Why do we desire  
 To keep on living  
 Even if that life  
 Is empty and hopeless?"

"I see a great wolf  
 Fur black as a soul,  
 Fangs broken  
 By bone and steel.  
 It is an old beast,  
 Slashed by many winters,  
 Challenged,  
 Harried,  
 Beaten.  
 It enters life's twilight  
 Crossed with puffed scars.  
 This battle,  
 Fought since the day  
 Of its birth,  
 Is nearing its end.

It howled  
 To the skies,  
 Screaming injustice.  
 Why, it demanded  
 To the powers beyond,  
 Must it give up its life,  
 A life that still blazed  
 Hot within its fur,  
 The outcome preordained?  
 Why must this struggle,  
 Its greatest struggle,  
 Be futile?  
 Why, it snarled,  
 Could it not have a *chance*?

What powers, great and terrible,  
 Heard it then?  
 What powers, light or dark,  
 Granted its wish,  
 Changed it,  
 Made it into the demiurge  
 That now stalks the land?  
 Not even I know that, my dear,  
 And it is better for me that way.

The Deity  
 Is no longer that wolf  
 In flesh,  
 But in heart...  
 That is a different story.  
 His hands  
 Crush tree trunks  
 With the slightest squeeze.  
 His voice  
 Shatters ears,  
 Brings knees to soil,  
 And summons a pack  
 Far mightier  
 Than ever he commanded  
 As an alpha.  
 His skin  
 Cuts swords,  
 And a single swing  
 Of his axe  
 Hews the legs of giants  
 In twain.  
 Yet in his deepest heart,  
 Where it pulses night after night,  
 Is fear.

He became what he is  
 To survive.  
 How long will that gift last?  
 Who may come  
 Mighty enough  
 To slay him?  
 Every challenger  
 No matter how slight  
 Is a deadly threat.  
 Every battle,  
 No matter what the stakes,  
 Is raw,  
 Desperate,  
 Strewn with gore,  
 And tainted with panic.  
 Thus is he  
 The fang and bloody claw  
 Of nature  
 The primal, savage urge  
 To survive  
 No matter what the cost,  
 No matter what the casualty.  
 And this urge  
 Infects us all today.  
 Do you fear the night, my dear?  
 Perhaps you should  
 Fear him more.  
 As he fears you."

### Dominion

[![Godhead_of_Awe](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/SHM/Godhead_of_Awe.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Godhead%2Bof%2BAwe)"Tell me, seer:  
 Why does the moon  
 Wax and wane?"

"I see a single eye  
 Unblinking,  
 A wet, iridescent orb  
 That cuts through untruth  
 And self deception.  
 It humbles the mighty,  
 Brings titans to their knees,  
 Quails the dead  
 And shudders spirits  
 To their nonexistent bones.  
 The eye is in the center of a great face,  
 Implacable,  
 Expressionless.  
 Her lips curl  
 In something like loathing.  
 Her blade gleams  
 With an arrogant light  
 A pinprick of brightness  
 In the gloom of Shadowmoor.

Every sin  
 She sees.  
 Every scheme  
 She knows.  
 Every kept thought,  
 Every shameful secret,  
 Every dark desire  
 That we struggle to lock  
 So deep in our souls  
 That we refuse to say it exists...  
 She hears.  
 How does she regard us?  
 This watcher above?  
 Disdain?  
 Amusement?  
 Confusion?  
 Curiosity?  
 It is impossible  
 For one so great  
 To truly understand  
 The ways of mortals.  
 Can a kithkin  
 Who lives amongst his own kind  
 Truly know  
 The thoughts of the raven  
 Or the dreams  
 Of the wolf?

It took eons of time,  
 Unfathomable  
 By mortal minds  
 For this godhead  
 To begin to open her eye.  
 What she saw  
 Crawling upon this world,  
 Repulsed her.  
 Yet she could not tear  
 Her gaze away.  
 For reasons  
 Lesser beings  
 Will never understand,  
 She continued to watch.  
 Night after night  
 The world  
 Was her looking glass,  
 The sky  
 Her window.  
 Her eye  
 Weighed upon those below  
 As if their chests  
 Were being squeezed  
 By a vise.

'We beg of you!'  
 They cried to the eye above,  
 'We cannot bear your gaze  
 Any longer!'  
 They sank to their knees,  
 Their energy gone,  
 Humbled under  
 The oppressive presence  
 Of nothing but  
 A single eye.  
 Long moments passed  
 Perhaps an eternity.  
 Slowly...  
 Ever so slowly...  
 The eye began to shut.  
 The weight lifted  
 If only for a moment,  
 The mortals rejoiced.

And that, my dear,  
 Is why the moon changes.  
 It is the eye of the godhead,  
 Giving respite  
 From her judgment,  
 But only for a while,  
 For the impulses  
 Of such a being  
 Cannot long be denied."

### Decay

[![Ghastlord_of_Fugue](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/SHM/Ghastlord_of_Fugue.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ghastlord%2Bof%2BFugue)"Tell me, seer:  
 What lies  
 Beyond death?"

"I see cold mist  
 Plucking at skin  
 And stabbing bone  
 With chill.  
 I see eyes,  
 Pits of gloom,  
 That draw in  
 The horrified gaze.  
 He takes not a breath,  
 And his every gesture  
 Crackles like ancient bones  
 Snapping under an iron boot.  
 His claws  
 Have caressed eyes,  
 Tongues, and veins,  
 All with loving care.

He is a ghost  
 That has never known life.  
 He passes through stone  
 As if it were water,  
 Flesh and soul  
 As if they were a baby's sigh.  
 He knows the true name  
 Of every being that is  
 Or ever will be,  
 And he hates them all.  
 Is it the warmth  
 Of blood and breath  
 That he despises so?  
 Or does he believe  
 That his bitter not-life  
 Is perfection itself?

The mists  
 That blanket our world  
 Are his eyes,  
 His fingers.  
 They probe, they search,  
 They seek  
 Souls.  
 Dying souls  
 Souls that are weak  
 From age or youth,  
 Corruption or naïveté,  
 Despair or hope.  
 In the dead of their dreams  
 He finds them.  
 He tells them their true name,  
 And oh so gently  
 Holds them  
 In his chill embrace.  
 'Child,' he whispers,  
 'Let me relieve  
 All your burdens.'

Those who awaken  
 Are indelibly marked:  
 The lidded eyes,  
 The wandering mind,  
 The little jump  
 At the innocent touch.  
 They remember naught  
 But a shudder in their belly  
 And an ill-formed blot  
 In their thoughts.  
 He visits again  
 His icy hand  
 Sinking deeper  
 Drawing no blood –  
 Only cries and sobs  
 Muffled as though  
 Smothered under a pillow.  
 Each slumbereve,   
 He comes,  
 His words harsher,  
 His cut deeper,  
 Until he tears at entrail and sinew,  
 Sucks at marrow,  
 And plucks at the mouth,  
 Tooth by tooth.

Yet when his favored  
 Are found in their beds,  
 Their bodies are whole,  
 Their skin pure,  
 Except for the horror  
 Stamped forever on their faces.  
 Now, my dear,  
 That you know how one can die  
 Do you really wish to know  
 What comes after?"

I did not.

### Omens

[![Divinity_of_Pride](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/EVE/Divinity_of_Pride.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Divinity%2Bof%2BPride)"I have asked many questions,"  
 I said.  
 "But my first still remains:  
 How will this world end?"  
 The seer smiled  
 That white smile.  
 "I can tell you that, my dear.  
 In fact,  
 I will tell you  
 So much more."

And her skin   
 Fell away.

Her wings,  
 Shimmering black,  
 Cast shadows across my eyes.  
 Her gown  
 Danced like leaves  
 Awash with wind.  
 Her haughty gaze  
 Struck me to my knees.  
 "Long have I waited  
 To impart my gifts  
 To one so curious,  
 So worthy."

"Please," I begged,  
 "Leave me be.  
 I thank you  
 For your praise,  
 But I cannot accept  
 Such wonder!"  
 I tried to run  
 But my palsied legs  
 Would not even twitch.  
 "Ah," she said,  
 "But you must.  
 All is preordained.  
 It all must pass  
 As I have seen,  
 Lest you rouse my anger."  
 I squeaked.

"Now, my dear,  
 I shall reveal all.  
 The end of your world.  
 The purpose of your existence,  
 All the greatness and horror  
 Of all creation  
 Will be yours  
 Forevermore."  
 She spoke of mystery and portent,  
 Of occult and whispers,  
 Of such unfathomable things  
 That my mind  
 Screamed  
 For pity.  
 It did not come.

Even now, I try to forget.  
 But I remember.  
 I remember!  
 And I must  
 Must  
 Must  
 Must  
 Spread her word  
 Spread her truth  
 Or she shall impart  
 Even more upon me.  
 Infinity  
 Laid open  
 To me.  
 Too much  
 Much  
 Much!  
 If you could see  
 What lurks  
 Beyond the moonlight  
 You would  
 Must  
 Die!  
 I beg of you  
 Those who read these words  
 Think as I think  
 Dream as I have dreamed.  
 You must understand  
 Must understand  
 Must join me  
 Join her.

It burns  
 My brain  
 Oh heavens  
 How it burns.
