Magic Online Born of the Gods Prerelease and Release Events
===========================================================



 Posted in **Magic Online**
 on February 10, 2014 










We are only days away from *Born of the Gods!* We want to make sure that you have all the information you need so you're ready to Awaken the Myth for yourself when the Prerelease events begin on February 14.


Read on and prepare yourself for the next chapter in the *Theros*  Block.




Awaken the Myth!
The god-realm of Nyx has been flung into chaos as Xenagos claims the mantle of the god of revelry, and his ascension sends ripples across the mortal realm!


Prerelease events begin on Friday, February 14, at 10:00 AM PST (18:00 UTC), and will run through the weekend. Prerelease events will conclude and *Born of the Gods*  Release Events will begin on Monday, February 17, at 10:00 AM (18:00 UTC). At that time, *Born of the Gods*  will go on sale in the Magic Online store.


In *Born of the Gods,* players will continue their heroic path by choosing their Destiny. [A Destiny entry object](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014#prerelease) can be purchased from the Magic Online store for $5.00 starting Wednesday, February 12, following downtime. These will grant access to Prerelease Events.


![Nyxborn Shieldmate](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/img_shieldmate.jpg)
We continue to optimize **Magic Online**  events based on player feedback and trends we observe in player activity. We have restructured *Born of the Gods* [16-Player Sealed Release Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014#rel16sealed), greatly increasing the number of booster packs awarded (an additional 30 booster packs per event as compared to *Theros*). To make this possible, we increased the entry requirement by six Event Tickets per player to 26 Event Tickets.


In addition to the normal draft offerings, we're adding two *Born of the Gods*-only Draft Events to the event roster: [8-4 Single-Elimination Drafts](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014#relbngonly84) and [Swiss Drafts](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014#relbngonlydraft).


We've also changed how Prerelease and Release avatars are acquired. Players can earn the avatars they want simply by [participating in the events that award them](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014#avatars). Collect only the ones you want, or collect them all.


With our Release Events, we are starting the 64-Player Drafts two days earlier than we did with *Theros*. They begin following the downtime on Wednesday, February 19. On weekends beginning February 21, we will host the Top 8 [Release Sealed Premier Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014#relsealedprem), as well.


Happy Playing!
