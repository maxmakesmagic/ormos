Arena Open Returns with *Strixhaven* Sealed
===========================================


You enjoyed the *Kaldheim* Sealed Arena Open in February, so we're bringing it back! May 8–9, play Sealed format matches with *Strixhaven: School of Mages*.


On Day 1, get sleeves in either—or both—competitions:


* **Best-of-One**: Pick up the Rowan sleeve just for playing; seven wins earns you the Will sleeve.
* **Best-of-Three**: Pick up the Will sleeve just for playing; four wins earns you the Rowan sleeve.

Of course, you can also earn gems for wins. Rack up seven wins on Day 1, and you're invited to Day 2 where the rewards get really big—up to $2,000 big!


Find all the details on [how to play in the *Strixhaven* Sealed Arena Open](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/may-2021-arena-open-strixhaven-sealed-2021-04-22).


Bring Your School Supplies for the College Cup
==============================================


Gear up to earn points for your college in the College Cup, coming to *MTG Arena* May 13. You'll challenge students from other Strixhaven colleges, and college pride counts! Have these essential supplies to maximize your point-scoring potential:


* **College sleeves**: If you haven't completed it, [take the Strixhaven Quiz](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/strixhaven) to get your acceptance letter, which includes a code that grants you your college sleeves. Enter this code at [myaccounts.wizards.com](https://myaccounts.wizards.com/) or in the Store tab in *Magic: The Gathering Arena* on PC or Mac.
* **College avatar**: Each college's avatar is available in the second position in the *Strixhaven* Mastery web.
