If you stopped by the [*Morningtide* Minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/morningtide/home) yesterday, you might have enjoyed Mark Gottlieb's *Morningtide*-themed crossword. If you did, you got to see a preview of Door of Destinies:

That looks pretty cool. But Door of Destinies is also going to be the [*Morningtide* prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases) promo card, which means you can pick one up this weekend simply by playing in the event. So we need to promo-ify that thing up several notches. Click on our patented Promocorder, to increase the promo count exponentially.
