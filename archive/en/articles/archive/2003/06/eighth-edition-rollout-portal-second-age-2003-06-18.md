Â 
*Players voted to use this art on [Angel of Mercy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Mercy) as opposed to the* Invasion *art.*


### *[Portal Second Age](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/starter/portal/welcome.asp)* Information:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Released:** June 1998**Design Team:** Bill Rose (lead), Dan Cervelli, Joel Mick with contributions from Mike Elliott, Mark Rosewater**Development Team:** Bill Rose (lead), Dan Cervelli, Joel Mick with contributions from Mike Elliott, William Jockusch, Bill Rose, Mark Rosewater, Henry Stern, Jonathon Tweet**Art Director:** Chaz Elliott |  | **New Mechanics:** none. Like the first *Portal, Portal Second Age* simplified the games as much as possible.**Factoid:** *Portal Second Age* attempted to fix many of the "compatibility" problems of the original *Portal*. For example, *Portal Second Age*  had creature types and used the word "block" as opposed to "intercept." |
