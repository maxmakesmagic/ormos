These players both had made it to the Top 8 of a Pro Tour in the 2013–2014 season, but while Andrea Mengucci's Top 8 at Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* was his first major finish, for Guillaume Wafo-Tapa at Pro Tour *Theros* it had been his fifth. Appropriately enough, Mengucci was only just beginning the journey of his pro career whereas Wafo-Tapa had accumulated 37 Pro Points in the season this far, enough for Gold and with the option to finish the season on Platinum. Unfortunately, Wafo-Tapa as well as Mengucci had already taken one loss and could only afford one more. Unnecessary to say, neither one wanted to lose this match.


Mengucci had built a green-black deck starring [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant), with quite a bit of deathtouch in [Baleful Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Eidolon) and [Archetype of Finality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype+of+Finality) and a surprising amount of reach with several copies of [Servant of Tymaret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+Tymaret). Wafo-Tapa's green-white deck included cards of greatly varying power levels. There were some fillers in it like [Great Hart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Hart) but also absurd bombs like [Hydra Broodmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydra+Broodmaster), [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), and [Silent Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Sentinel).


Game 1


Mengucci brought quick beats with [Swordwise Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swordwise+Centaur), [Leafcrown Dryad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad), and [Cast into Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cast+into+Darkness). Wafo-Tapa tried to stall the board with [Snake of the Golden Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+of+the+Golden+Grove), but was forced to trade away his 7/7 when Mengucci bestowed [Baleful Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Eidolon). Wafo-Tapa's [Nessian Game Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Game+Warden) eventually did stop the bleeding, but not indefinitely. Mengucci made further inroads with [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant), [Servant of Tymaret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+Tymaret), and finally [Archetype of Finality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype+of+Finality).

Wafo-Tapa put [Silent Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Sentinel) and [Hydra Broodmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydra+Broodmaster) against the onslaught, finally stabilizing except for [Servant of Tymaret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+Tymaret)'s inspired ability. Wafo-Tapa, at 6 life, was under the gun, but he certainly had the tools available to turn this game around. He pumped nine mana into [Hydra Broodmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydra+Broodmaster), then seven into [Ajani's Presence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Presence). When the smoke had cleared between the clashing—now somewhat smaller—armies, the game soon turned into a race between Wafo-Tapa's [Silent Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Sentinel) and Mengucci's [Servant of Tymaret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+Tymaret).



In a complete turnaround, it was now Mengucci who needed to pick up the pace of his offense. He tried his best but died not much later to Wafo-Tapa's alpha strike.


Guillaume Wafo-Tapa 1-0 Andrea Mengucci


Game 2


Mengucci's [Servant of Tymaret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+Tymaret) again played a crucial role in the second game where it was joined by none other than another [Servant of Tymaret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+Tymaret). The pair of them didn't deal any actual damage to Wafo-Tapa (well, maybe a couple of points) but draining 2 life per turn, starting on turn five, put serious pressure on Wafo-Tapa. Thanks to [Archetype of Finality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype+of+Finality) Wafo-Tapa


Finally, [Archetype of Finality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype+of+Finality) sealed the deal for Mengucci.

Game 3



For a drastic change in pace, this time it was Wafo-Tapa who took an early lead in the damage race with his turn-two [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion). Moreover, he continued with [Burnished Hart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burnished+Hart) to cast a turn-five [Hydra Broodmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydra+Broodmaster).


Meanwhile, Mengucci's deck was misbehaving quite severely, withholding Forests, and he could only watch Wafo-Tapa's deck on its best behavior.
