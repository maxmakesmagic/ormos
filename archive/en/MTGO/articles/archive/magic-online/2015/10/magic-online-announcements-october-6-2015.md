**League Rotation Reminder**


The previous Standard League closed on Monday, October 5 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time, so players are no longer able to begin courses in that League. Players have until the Wednesday, October 7 downtime to finish their current League course in the existing Standard League. Make sure you finish your course by then, so you get all prizes you're eligible for!


After the Wednesday, October 7 downtime, Standard will have rotated and we’ll have a new Standard League available and ready to join. Again, that League will be post-rotation, and it will accept new entries until November 16 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.


If you missed it when it first became available in the client, a Modern League began on Wednesday, September 30! The Modern League will accept new entrants until Monday, November 9 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time (UTC -7).


Read the full article [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/september-2015-event-changes-2015-09-28) for more details about Leagues and other recent *Magic Online* event updates.

***Battle for Zendikar* Known Issues**


 


* [Kiora, Master of the Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+Master+of+the+Depths)’s second loyalty ability does not properly put all cards into the player’s Revealed Cards area.
* When a card with the devoid ability is given a color (perhaps by a [Painter’s Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%E2%80%99s+Servant)), it appears with distorted art.
* Converge cards do not indicate how many colors of mana were spent to cast the spell.
* Cards put into the graveyard with [Kiora, Master of the Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+Master+of+the+Depths)’s second loyalty ability do not properly trigger the second ability of [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant).
* The prompt box displays the incorrect color during the “scry-like” step in the new mulligan process.
* Several *Battle for Zendikar* promo cards appear with the incorrect set symbol.
* [Oblivion Sower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Sower)’s triggered ability incorrectly allows a player to select an face down exiled land card.
* When [Chasm Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chasm+Guide)’s triggered ability is triggered by [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar), it will appear with incorrect art on the stack.
* Cards that are exiled by [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) incorrectly show association arrows while in the Exiled Zone.
* In the Collection scene, the filter for the *From the Vault: Angels* set appears out of place (above *Battle for Zendikar* instead of with the other *From the Vault* sets).
* When [Entreat the Angels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) is on the stack with 0 chosen for X, the blue text that typically indicates the value of X does not appear.
* The Ingest keyword ability displays extraneous text in the game log when resolving.
* The landfall ability of [Emeria Shepherd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Shepherd) is not optional.

**Build Notes**


***Magic Online* October 7, 2015 Updates**


* The new mulligan rule is now live on *Magic Online*! This rule change, which allows players to scry 1 after keeping an opening hand with fewer than seven cards, impacts all formats on *Magic Online*. For more information on this new rule please read [this article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/new-mulligan-rule-starting-battle-zendikar-prereleases-2015-08-20) by Aaron Forsythe.
* A change to the way blockers are declared: If a player submits an illegal set of blockers, the game will no longer wipe away all blocking decisions. An error message will inform the player of the illegal block, but the player is no longer required to re-enter all of the blocking decisions. An additional button labeled “Reset Blockers” has been added to the prompt box if the player wants to use that function.

**Game Play**


* Duel Scene | When a player is choosing from among cards in exile, cards exiled with an association to a card on the battlefield (such as [Stasis Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Snare) or [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring)) are now properly highlighted.
* Cardset | The appearance of targeting comments has been improved. Alli Medwin’s article on the *Battle for Zendikar* release will go into more detail. Please check [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-products-game-info) during the week of October 13 to read it.
* Cardset | [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) now correctly affects all creature tokens that share a name, even if those tokens were created by different sources.
* Cardset | [Demonic Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Pact) now clearly identifies the modes already used while on the battlefield.
* Cardset| [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster)’s -7 ability no longer restarts the game when [Exquisite Firecraft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exquisite+Firecraft) is the only instant or sorcery exiled this way.
* Cardset | [Pyromancer's Goggles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Goggles) no longer incorrectly creates multiple copies of a spell.
* Cardset | [The Great Aurora](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Great+Aurora) no longer incorrectly allows tokens shuffled into a player's library to be drawn later in resolving the spell.
* Duel Scene | [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) no longer allows the player to sacrifice permanents other than Forests or Plains when activating its ability.

**General**


* Leagues | The default sort order for Leagues standings is now number of match wins in descending order.
* Collection | New items now automatically appear in player collections as soon as those items are received. Players no longer have to manually refresh to view new items.

* General | Several bugs not listed elsewhere that caused crashes have been resolved. Additionally, viewing premium cards for which the art has not yet loaded no longer causes a crash.

**Look and Feel**

* Chat | A toast messaging informing players that an opponent has started a chat no longer appears for each message sent during a match.
