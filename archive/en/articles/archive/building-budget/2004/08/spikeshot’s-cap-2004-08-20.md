Nothing beats the feeling of a [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) with a cool toy. I can remember countless limited games that were won simply on the power of [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) and [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter).


Today's article takes this idea that extra step by using a new card from *Fifth Dawn* that has been getting lots of exposure: [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating). This particular headgear can turn an innocent little [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) into a firebreathing monster. Just imagine how big that guy could get….5/2? 8/2? Even 10/2? Needless to say, shooting your opponent with one of these is likely to end the game in a hurry.


This deck idea was inspired by an email I got from a fan, John White. It just goes to show that I look at all your emails (even though I only am able to respond sometimes).

> I've been playing a deck (albeit not complete yet on MTGO) that I have had quite a bit of success with. It's a *Mirrodin* Block deck, but puts up quite a fight in Standard, and I think your readers might be interested to see it. The total cost should be next to nothing, as all the cards in the deck and sideboard are commons. (6-8 Tix @ 10 commons for 1 Tix)

In that case, it usually needs a sideboard, though, as there is no good way of getting rid of a Ravager short of [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) or [Echoing Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Ruin). It's usually a quick enough deck if you can keep the creatures out.

For a deck of all commons, I thought this was pretty good, and I really liked the concept of putting a [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) on a [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin). I decided to take my own crack at a deck like this and came up with the following:

This deck plays out by butting little artifact creatures in play along with artifact lands, thus increasing Affinity for [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite)s and [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer)s. It then can utilize a huge [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) (5+) on either a [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) or an [Arcbound Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger) since it has evasion. If you don't have either of those, you can just equip the Plating to an [Arcbound Worker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker) and attack, trading with their guy and keeping your Modular counter.


There is only one contradicting part about this deck: [Oxidda Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Golem). The [Oxidda Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Golem) usually wants to see lots of Mountains and not artifact lands, but in this deck, he is still important because he is a powerful artifact creature with haste, and will still probably be cast for no more than 4 mana. Having the extra artifact creature to put the Modular counters on really helps out. The other good parts about this deck are the [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter)s and the [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast)s. These are your secondary way of relieving your opponent of his life total, and while they are not [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating), they are still quite good at it.


### Tips on Playing the Deck


* ![Oxidda Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Oxidda+Golem)Play out your artifact lands first unless you have [Oxidda Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Golem) in hand.
* [Pyrite Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) is great for increasing your Affinity; you might want to cast your [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) before you blow the Spellbomb.
* [Arcbound Worker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker) is a very hard worker. He makes a great creature to block with since you can ship the counter onto your Stinger or other artifact creatures and swing in harder the next turn.
* Use those [Oxidda Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Golem)s to your advantage – haste can be a very important factor when dealing with [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating). They will never see it coming…when they tap all their guys to attack you, drop the Golem (and maybe the Plating) equip, and truck on in!
* Use [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) wisely – it is an extremely powerful burn spell. You can also pull tricks with your Modular creatures by [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast)ing and sacrificing them once blockers are declared. You can then move the Modular counter over to another creature, making it the victor in its combat.

### Adding Money to the Deck


As John said in his email, [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger) makes a great addition to this or any Red deck. Besides that, you could go with a more traditional Affinity build using [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager)s and possibly Black for [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) and the instant ability to move your Plating. Another fun thing to do with this deck would be adding [Atog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) or [Vulshok War Boar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+War+Boar) (especially if your version has [Lightning Greaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves)).


As a separate idea – you can cross this deck with the old Building on a Budget deck “Gunner” for some interesting action. Using [Loxodon Warhammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer) is fun in any situation!


Until next time, make sure you got your [Jester's Cap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Jester%2527s%2BCap) on straight.
