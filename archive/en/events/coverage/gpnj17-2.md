Day 2 Coverage



What a weekend in the Meadowlands! In the last Grand Prix of the year, and the final bow of *Ixalan* Limited, all the stops were pulled. The players raced full speed through the channels to wind to the Top 8, and what a crazy, stacked Top 8 it was! In the end, pros like (1) Seth Manfield, (16) Mike Sigrist, Gerard Fabiano, and Valentin Mackl fell by the wayside on Kale Thompson's route to the top. The 2017 Canadian National champion, now Grand Prix champion, and a connoisseur of a good Dinosaur Stampede. He used it to take down Sigrist in the semifinals, before beating out Seth "The Once and Future #1" Manfield in the finals.


Though *Rivals of Ixalan*will be the next time we have some good one on one Limited Grand Prix action, we won't have to leave the amazing Ixalan land of Dinosaurs, Pirates, Vampires, and Merfolk! So everybody rest up, and ready for the rivals in the new year. See you soon!

### Grand Prix New Jersey Day 1 9-0 Decklists


by Marc Calderaro




 Playing nine rounds of Magic well enough to go undefeated is one thing, but even just making sure you Sealed pool is build correctly can sometimes be even harder! Here are the four decks from Day...](/en/events/coverage/gpnj-2/grand-prix-new-jersey-day-1-9-0-decklists-2017-12-17)





Day 1 Coverage



We're closing in on the last day of 2017 Grand Prix—the first nine rounds of Grand Prix New Jersey have come to a close. With 1,135 players battling, the day ended with four players on perfect records:Eric Severson, (16) Mike Sigrist, David Schnayer, and Malcolm Kim. This was a deja vu moment for Severson and Sigrist as two years ago, they had identical records in this identical venue. While Sigrist would love to repeat his Top 8 performance from Grand Prix New York 2016, Severson hopes to reverse his past—as last time, he didn't win another match.


We've been taking a winding path through *Ixalan* Sealed today, and the route is clear tomorrow: It's time for Draft. These four may be on top now, but plenty of players are chasing them to earn their right to be in the Top 8. Join us tomorrow at [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic) for all the pirates, dinos, merfolk, and vampires you can handle! See you then.
