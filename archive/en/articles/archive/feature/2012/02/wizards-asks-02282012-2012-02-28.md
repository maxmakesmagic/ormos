**[Grand Prix Madrid](/en/events/coverage/grinning-while-youre-flinging) Top 8 Competitor Martin Juza:**

I don't need [Huntmaster of the Fells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells) or some other mythic.

![Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lingering+Souls)  
This card is so amazing, I'll take it every time. Maybe [Beguiler of Wills](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beguiler+of+Wills) is better, but my favorite definitely is [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls). Black-white is a sweet archetype, and I'm also willing to splash for it.
