Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:askwizards@wizards.com).

**Q:** What is the most reprinted nonland card in **Magic**?


—Dan H.


**A:** From **Trick Jarrett**, Editor-in-Chief for **DailyMTG.com**


This question struck my fancy as I've always been fascinated with this same thing. The answer *used* to be [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain), but it hasn't been printed since *Ninth Edition*. At that time, it had been in twenty different sets and products.


To answer this I went to Del Laugel, Head Editor for **Magic**, and her reply was [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth). According to Del, [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) has been printed twenty-three times (including its 2006 promo version, and not including its place in **Magic Online**-only sets).


  
*From the Ask Wizards archives, originally asked on Nov. 28, 2006.*


**Q**: I have been wondering why an emotion as strong as love has not been represented in any card, yet [Hatred](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hatred) gets one? Is love confusing enough to print? Also, where in the color pie would love be?

**A**: From **Brady Dommermuth**, **Magic** creative director:


I'll answer the easy part of your question first, Mauro. If you use the Greek words for various kinds of love, then *eros*, passionate love, is definitely red, and sometimes black. *Agape*, brotherly love, is white. *Philia*, fondness or appreciation, can go in just about any color, depending on its context—even loveless blue. As for why love isn't represented on cards very often... well, **Magic** is a game about spell battles, and cards tend to represent things that would have a use in such a battle. Just as there's not much use for florists or picnics in a magical battle, there's not much use for love, either. That doesn't mean we don't try to represent love when we can, though.
