 You and two friends walk into a PTQ… It is not the start of some bad joke. Rather it is my way of opening this article to let you know that the Team Limited season is getting underway. Team Limited is my all-time favorite Magic format and not just because it is the only format I have ever won money at on the Pro Tour (although it does give it quite the boost).

Wizards is trying to nudge the schedule of Pro Tours so that the seasons line up with the calendar year—in other words having Worlds close out the year in November or December as opposed to holding it in August with confusing labels like 2003-04 World Championships. In order to get that process moving along we have been graced with a second Team Limited Pro Tour—this one near the home office in Seattle—and the obligatory Qualifier season to accompany it.
