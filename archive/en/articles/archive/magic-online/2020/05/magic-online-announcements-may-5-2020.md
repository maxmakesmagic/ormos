*Magic Online* Super Qualifiers
-------------------------------


As part of our initiatives to give you [more ways to play at home](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/FNM_at_Home), we wanted to provide options for you to play at the highest levels for competitive stakes. Therefore, in light of the [changes to the tabletop Players Tour Qualifiers announced earlier](https://magic.gg/news/changes-to-qualifiers-for-players-tour-series-2-events-and-schedule), we're adding a new series of qualifiers to [*Magic Online*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/what-magic-online-magic-online-products-game-info) to provide additional ways for players to compete and qualify for upcoming Players Tour events: *Magic Online* Super Qualifiers. These online events will run alongside existing *Magic Online* Qualifiers and will continue to invite players to Players Tour Series 2 events.


And in order to make the Super Qualifiers as exciting as possible, we've added more prizes! Players who earn 65th place through 128th place will receive 100 Play Points. These prizes are in addition to those previously announced. And, because we intend this to be a quality of the Super Qualifier events as a whole, we're retroactively adding these to events that have already concluded! Players who earned these prizes will have them granted before the end of this week.


Get event info [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2020#sq), read more about MTGO Super Qualifiers [here](https://magic.gg/news/announcing-magic-online-super-qualifiers), or check out the schedule below:

CHAOS! Draft: Gravecycling Edition May 6–13
-------------------------------------------


From May 6–13, we're running Chaos Draft and throwing in a pile of sets that have a cycling theme, graveyard theme, or both. Play in a Chaos Draft with cards from *Odyssey* block, *Time Spiral* block, *Shards of Alara* block, *Innistrad* block (without *Avacyn Restored*), *Khans of Tarkir* block, *Shadows over Innistrad* block, plus *Theros Beyond Death*, and *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths*! For the first time in *Magic Online* history, the current set will be in a Chaos Draft collation. Feel the history. Draft the monsters.

Showcase Opens May 9–10
-----------------------


The penultimate events of each season, Showcase Opens allow anyone to try their hand at earning an invitation to the Showcase. Players don't need to earn points or another qualification to enter, and because these events are Sealed, players don't even need a deck. The winner of each Open will get an invitation to the Showcase, while the runner up will earn an invitation to an upcoming Players Tour Series event. Entry options include 40 Event Tickets or 400 Play Points, and events consist of Swiss pairings followed by a single-elimination Top 8 draft.


Showcase Opens are scheduled as follows:





| **DATE** | **TIME** | **FORMAT** | **INVITATION** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Saturday, May 9, 2020 | 7:00 a.m. | IKO Sealed | Season 1 Showcase, PT 2020 Series 2 |
| Sunday, May 10, 2020 | 7:00 a.m. | IKO Sealed | Season 1 Showcase, PT 2020 Series 2 |

*Ikoria* Season's Spotlight Cubes Announced!
--------------------------------------------


Now that we're closer to the events, it's time to share what's going on with the upcoming Spotlight Cube-shaped holes in our Alternative Play calendar.


In partnership with the now-postponed [CubeCon](https://mtgcubecon.com/), we're going to be running two of their cubes in consecutive weeks coming up. Gwen Dekker's *Dekkaru Cube* is going to run from May 13 to May 20, and you'll be able to read all about that cube on Friday, including a full cube list and a discussion of its major and minor archetypes. Immediately following that is John Terrill's *Cultic Cube*, running from May 20 to May 27. You'll see John's article and cube list on Monday, May 18, and it's a must-read since it goes deep into the philosophy of cube design theory in general and the creation of *Cultic Cube* in particular.


Then we've got a week for the *War of the Spark* Encore drafts. (Remember, Encore drafts aren't phantom; you'll keep everything you draft!) They're sweet, but not news.


What is news is that, starting June 3, [streamer and content creator Amaz](https://www.twitch.tv/amaz) will present his *Peasant Cube*! His article will be going up a few days before the event begins, and you can check it out then. In the meantime, you can watch Amaz stream *Magic Online* and other games on Twitch at [twitch.tv/amaz](https://www.twitch.tv/amaz).

Build Notes
-----------


* [Monstrous Step](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monstrous+Step) now interacts correctly with the menace keyword and no longer allows players to target the same creature twice.
* [Mogis's Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%27s+Marauder)'s enters-the-battlefield effect no longer causes the game to restart.
