Battle of the Planes Returns!
-----------------------------


Choose your favorite plane and defend it from the rest of the Multiverse! A perennial *Magic Online* favorite, Battle of the Planes is a fun twist on Phantom Sealed Deck play: every player's pool is seven packs, themed to the plane of their choice. Choose from wild Zendikar, spooky Innistrad, gleaming Mirrodin (before compleation!), cosmopolitan Ravnica, or Dominaria, the plane that started it all. Battle of the Planes begins tomorrow, July 17, and continues until next Wednesday.
