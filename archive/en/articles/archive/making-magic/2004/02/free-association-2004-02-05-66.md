I'm always looking for something [different](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-14) to do with [this column](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-61). Do you have any wild ideas what I should do? If I use someone's idea, I promise to give them props in the article. I'm looking for something really out there. Drop me a line. And remember, if you get your opponent to stand up five times or manage to get a card in his library (or any of the other "alternate" wins) I also want to know.
