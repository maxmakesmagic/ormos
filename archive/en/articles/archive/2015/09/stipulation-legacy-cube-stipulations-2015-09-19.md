 For the uninitiated, Stipulation Cube draft takes a traditional Cube draft and adds a layer of fun and complexity to it by assigning each drafter a rule that they must adhere to while drafting. For the Community Cup, the stipulations assigned to the two teams are listed below. Both teams share the first seven stipulations, and the eighth member of each team will have either Disaster! or Isn't It Romantic?


Here are the stipulations for this year's Stipulation Cube draft!



A-L You Need or M-Ze! – Meghan Wolff and Aaron Forsythe
=======================================================


Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into can contain only basic lands and either cards whose name begins with a letter A through L or cards whose name begins with a letter M through Z. (You can choose which, and even change which when sideboarding.)


Going AFK – Joel Larsson and Melissa DeTora
===========================================


Before the draft, choose pack 1, pack 2, or pack 3. During that pack, go help your teammates out while picks are autodrafted in that pack for you. You can draft normally in the other two packs.


Modern Mage – Adam Styborski and Sam Stoddard
=============================================


Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into must contain only Modern-legal cards.


Spellbound – Kenji Egashira and Worth Wollpert
==============================================


Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into must contain zero creature cards.


Horrible Marksman – Maria Bartholdi and Mike Turian
===================================================


Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into can't contain any cards that have the word "target" in their rules text or any Equipment or Aura cards.


Odds or Evens – Gabe Reale and Ryan Spain
=========================================


Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into can contain only land cards and either spells with an odd converted mana cost or spells with an even converted mana cost. (You can choose which, and even change which when sideboarding.)


Worldknit – Jimmy Wong and Alli Medwin
======================================


Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into must contain every card that you drafted, but you may add any number of Vivid lands and basic lands to your deck as well.


Disaster! – Anthony D'Aconto
============================


Take a card whose name sounds like the name of a disaster movie.


Isn't It Romantic? – Robert Schuster
====================================


Take a card whose name sounds like the name of a romantic comedy movie.
