--------------------



* [Format](#-tabs-1)
* [Structure](#-tabs-2)
* [Judges & Notes](#-tabs-3)

Players should review the [*Magic* Tournament Rules](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules) for the rules specific to Team Tournaments, paying particular attention to the following sections:


* Section 7.7 – Booster Draft Procedure
* Section 8.2 – Team Composition and Identification
* Section 8.3 – Team Communication

Day One: [Team Sealed Deck](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/teamsealeddeck) (12 *Ixalan* boosters)


* 20 minutes for sealed deck pool registration and deck swap
* 60 minutes for deck building
* Decklists are required
* Deck registration and deck swap will be performed for the Swiss Sealed Deck.

Day Two: [Team Sealed Deck](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/teamsealeddeck) (12 *Ixalan*boosters)


* 60 minutes for deck building
* Decklists are required

Top 4: [Team Booster Draft](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/teamdraft) (3 *Ixalan* boosters)


* Team members draft at the same draft table with one opposing team (6 total players per draft table). Team members will be seated at the draft table in exactly the following order:
	+ Team 1, Player A
	+ Team 2, Player C
	+ Team 1, Player B
	+ Team 2, Player A
	+ Team 1, Player C
	+ Team 2, Player B
* No communication (verbal or non-verbal) is permitted between team members during the draft.
* After the draft, team members will be located to separate tables to record their draft pools (15 minutes for draft pool registration and verification). After draft pool registration, team members will sit together for deck building (30 minutes for deck building).
* Each team member will play the opposing team member with the same player designation (A, B, or C).
* After the semifinals, the Top 2 teams will draft again using the procedure described above.
* Decklists are required


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 5 Swiss rounds and the Top 4 single-elimination playoff.
* All teams with an X-3-0 record (or better) or the top 40 teams – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 4 teams after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff.
* Top 4 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3 per individual match, with no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Only 1 round will be played in the semi-finals and finals.
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the playoff, the players on the team that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 4 playoff match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

Side events at a Grand Prix have a 3x Planeswalker Points multiplier (or whichever multiplier is appropriate for the event type).

**"Rebound" Event**  

Format at organizer's discretion. Players who also played in the main Grand Prix tournament will get a discount for entry.


#### Sunday


**Pro Tour Qualifier**  

The winner of the Pro Tour Qualifier receives an invitation to the same Pro Tour that the Grand Prix feeds. The format depends on the format of the Grand Prix: if the Grand Prix is Limited, the Pro Tour Qualifier will be Standard; otherwise the format of the Pro Tour Qualifier will be Limited. The Pro Tour Qualifier will consist of either an eight-round Swiss tournament with a maximum of 225 players, or eight single-elimination pods of 32 players each; in either case, a Top 8 single-elimination playoff will take place.
