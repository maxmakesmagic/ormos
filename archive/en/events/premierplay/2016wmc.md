--------------------



* [Day 1](#tabs-1)
* [Day 2](#tabs-2)
* [Playoffs](#tabs-3)

* *Kaladesh* Team Sealed Deck – 3 Swiss rounds.
* Team Unified Modern Constructed – 4 Swiss rounds.
* 12 *Kaladesh* boosters per team will be used for Team Sealed Deck.
* Standard deck lists must be submitted prior to the start of the tournament.
* The top 48 teams will advance to Day Two.


the format for Day Two is Team Unified Modern. There are no draws in Day Two. Each team will have 60 minutes to successfully complete a match. Once a team has two teammates win a match, that team wins. In the event time is called and there is no conclusion to the match yet:


* The team with the most match wins after extra turns wins the match for the round.
* In the event of a tied score between teams at 1-1, the deciding match will be determined by game count at the end of extra turns.
* In the event the deciding match's game count is tied, the player with the highest life total wins the match, which then wins that player's team the match.
* In the event the team match count, game count,andlife totals are tied at the end of extra turns, the first change in life total will result in the player whose life total is higher after said change winning the match for their team.
* In the event the game count becomes tied in extra turns, and a third game needs to be played, the match will be decided by the first change in life total, with the player whose life total is higher after said change winning the match for their team.

Day Two consists of two phases. 


**Phase 1 (4 Rounds)**


* 48 Teams compete in seeded pools (8 pools of 6 teams each).
* The first round of the day is an elimination match. The first-seed and second-seed teams in each pool will receive byes during this round. Winners advance, and losing teams are eliminated from the tournament.
* The remaining three rounds are modified double-elimination.
* The first- and fourth-highest seeds in a pool and the second- and third-highest seeds in a pool face off in the second round of Phase 1.
* The winners of the second round play each other, and the losing teams play against each other in the third round.
* Once a team wins two matches in their pool, they automatically advance to the next phase (and receive a bye for the last round of the pool). This means that the sole team in each pool that has two wins after two rounds does not play the last round of Phase 1.
* Once a team loses two matches in their pool, they are automatically eliminated from the tournament.

**Phase 2 (3 Rounds)**


* Phase 2 is modified double-elimination.
* The first- and fourth-highest seeds in a pool and the second- and third-highest seeds in a pool face off in the first round of Phase 2.
* The winners of the second round play each other, and the losing teams play against each other in the third round.
* Once a team wins two matches in their pool, they automatically advance to the next phase (and receive a bye for the last round of the pool). This means that the sole team in each pool that has two wins after two rounds does not play the last round of Phase 1.
* Once a team loses two matches in their pool, they are automatically eliminated from the tournament.


* 8 Teams compete in a seeded, single-elimination bracket.
* Teams are seeded in the bracket based on total points from Day One and Day Two.
* Playoff rounds will be Team Unified Modern Constructed.
* Teams will use the same Modern decks from Days One and Two. Different team members may play those decks than played them during Days One and Two.
