 Maryland native David Foster streamrolled his way into his first ever Grand Prix Day 2 on the back of a strong Sealed pool featuring two of the best rares in *Khans of Tarkir* Limited in [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws) and [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). Then he barreled his way into his first ever Grand Prix Top 8 after going 2-1 in both of Sunday's drafts, and was looking to continue to pile up the firsts with a win at the final table.




 In contrast to Foster's relative inexperience, Chris Fennell had five prior Grand Prix Top 8s under his belt before arriving in Baltimore, along with a Top 8 finish at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* earlier this year. After going 8-1 on Day 1, he had won his way into the Top 8 here by drafting Temur decks in both Sunday pods. Figuring it best not to mess with his recipe for success, his deck was once again based around the Blue-Red-Green wedge.




**Game 1**




 Fennell, on the draw, kept his opening hand. After a mulligan to six, Foster kept a hand featuring [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) and [Longshot Squad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longshot+Squad), along with with the four basic lands needed to cast them.




 After early jockeying for position between Fennell's two morph creatures and Foster's [Longshot Squad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longshot+Squad), a [Mardu Hateblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hateblade) came down for Foster and managed to take a tiny—but deadly—bite out of Fennell's face-down [Snowhorn Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snowhorn+Rider). After casting an [Alpine Grizzly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpine+Grizzly), Foster then decided to rustle it out of hibernation, casting [Awaken the Bear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awaken+the+Bear) to take down Fennell's second morphed copy of [Snowhorn Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snowhorn+Rider).






*Fennell's pair of morphed [Snowhorn Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snowhorn+Rider)s were no match for a bear that had been awoken*
