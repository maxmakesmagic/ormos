Quarterfinals 1: Yuki Matsumoto (White Blue Aggro) vs. Ryouta Shimizu (5-Color Green)
=====================================================================================


Ryouta Shimizu had a few keywords on his mind, mainly Domain and Sunburst. His 5-color Green deck with double [Matca Rioters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matca+Rioters) and quadruple [Skyreach Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyreach+Manta) looks to be very powerful in the late game. He does have a fair number of mana fixers, including [Wayfarer's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble), [Sylvan Bounty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Bounty), [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth), and [Sphere of the Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+the+Suns).



**Game One**




 Yuki Matsumoto did not want to give him time to summon his dangerous creatures though. He quickly deployed [Gust-Skimmer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gust-Skimmer) and a very dangerous [Mirran Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader). A timely [Vapor Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag) bought him enough time before Shimizu's [Etched Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Oracle) and [Skyreach Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyreach+Manta) could stabilize the board for him.

**Game Two**




 In the second game, Ryouta Shimizu fought back with a fourth-turn [Creakwood Liege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creakwood+Liege). Yuki Matusmoto's White Blue deck had no elegant solution to that, so they quickly moved on to the third game.

**Game Three**



Yuki Matsumoto curved out perfectly in the rubber game, leading with [Gust-Skimmer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gust-Skimmer), [Sunspear Shikari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunspear+Shikari) and [Blinding Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Souleater). Ryouta Shimizu was able to kill [Glassdust Hulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glassdust+Hulk) and [Qumulox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qumulox) with [Tribal Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribal+Flames), and [Plummet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet).


Thereafter, he was able deploy a pair of [Skyreach Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyreach+Manta) but his life total was too low. A few [Blinding Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Souleater) activations later and Yuki Matsumoto was off to the semi finals.

Quarterfinals 2: Katsuhiro Mori (White Green) vs. Ichiro Matsubara (White Green)
================================================================================



 Both decks were white and green but had vastly different approaches.




 World Champion Katsuhiro Mori has put together a "funny deck" as he claims. [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) and a pair of [Rusted Relic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rusted+Relic)s give his deck a light touch of metalcraft. He intends to support his artifact strategy with a pair of [Sunlance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunlance) and [Scatter the Seeds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds), in the hopes of overrunning his opponent quickly.

On the other hand, Ichiro Matsubara's deck had a Convoke theme. [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) and [Kozilek's Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator) are the cornerstones of his strategy, as they allowed [Kavu Primarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Primarch), [Root-Kin Ally](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Root-Kin+Ally), and [Conclave Phalanx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conclave+Phalanx) to hit the board prematurely.



**Game One**



Ichiro Matsubara opened with [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) and quickly added [Elite Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Skirmisher) and [Hikari, Twilight Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hikari%2C+Twilight+Guardian) to the board. Katsuhiro Mori stuck [Blinding Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Souleater) to the board and tried to get to the finish line by racing with a 9/2 [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk). But an opposing [Pelakka Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pelakka+Wurm) and [Conclave Phalanx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conclave+Phalanx) threw all the combat math out of the window. Katsuhiro Mori was down one game.

**Game Two** 




 Katsuhiro Mori powered out [Rusted Relic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rusted+Relic) with [Sphere of the Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+the+Suns), before switching on Metalcraft with [Runed Servitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Servitor). He stuck [Kitesail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitesail) on it and raced through the skies once more. Despite putting up a formidable ground force, Ichiro Matsubara eventually ran out of counters on his [Aquastrand Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquastrand+Spider) and folded to the 6/5 flyer.




**Game Three**




 Katsuhiro Mori demonstrated just how powerful Metalcraft can be. With the aid of [Everflowing Chalice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) and [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal), he was able to summon [Rusted Relic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rusted+Relic), [Blinding Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Souleater), [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol), and [Alloy Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alloy+Myr) all by his fifth turn. Ichiro Matsubara did not have as unfair a start and could only manage "fair" creatures such as [Elite Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Skirmisher) and [Gnarlid Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarlid+Pack) and quickly folded to the blistering start.

Quarterfinals 3: Kim Minsu (Artifacts) vs. Shougo Sunada (Black Green splash Blue)
==================================================================================


Kim Minsu's artifact based deck featured powerful cards such as [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) and [Rusted Relic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rusted+Relic) but needed a little time to attain critical mass.

 Shougo Sunada's deck was much faster though. Curving out perfectly with efficient creatures such as [Vampire Lacerator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Lacerator), [Duskhunter Bat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskhunter+Bat), and [Ghostly Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Changeling), he was quickly able to reduce his opponent to just five life. By the time Kim managed to get his [Rusted Relic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rusted+Relic) online, a timely [Mutagenic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth) ended the game there and there.

**Shougo Sunada 2 - Kim Minsu 0**



Quarterfinals 4: Albert Budisanjaya (Mono Red) vs. Junya Iyanaga (Black Green)
==============================================================================


World Champion Junya Iyanaga's Black Green deck has a very focused theme. His [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader)s and [Tukatongue Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tukatongue+Thallid)s will go very well with his [Scion of the Wild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+the+Wild)s and triple [Plagued Rusalka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plagued+Rusalka).

*Junya Iyanaga*



Albert Budisanjaya has a different approach though and has assembled a Mono-Red deck with aggressive creatures and cheap removal spells. In case that doesn't work out, he has [Nobilis of War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nobilis+of+War) and [Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Infinite+Gyre) in case he ever plays the long game.

*Albert Budisanjaya*




 Regardless, Junya Iyanaga was able to keep the red men at bay using the combination of [Plagued Rusalka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plagued+Rusalka), [Bloodthrone Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire), and [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) in both games. Now that Junya Iyanaga had gummed up the board, he took over the game with [Kavu Primarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Primarch) and [Vampire Outcasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Outcasts) in those respective games.




**Albert Budisanjaya 0 - Junya Iyanaga 2**
