The 44 players competing this weekend have three different formats that they needed to be ready for. However, as this tournament takes place during the release weekend for *Fate Reforged*, many competitors will be diving into some of these cards in a tournament for the very first time.


Sealed Draft
============


The day starts off with a unique format known as Sealed Draft. In Sealed Draft, players will open two packs of *Khans of Tarkir* and one pack of *Fate Reforged*. Players will register those cards and review the cards for three minutes. Once that time is up, players will put those cards aside. Those cards will be available to them during their deck build.


Once the “Sealed” portion of the Sealed Draft is completed, players will then partake in a booster draft of two packs of *Fate Reforged* and one pack of *Khans of Tarkir* (in that order).


Once the draft is complete, players will then combine their drafted cards with the cards they opened prior to build the best 40-card deck they can.


The Sealed Draft portion is played for three rounds.


Standard
========


The next three rounds of competition are Standard Constructed, and it's the first weekend where *Fate Reforged* cards are legal, meaning that the format is fresh with a ton of new cards added into the mix.


Of course, getting those cards for a deck on short notice, given the set just came out, could be problematic. Enter Wizards of the Coast! For this weekend, the Super Sunday Series Championship competitors were allowed to build with up to four of any card of *Fate Reforged* available to them. Once they turned in their decklists this morning, staff members then got to work pulling copies of *Fate Reforged* for the competitors to borrow this weekend, ensuring that card availability was not an issue if competitors wished to play with new cards!


Standard Constructed will last for three rounds, and will also be the format for the Top 8 playoffs.


Booster Draft
=============


Tomorrow will feature three rounds of Booster Draft, featuring the traditional format of 1 *Fate Reforged* and two *Khans of Tarkir* packs (in that order). What sorts of strategies will players explore tomorrow now that a pack of *Fate Reforged* has replaced a pack of the previous set?


Three formats, nine rounds, and plenty of *Fate Reforged* will ensure the next two days of *Magic* are a new and exciting look into what's to come!
