Wizards of the Coast

We asked a couple of players what they believe to be the three best decks in Standard at the moment. And one should value their input, seeing as these four can boast a combined four Pro Tour Top 8s as well as six Grand Prix Top 8s...


The Three Best Decks in Standard at the Moment?

***Thoralf Severin:** I'd say Abzan Midrange, Abzan Aggro, and the Sultai deck with Sidisi and [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos).*

***Matej Zatlkaj:** Abzan, Mono-Red. And Jeskai is still good too, despite all the bad press.*

***Oliver Polak-Rottmann:** Abzan Aggro, Jeskai Control, and Sultai (Sidisi/Whip).*

***Denniz Rachid:** Mardu, Abzan Aggro, and Jeskai Ascendancy Combo. That last one is greatly underrated.*
