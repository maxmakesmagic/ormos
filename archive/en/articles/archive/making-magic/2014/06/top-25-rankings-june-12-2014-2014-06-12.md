We're one week closer to the end of the season, and with no major events this past week, the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings remain unaltered. That means Reid Duke heading a phenomenal band of spellslingers from around the globe. So what's left on the event calendar, as we count down toward the final Pro Tour of the season—Pro Tour ***Magic** 2015*—in Portland in August? 

First up is an electrifying trip to Moscow this weekend, with Standard the format. With travel favoring the adventurous, this could be an opportunity for someone intrepid to steal a match from rivals, put some Pro Points in the bank, and get to see one of the world's truly great cities.

 The following weekend, Chicago hosts a Standard weekend. With O'Hare an incredibly busy airport, this is one of the easiest Grand Prix to attend on the whole season calendar. Seven days later, it's time for another double-header, with Washington DC and Milan both playing host to a weekend of *Theros* Block Limited action. After a break through much of July, players in search of points will get to choose between Boston-Worcester (Modern) or Taipei (***Magic** 2015* Limited) before Portland takes center stage. 

If that final Pro Tour began this weekend, no fewer than seventeen players could still be crowned Player of the Year. Join us next week to see if Grand Prix Moscow can change the Top 25 landscape.
