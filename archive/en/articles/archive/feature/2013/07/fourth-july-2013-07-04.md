Here in the United States the Wizards offices are closed as we celebrate the 4th of July, our independence day.


In American notation we write the date of July 4 as 7/4, which also happens to be a somewhat reasonable power/toughness. Let's see what a Gatherer search yields...

I remember casting [Ashen Monstrosity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen+Monstrosity) a few times during Kamigawa block and even before that I made good use of [Illusionary Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Wall). The most recent of these was ***Magic** 2012*'s [Crumbling Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Colossus), but sadly there isn't a 7/4 in ***Magic** 2014*.


So what if we're feeling a bit cheeky and we use international notation to instead write the date as 4/7, what other creatures do we turn up?

Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite
 | 
Guardian of Vitu-Ghazi
 |
| 
Hundroog
 | 
Jareth, Leonine Titan
 |
| 
Jhovall Queen
 | 
Luminate Primordial
 |
| 
Myr Battlesphere
 | 
Sir Shandlar of Eberyn
 |
| 
Tariel, Reckoner of Souls
 | 
Verdeloth the Ancient
 |

Well the 4/7 form is quite interesting with [Elesh Norn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elesh+Norn), [Jareth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jareth), [Luminate Primordial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Luminate+Primordial), [Tariel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tariel), and [Myr Battlesphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Battlesphere)! That's a spicy power/toughness!


Turns out the power toughness of 4 and 7 in either position yields quite a few interesting cards! Now I'm off to enjoy the day off and... wait... I have to do another Arcana for tomorrow? Back to work I guess.
