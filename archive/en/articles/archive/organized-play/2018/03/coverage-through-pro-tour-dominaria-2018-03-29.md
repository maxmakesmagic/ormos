 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 






With the first quarter of 2018 wrapping up, today we're going to look at the next two months of live video coverage that you watch on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). We've got rosters all the way through Pro Tour *Dominaria*.


Seattle Double Weekend
======================


First up is the weekend of April 6–8, as [Grand Prix Seattle](http://cfbevents.com/gpseattle/) features both Legacy and Standard main events. The big tournament action starts with Legacy on Friday, April 6. Coverage will show you the Legacy tournament in its entirety, as Standard gets underway on Saturday. Then on Sunday, coverage will turn its full attention over to Standard to show you the conclusion of that format's main event.


**Start Times**: Friday at 9 a.m. PT/12 p.m. ET/4 p.m. UTC; Saturday at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET/5 p.m. UTC; Sunday at 9 a.m. PT/12 p.m. ET/4 p.m. UTC

Special notes for Seattle's GP coverage weekend:

* *Magic*'s Play Design team will be providing live coverage this weekend alongside Reid Duke! You'll hear expert commentary from Paul Cheon, Adam Prosak, Dan Musser, and more in various rounds all throughout the three days of coverage from Seattle!

GP Hartford and Sydney
======================


Taking place the weekend of April 14–15, [Grand Prix Hartford](http://cfbevents.com/gphartford/)'s Modern event will be one last look at all formats at the GP level before *Dominaria* makes its way into the public.

Washington, DC
==============


Although we take a week off from [GP Toronto](http://cfbevents.com/gptoronto/) (with Meghan Wolff bringing you social media and written coverage), we resume the weekend of May 26–27 for a Team Limited Grand Prix in [Washington, DC](http://cfbevents.com/gpdc/), with some pre–Pro Tour coverage goodness.

DC also marks the last Grand Prix that will qualify top teams for Pro Tour 25th Anniversary. After that, the remaining trios for the Team Pro Tour will be determined by the Pro Tour Team Series, the team Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers, and those that form a trio among those who qualified as individuals. This should make the DC GP an exciting one to watch!


DC also leads into . . .
