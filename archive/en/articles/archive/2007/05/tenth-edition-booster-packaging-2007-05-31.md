You've already seen the [*Tenth Edition* theme decks](/en/node/602066) and heard about [**Magic** Game Day](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday) coming up July 14th. Today we take another step deeper into this *Tenth Edition* of the core set by looking at its booster packs.


The 10E boosters sport a cool color-coded look to them. Don't worry, they're still randomizedâ€”full of delectable five-color mysteries just like any booster pack of **Magic**. But each booster shows off the power of one of the five colors with a little extra "zing." Enjoy.

Look for these display boxes wherever fine **Magic** cards are sold, starting on [**Magic** Game Day](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday), July 14th. Tell 'em Kamahl sent you!
