 Bruce's games invariably involve several friends, crazy plays, and many laughs. Bruce believes that if anyone at your table isn't having fun, then you are doing it wrong. 






The game had been going steadily downhill for you right from the start. You couldn't seem to keep anything on the board for any length of time, and your life total had been dwindling. Amy seemed to have most of the board locked down with several permanents that continued to bounce everything back to players' hands.

 You managed to draw a [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan) and were starting to make some inroads, as Amy really didn't want to bounce the [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan). Josh played out a [Diluvian Primordial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diluvian+Primordial) and also started to break the lock. Tyler looked frustrated, but was stocking his hand with cards that would undoubtedly start hitting the table as soon as he thought he could keep them there. 

 At that point, you drew [Fated Infatuation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Infatuation) and cursed the Fates. The [Fated Infatuation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Infatuation) can give you a copy of [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan), but there was no way Amy wouldn't bounce it away. Since it would only be a token creature, when it bounces, it doesn't come back. 

 If only you had chosen the [Phyrexian Metamorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Metamorph)! All those options to copy! Instead, the [Fated Infatuation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Infatuation) offered a limited enter-the-battlefield effect, and nothing more. The Fates laugh at your impotence.
