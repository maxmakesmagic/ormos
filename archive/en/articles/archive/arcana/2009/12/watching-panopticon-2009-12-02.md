Consider the [Panopticon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panopticon). Here, we'll show you the card so you can consider it more easily.

Here's what the art for [Panopticon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panopticon) looks like, shorn of its *Planechase* trappings.

On Earth, a "panopticon" is a structure for a prison in which the guards stay at the center and can see into any cell at any time. On the plane of *Mirrodin*, it's a massive tower (occupied by [Memnarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch)) from which the entire plane can be viewed. You might know it better as the [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel).

Ah, but what about those growths that are all around the tower in the [Panopticon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panopticon) art? You can see a couple of them in the distant background of [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel), but there's a better view of them on [Mirrodin's Core](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrodin%27s+Core).
