Hello to all things that go bump in the night!


We kicked off our return to Innistrad by taking you deep into the Kessig Forest with [*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/midnight-hunt)'s Harvesttide Festival. Now it's time for the grandest wedding ever seen on Innistrad with [*Innistrad: Crimson Vow*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/innistrad-crimson-vow).


![VOW teaser artwork](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/QsEYMlzbt2.jpg)


There's a crisp chill in the air. Leaves fall from the trees. By now, you've likely whipped up a pumpkin coffee in your cauldron, gone on a nature walk through the apple orchard, lit a fire in your hearth, and howled at the moon like werewolves. We're here with one more item to add to your fall bucket list: the experience of an epic vampire wedding.


*Innistrad: Crimson Vow* is packed with everything you'd expect from a vampire wedding: a "radiant" bride and dashing groom, guests traveling from afar, and gifts to share—all being attended to with exacting detail. You can learn more about everything included in boosters with Product Architect Mike Turian's [Collecting *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/collecting-innistrad-crimson-vow-2021-10-28), and be sure to see all the delightful card frames themselves in [Clayton Kroh's Booster Fun article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/sink-your-teeth-booster-fun-innistrad-crimson-vow-2021-10-28).


Let's check out the products in store for us!


DRACULA SERIES CARDS
====================


A cozy fireside read for any gothic horror fan, Bram Stoker's *Dracula* is widely accepted as the quintessential vampire novel. Naturally, we had to invite him to the wedding ceremony, and he didn't come alone.


There are 18 total Dracula series cards in *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* inspired by beloved characters from the 1897 novel, and they can be obtained in a few different ways. 17 of these cards can be found in Collector Boosters and the single-card Box Topper boosters, while the eighteenth card is only available through our Buy-a-Box promotion.


**1. Box Topper Booster: A traditional foil Dracula series card**


The most common way to get one of these is from the single-card Box Topper booster, one of which comes packaged inside each *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* Set, Draft, and Collector Booster display. By purchasing any one of these three products, you will find one Dracula series card with a traditional foil treatment inside the Box Topper booster.

**2. Buy-a-Box WPN Promo: Castle Dracula**


The second way to get your claws on a Dracula series card is by visiting your local [WPN store](https://locator.wizards.com/). By purchasing your box of Draft, Set, or Collector Boosters at a WPN store, you can receive the Castle Dracula Buy-a-Box promo, an alternate art of Voldaren Estate, while supplies last, in addition to the Box Topper booster that comes inside the box.


![Castle Dracula](https://media.wizards.com/2021/vow/en_NhHoUQDLXh.png)


That's right, you can get two Dracula series cards by purchasing a Set, Draft, or Collector Booster display from your local WPN store while supplies last.


**3. Collector Boosters: One (or more) in every pack!**


The final way to get Dracula series cards is by opening Collector Boosters.


In every Collector Booster, you are guaranteed one non-foil Dracula series card *and* have a chance to receive an additional Dracula series card in traditional foil treatment.
