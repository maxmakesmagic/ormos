Unless you've been living under a [Barrage of Boulders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrage+of+Boulders), you know that this Standard format is one of the most diverse in a long while. Every deck type is played in one form or another; every clan is played in one form or another; and just about everything that's good, can have a deck built around it.


One of the only truisms of the format is that midrange is good. So if you aren't going to be straight midrange, a good strategy is to do one of three things: Go over, under, or around. Decks like big control, or "big midrange" (like Sidisi Whip) try to out-advantage midrange with an all-out slugfest. Decks like Boss Sligh try to go under—stealing 20 points of damage before midrange can get its shoes on. And "around" are decks that have a lot of combo potential, like White-Blue Heroic, Astronomer Ascendancy, or even [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) Tokens, that can deal oodles of damage out of nowhere, even if they get a slow start.


I talked to representatives from a couple archetypes around the Day 2 field to see what strategy people were doing—Beat them? Join them? Over, under, or around?
