![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/959.jpg)These are the kind of players that you would expect to see at 5-0 in a Grand Prix. Both are former Pro Tour champions (in Marco's case with a little help from his friend Kai Budde), and both are looking for a sixth win which will secure their place in the second day.

They are both running blue-black decks, Bob has Zombie Infestations to go with his Upheavals and Marco has [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)s.

### Game 1

Both players kept their hand and started with an Island (sadly not an uncommon beginning to games during this Grand Prix). On turn two Bob played a [Zombie Infestation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation) and discarded two [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), a [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) and an [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood). Marco cast a [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion), and then took four from Bob's Zombie army. To compound Marco's problems, Bob cast [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill). Marco cast [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood), which killed one of the Zombies but gave Bob three more cards to get replacements. After a couple of turns of Zombies attacking and Bob flashing back [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) Marco was on eight life, and the [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst) that he fetched with a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) was countered, yet another Zombie being created in the process. That was quite enough for Marco, who scooped up his cards.

Bob 1 - Marco 0

Both players tried to take out as many black removal spells as they could and bring in card drawing spells. Bob had to put [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator)s into his deck, despite the fact that they are far from great in this matchup, in order to remove the [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood)s. He also brought in a [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) and a [Flash of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash+of+Insight), which were somewhat better. Marco brought in multiple [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying)s and [Zombie Infestation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation)s, which would give him a much better chance after sideboarding. Both players agreed that Bob had a big advantage before sideboarding, and that his draw wasn't bad either.

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/960.jpg)This time it was Marco who played an Infestation on the second turn, but saw his token [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)ed before it could do any damage. Each player took it in turn to play [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), Marco's was [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic)-ed, and Bob resolved one and had another [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate)d. Marco also got a [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) into play. He also managed to cast [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) for four cards, while Bob played a [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). Marco made some Zombies, but Bob [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)ed them away. Both players then started to cycle through their decks with [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion), but Bob had five cards to Marco's three as a result of resolving more Deep Analyses and killing off the Zombies. He got a [Zombie Infestation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation) into play, more to see if Marco had any counters or not then for what it could do on its own, and then when both players had eight land, tried a [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) for five, choosing not to remove his own [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)s from the graveyard (after the game Bob reckoned this was a mistake - it was intended to make Marco feel safe about letting Bob cast [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval)). Marco couldn't let the Scrying resolve, but the ensuing counter war left him tapped out. On the next turn Bob cast [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and made six Zombies. Marco discarded two [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)s, and hoped to draw one more to enable him to Burst all the Zombies away, but instead he drew a Swamp and the Zombies got him.

Final result: Bob Maher 2, Marco Blume 0
