This round saw an all French match-up with both players on 8-2. Like a lot of other French players; Raphael was playing [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren); whereas Antoine was playing [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Theoretically this should be a good match-up for Raphael if he can find some Cabal Therapies, but otherwise it is good for Antoine.

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a929.jpg)The first play was Raphael's second turn [Wall of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Blossoms). In response Antoine [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed and used a [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) to shuffle away two [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict)s – they're almost entirely useless in the match. Antoine summoned a [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) on his third turn. Raphael played an [Eladamri's Vineyard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eladamri%27s+Vineyard) which allowed Antoine to cast [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and still have [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) mana open. Raphael split the Fact, [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) and [Memory Lapse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse), or [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and two lands. Antoine took the two card pile. He attacked with the [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) but didn't try to bust it past the [Wall of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Blossoms).

On Raphael's next turn he attempted a [Raven Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raven+Familiar) but it was countered. After Antoine cast another [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) he sat for a while doing the [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) math before [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ing for [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) and two irrelevant cards and attacking for exactly the right amount of damage.

Antoine Ruel 1 – Raphael Levy 0

Antoine sides in [Engineered Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) and [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), whereas Levy could only improve his deck by a solitary [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy)

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a928.jpg)Raphael had a first turn Vineyard this game. Antoine had to burn for two as his only play was a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), but at least the [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) got rid of [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) and left Levy with just Bird; [Cavern Harpy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+Harpy) and land. Raphael drew and cast [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) for three Cabal Therapies. The Therapy didn't take any [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)s as Raphael had hoped. Since Antoine knew Raphael was missing both [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) and [Raven Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raven+Familiar) he could afford to tap out for a [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction).

On his next turn Raphael dropped a [Wall of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Blossoms), and used it to Therapy again for [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) since Antoine had drawn one from the Fact. Levy had the fourth Therapy in his hand and took [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) as well, leaving Antoine with just Edict.

Now Raphael could drop the [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren), but he didn't have the combo. Both players spent a few turns taking mana burn from the Vineyard; until Antoine got a second Knowledge, drew into a third, which drew him into a [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). The [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) was more than lethal and Levy was only able to block it once with a Bird before succumbing. He had three Cavern Harpies in his hand.

**Final Result:** Antoine Ruel 2 – Raphael Levy 0
