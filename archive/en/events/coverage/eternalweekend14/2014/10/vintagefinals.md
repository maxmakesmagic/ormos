 This morning, 341 hopeful *Magic* players came to the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia with dreams of being crowned Vintage Champion. After nine rounds of swiss and two elimination rounds, only two remain.




 Dario Moreno traveled all the way from Madrid, Spain to compete in the Eternal Weekend events. Moreno has no previous tournament success, but he's a dedicated Vintage and Legacy player that wanted to be a part of the respective championships here in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania this weekend. Moreno is armed with a Blue/Red [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) strategy featuring [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise).




 Eternal specialist, Mark Tocco is the hometown hero. The Philadelphian has been dominating eternal events for the last few years. Tocco Top 8ed the Legacy Championship last year and he's been honing his Vintage and Legacy skills at Redcaps Corner in preparation for this event. Tocco wants to bring the Vintage Championship home to Philadelphia. Tocco is armed with a powerful [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) strategy.




 Tocco used [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) and [Sol Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring) on the play to power out [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), but Moreno had [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will). Moreno followed up with [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) and used another [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) on Tocco's [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids).
