Gabriel Nassif, holder of seven Pro Tour Top 8 finishes, among them a win, did not know what to play. Even on Thursday afternoon, he was agonizing over his list of decks to play. In the end, Nassif used Floody Friday to assemble a red-green-black aggro deck. "I have played a few games with it, and I liked it," said the pro, admitting that he hadn’t tested the deck thoroughly.


By contrast, thorough testing is a trademark of Guillaume Wafo-Tapa, creator of Dralnu du Louvre and winner of Pro Tour–Yokohama. He had taken a detour from his typical control decks for this tournament, illustrating the widespread belief that control alone is just not going to cut it in Valencia.


### Game 1


Guillaume won the die roll and led off with [Snow-Covered Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snow-Covered+Island). What exactly hid behind the foily glint of a *Coldsnap* snow [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), no one knew.


Nassif did not hold his cards close to his chest, unrolling [Bloodstained Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire) into [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) on turn one. [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), another [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) joined Nassif’s board soon after. Guillaume had just a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder).


When a couple of [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s had joined Guillaume’s board, he finally showed his allegiance: Tapping ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif), he played [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), followed by [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) and [Mind’s Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%E2%80%99s+Desire) for three. [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), another [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) and [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) revealed themselves. [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams) followed, and [Mind’s Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%E2%80%99s+Desire) stormed up to the plate again to reveal many, many cards, among them [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) and another [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze) from the sideboard ended the first game of Pro Tour–Valencia in Guillaume’s favor.

### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptval07/fm1_nassif_wafo-tapa.jpg)*Two renowned French players meet in Round 1.*Nassif was determined not to be steamrolled by the combo again. Fetchland into [Blood Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Crypt) took 3 life from him but enabled a first-turn [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), revealing [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), and [Moment’s Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%E2%80%99s+Peace) among lands.


Nassif decided to get the Peace into Guillaume’s graveyard, cracked another fetchland into an untapped *Ravnica* dual land (it just hurts) and ran out [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Holding back on the beater, he decided to use [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) to dispatch Guilalume’s toolbox of two Wishes. [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) took out the Speedbump-Tribe Elder, and a 4/5 [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) started what he does best: Beating down.


Nassif was determined not to let his advantage slip. [Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain) on [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) kept Guillaume off double blue, and an attack with [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) took Guillaume to 9. In preparation for the final punch, Nassif looked to [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). Guillaume responded with [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven), needing something, anything, to buy himself more time. [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Moment’s Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%E2%80%99s+Peace), and [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) plunked Nassif deep into thought.


With the Therapy still on the stack, Nassif gave Guillaume [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), only to immediately discard the Analysis with his Therapy. Guillaume flashed it back next turn, trading 3 life for two cards and now facing lethal damage on the board with [Moment’s Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%E2%80%99s+Peace) in his graveyard. Time, again, was all he needed, and [Moment’s Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%E2%80%99s+Peace) could provide at least a brief respite.


But other than time, mana was also at a premium for Guillaume. Nassif took out Wafo-Tapa’s only [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), forcing his fellow countryman to pay the full price for [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow) to get a replacement. Another [Moment’s Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%E2%80%99s+Peace) prevented Guillaume from dying, and Guillaume then emptied his hand for a desperate last attempt. He untapped his lands with [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest), played a zero-mana artefact, [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives), to boost the storm count, and tapped out for [Mind’s Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%E2%80%99s+Desire). The first flip revealed [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven), over which Guillaume agonized before deciding that, yes, he wanted to get [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven), [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), and Revive out of his library.


With no cards in his hand, and no mana left untapped, there were still two flips to go. An [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) from the top would give him at least mana to play the Revive and [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) that Nassif had given him, but the two players smiled when Guillaume revealed nothing relevant and went on to Game 3.


Wafo-Tapa 1, Nassif 1


### Game 3


Already, the feature match area was lined with spectators (among them 2006 Rookie of the Year Sebastian Thaler, who indicated that he had won his first match). In a format as fast as Extended, we expect to see many pros among the spectators, since quite a few of them should be done with their rounds with time to spare.


 



![Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Heartbeat+of+Spring)

Nassif kicked off Game 3 with a mulligan on the draw, and was happy to reveal a [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void) in his starting hand. His [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) was hit by a [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), just like [Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain) a turn after. Guillaume was buying himself the quintessential commodity, time, but Nassif was set up well to deny him just that. [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) on the second try, [Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium), then [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Guillaume clearly loved his [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)s, as the third one in this game delayed the [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) for nary a turn. Nassif just played [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb) and took [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) out of Guillaume’s hand (leaving [Mind’s Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%E2%80%99s+Desire), [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and 2 [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis)), destroyed an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) with [Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain) and passed the turn.


Up to this point, Nassif was already down to 14 life from his own painlands and fetchlands. As [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) was ready to start equalizing the score, and Nassif opened a barrage of two [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer)s, Guillaume had a timely [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). EOTFOFYL, right? Not quite, but Nassif was facing a pile of [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest), [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). With [Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium) on his side, Heartbeat shouldn’t have worried him much, especially since Wafo-Tapa was stuck on three [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and one [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island).


Nevertheless, it was painfully apparent by just looking at the board that Nassif had to invest much more energy into a win here than Wafo-Tapa, who’d just waltz through the combo once he reached breaking point. Nassif split Heartbeat and [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) against the rest, and Guillaume took the mana pile with a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) as added bonus—for now.


Nassif’s Confidant revealed [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) and took him to 8. Guillaume was on 17 with seven lands in play, a comfortable position to be in; enough mana to go off and a solid chunk of life between him and death. And Nassif knew he had to get Guillaume before long or die.


[Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) promised to be a turbo boost for the damage race. Guillaume, though, grabbed [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) with his end-of-turn [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), reckoning that Nassif just couldn’t kill him in time despite having a full board. Wafo-Tapa was at 13 from Lavamancer activations, and Nassif counted up his potential damage. Seeking to finish the match now, he put everything but his [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) in the red zone. Guillaume calmly tapped three for [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest), made a lot of mana, played a second [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest), fetched Hunting Pack with a second [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), and put four 4/4 blockers in the way of the two Lavamancers and the [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Nassif cracked his [Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium) and killed his Leyline to get cards in his graveyard, but still couldn’t save the [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Nassif was left with just a [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) and a [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) against two 4/4 beasts—further resistance proved futile.
