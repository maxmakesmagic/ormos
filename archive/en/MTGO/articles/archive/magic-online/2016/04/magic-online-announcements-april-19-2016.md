**Reminder: No Downtime on April 20**


In an effort to make sure *Magic Online* is available when you want to play *Magic*, we're working on ways to reduce the number of times we have to bring the system offline for maintenance. As a first step we're simply going to eliminate at least one downtime each month.


Here are the dates of the exact downtimes we'll be skipping in the first half of 2016:


* April 20
* May 11
* June 8
* June 22

During these weeks without a downtime, *Magic Online* will NOT be processing set redemptions. **This means that if your order wasn't made prior to the April 13 downtime, it won't be processed until April 27.**

**Upcoming Extended Downtime on Wednesday, April 27**


There will be an extended downtime on Wednesday, April 27, for *Magic Online*. Events close at 12:00 a.m. PT (UTC-7), midnight, and store activity and trades end at 2:45 a.m. leading up to the system coming down at 3:00 a.m. The system is estimated to return from downtime at 12:00 p.m.
