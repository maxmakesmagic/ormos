Ah, ah, ah! Welcome to my castle, traveler. Please, make yourself at home, won't you? We were just about to sit down for dinner—please, join us. We've got warm walnut walleye and a wasabi, watermelon, and watercress salad. Wonderful! We're so happy to have you. For dinner. But first, perhaps you'd like to admire some art? I had some wonderful portraits done recently by definitely-not-vampire artists Tomas Duchek, Nicholas Gregory, and Nils Hamm. I ordered them on the World Wide Web, and now so can you!

Have you seen our boy? He's about two feet tall (maybe three depending on artist's rendition); has one big, watery eye; answers to a name that sounds like someone blowing a raspberry? We hate the thought of him wandering the streets of Ravnica alone. Can you please take a look? We think he's hidden somewhere in this *Secret Lair* drop . . .


Yes, that's right. It's a five-card, borderless panorama by Marija Tiurina, and it's jam-packed with hidden *Magic* and Ravnica references. Please, can you find Fblthp on every card?

We're giving some of our *Secret Lair* test sheets a second life by upcycling them into the platforms you'll find within your *PixelSnowLands.jpg* boxes!


A limited number of these sheets are created to calibrate colors and image quality ahead of our full print runs, and we're exploring this as a way to reduce our industrial waste by repurposing these test sheets into *Secret Lair* packaging components.


It's snowing! It's snowing, everyone! Don't you love to just go outside and let the first snowflake fall on your tongue—WHY IS THIS SNOW SO POINTY? IT'S MADE OF PIXELS! IT'S SO SHARP! WE REGRET EVERYTHING!


Upon further review, we believe it's best to admire this beautiful pixelated snowscape by artist Jubilee from afar—like on a *Magic* card. These are some of the coolest snow basics we've ever printed, and they're exactly what you're looking for to elevate any deck or collection. Just skip the snowballs. Trust us.

WHAT IN THE HECK IS GOING ON, HERE?


We're super stoked to introduce *Secret Lair*'s very first Commander deck. That's right, for a limited time, you can grab a unique [100-card deck filled with tons of foils](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/heads-i-win-tails-you-lose-commander-decklist-2021-11-18), ten pieces of killer new art (across five cards; we will explain), and a bunch of other goodies like a unique flippin' coin and life wheel.


REVERSIBLE CARDS? WHAT IN TARNATION ARE THOSE?


Reversible cards are a cool new piece of *Magic* tech we're excited to debut here. It's a relatively straightforward concept, but it results in some awesome-looking cards. These are double-sided cards, but they have the same functional card on each side. However, each side has different art. You can swap which side you want to show off when casting the spell, or just stick with your favorite. You can even flip a coin to pick! It's just another way you can express yourself when playing the game.


NEAT! WHAT'S THE DECK DO?


This deck is from Gavin Verhey's secret vault, and it's a blast to play. Here's some words from the man himself:


"I've loved Zndrsplt and Okaun ever since I made them in *Battlebond*—and this Commander deck out of my personal collection puts them center stage! It looks so lovable and innocent . . . and then by the time you've started attacking people for lethal, it's too late to stop your coin-flipping reign of terror.


"You'll want to spend the early turns building up your mana rocks and Equipment and playing some silly coin-flip cards. Then, start deploying your Commanders! Usually, I suggest starting with Zndrsplt so you can start flipping coins and drawing cards. Your opponents will think it's so cute and laugh. 'Look at the funny coin-flip deck! Haha.'


"And that's when you know you've got them. Deploy Okaun—the way this deck normally kills. If you have some Equipment, suit him up! You just need to win three coin flips to kill with Okaun using Commander damage—and maybe less with the right Equipment. I've attacked for over 10,000 damage with a single Okaun before! They'll try to remove it, but that's what your counterspells are for. If there are creatures in the way, you can sneak it through with cards that grant unblockability. Or if you really want the table to flip out, use Chandra's Ignition so your 10,000 power (or similar) Okaun kills the whole table at once!


"If you have any questions about how the deck plays, you can hit me up on Twitter [@gavinverhey](https://twitter.com/GavinVerhey). Enjoy!"
