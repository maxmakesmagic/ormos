**Did you team up with anyone to practice for this Pro Tour? Who?**


I drafted with random locals. I did not practice Standard.

Green-Blue no removal and red-green planeswalkers. The red-green deck was my favorite, because planeswalkers.

Red-White Vehicles. I wanted something reasonably aggressive, since I had very little time to prepare.

The [Metalwork Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalwork+Colossus) deck was sweet!

No.

Draft 1: White-blue tokens


Draft 2: Blue-black energy


I liked them both.

Grixis Control. I like control.


[Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk).

The deck that came in first, White-Red Tokens

**Age:** 24


**Hometown:** Athens, Greece


**Occupation:** Student


**Limited Record:** 5-1


**Constructed Record:** 8-0-2


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 


Was unbeaten against Socrates Rozakeas, but recently lost the streak.


**Did you team up with anyone to practice for this Pro Tour? Who?**


My friends back in Greece, Panagiotis Savvidis, George Volakis, Socrates Rozakeas, Bill Tsorbatzidis, Bill Chronopoulos, and many more that helped me get here. Without them this would not have been possible.


**What archetypes did you draft? Which was your favorite?**


U/W Fliers, W/B Artifacts. No favorites really.


**What Standard deck are you playing and why? What card from *Kaladesh* made it possible?**


R/W “Tokens.” Both aggressive 1-drops and [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter) are the deck's core.


**What Standard deck, other than your own, impressed you the most this weekend?**


The decks that utilize [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk). The card seemed fine, but it is much stronger than I initially thought.


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


Getting to play in the World Championship would be pretty special.

**Age:** 29


**Hometown:** Paris, France


**Occupation:** Healthcare Consultant


**Limited Record:** 5-1


**Constructed Record:** 8-2


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 


2nd PT Theros, 3 GP Top 8s, 3rd at WMC 2015


**Did you team up with anyone to practice for this Pro Tour? Who?**


Team Renaissance, a gathering of the top French players like PT Champ Remi Fortier, Silver Pros


**What archetypes did you draft? Which was your favorite?**


Draft 1: B/G, 3-0. It is by far my favorite, flexible, deep, with the ability to splash for removals.


Draft 2: U/W, 2-1. I do not like it, but [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter) was good.


**What Standard deck are you playing and why? What card from *Kaladesh* made it possible?**


Blue-Red [Dynavolt Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dynavolt+Tower), because that is the best way we found to beat “Level 1” (B/G Delirium and R/W Vehicles). Kevin Chiche had the original idea. Obviously it depends on [Dynavolt Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dynavolt+Tower)!


**What Standard deck, other than your own, impressed you the most this weekend?**


[Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel), obviously. It is more consistent than I thought, and much better at beating control than one would think.


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


Proof that I still progress as a *Magic* player even though I cannot grind as much as before, and a spot in my dream tournament: The World Championship. But more importantly, it would show how well my team worked.

**What Standard deck are you playing and why? What card from *Kaladesh* made it possible?**


U/W [Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash). It performed really well against almost everything, has game against both aggro and control. [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter) was the best card in the deck.


**What Standard deck, other than your own, impressed you the most this weekend?**


Grixis Control. I was working on a similar list but locked in U/W because I wanted to focus on limited preparation.


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


It would be a dream come true. I've imagined being on the Sunday Stage ever since I learned what the Pro Tour was.

Red-Green Creatures. They are just too big. [Peema Outrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peema+Outrider) is just great.


**What Standard deck are you playing and why? What card from *Kaladesh* made it possible?**


Red-White Vehicles with [Cultivator's Caravan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivator%27s+Caravan). It's a two-cost 5/5 if you use it properly. Big shout out to Chan Sju Wing and Wu Kon Fai. Two years ago we build [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) on the street and now put me into another Top 8. We will never forget that.


**What Standard deck, other than your own, impressed you the most this weekend?**


Grixis Control from Shota Yasooka. True Masterpiece.


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


I'm really not sure now. I've lost one semifinal and three quarterfinals before. Will this be my one time?

**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


It would mean the world. I've been playing on the Pro Tour for a long time without a Top 8, and capping off my first with a win would be huge.
