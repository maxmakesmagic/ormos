You ever have one of those days where things are going pretty great, you’re on the up-and-up at your job, then all of a sudden your new demonlord of a boss decides that *maybe* you’re too much of a go-getter and need to be punished? And then you find yourself turned into a maggot? And *then,* some frog comes along and decides its totally okay to eat you? And then, growing a little upset by all of this you, whatever you are at this point, decides to burst from the fleshy, froggy confines as a ravenous spirit of hunger and malice?


. . . Or maybe this sounds like just another Thursday.


Regardless, it’s time to turn that frog-spirit frown upside down, let loose some burbles and shrieks, and celebrate yargself!
