The [Player Rewards token cards](/en/articles/archive/player-rewards-tokens-2002-05-27) are just like other cards as far as art goes -- they each had to be commissioned and reviewed like any normal card in an expansion set would be. Since its Token Week, we should take a look at one of these tokens. So this installment of Sketches will focus on the new *Odyssey* Elephant Token by Arnie Swekel. 

### 1. Art Description

Ok, the tokens are a little different than regular cards in that there isn't a formal "art description." The artist was just told to show an elephant.

### 2. Sketch

The first sketch is the preliminary one submitted by Arnie; it shows an armored elephant being ridden by what looks like a cleric. While the piece is impressive, it didn't quite match what Call of the Herd and other elephant token generators were trying to do flavor-wise -- invoke the feeling of summoning an elephant from the Otarian wilds to assist you in your battle. So Arnie submitted a second sketch (below) that the team liked much better.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final piece. The overall tome is green -- there is no doubt that elephants are green creatures in the *Odyssey* block!

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today. Or as the lucky ones will see it in their mailboxes, rather.
