The Eldrazi deck that had been terrorizing Modern until the recent bannings has succesfully transitioned to Legacy. What makes this recent addition to the format's canon tick? Why is it doing so well? And should we be scared of the Eldrazi? Are you?


We asked a couple of pro players in attendance this weekend for their insight ...

*Joel Larsson*


**Pro Tour *Magic Origins* champion Joel Larsson:**  I'm a little bit scared, yes. It's the first Chalice deck that's reasonably and reliably aggressive. Previously, the only decks that could use [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) took a long time to close a game. [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher) doesn't. That's why it's so scary.

*Immanuel Gerschenson*


**Two-time Grand Prix champion Immanuel Gerschenson:** The lands—[Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin), [Eldrazi Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple), [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), and [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors)—are quite simply unfair. Over the course of a game, the deck will typically spend more mana than almost any other. Which in general is a huge advantage in *Magic*.

*Magnus Lantto*


**2014 *Magic Online* Champion Magnus Lantto:** It's popular because it's easy to get and easy to get into. It has a much lower barrier of entry than most decks in the format. Personally, I'm not afraid of the deck, but I chose Lands specifically because I expected a lot of Eldrazi.

*Alexander Hayne*


**Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* champion Alexander Hayne:**  The cards are generally powerful, [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) is a powerful tool against a lot of decks, and casting 4-mana spells off of two lands is obviously unfair. But the deck isn't necessarily that strong. It's missing out on all the great card selection in the format and the mana base can be clunky at times. Chalice for one is the scariest thing about the deck.
