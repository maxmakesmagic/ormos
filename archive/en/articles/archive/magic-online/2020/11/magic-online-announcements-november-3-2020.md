*Innistrad* Flashback Draft Ends Tomorrow
-----------------------------------------


As is Halloween tradition, players can enjoy bloodcurdling battles in *Innistrad* Flashback Draft! *Innistrad* Flashback Draft ends tomorrow—so you only have one day left to draft your favorite creepy creatures.


For more info on Flashback events, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/content/magic-online-limited-events#Cubeflashbackgauntlet).

Updated Alternate Play Schedule
-------------------------------


The alternative play schedule that was announced in the *Zendikar Rising* set article is changing!


We like to keep everyone aware of what's coming up, so here's what you can expect to see on *Magic Online* between now and the release of *Kaldheim*:


* October 28–November 4: ***Innistrad* Flashback Draft**. This is our Halloween tradition: three packs of *Innistrad*, just the way it was in 2011. Long may it . . . uh . . . stay spooky?
* November 4–18: ***Vintage Cube***. Don't worry, this isn't replacing our end-of-year tradition of more *Vintage Cube*. But we've got a little event called the MOCS happening during this two-week run's second weekend, and it uses *Vintage Cube* as part of the competition. So, to ensure players have the ability to practice for the event, everyone gets an extra two weeks of *Vintage Cube*.
* November 18–25: **No events this week**. It's the launch weekend of *Commander Legends*, and there will be plenty of new and exciting events to play there!
* November 25–December 2: This week, a popular Cube Spotlight returns: Kyle O'Neill's ***Core Set Cube***, now updated through *Core Set 2021*! (Not to be confused with the kor set *Zendikar Rising*, which will still have full events running.)
* December 2–9: **Chaos Draft: *Masters* Sets**. For just this week, our Chaos Drafts are going to take only the top sets! Every set in this draft will be a *Masters* set, and it'll be glorious.
* December 9–16: **Supreme Draft: CHAOS!** Combining the fun of Supreme Draft with Chaos Draft, you'll draft a deck from 18 different packs. Which packs? Who knows? Enjoy the chaos!
* December 16–23: **A brand-new Cube Spotlight**. As usual, more details will come later, but this one promises to be a wheel of a good time.
* December 23–30: **Supreme Draft: *Vintage Cube***. What happens when you combine one of the most powerful formats ever with the most powerful Draft style? Yep. A week of that.
* Starting December 30 and running up until the week before *Kaldheim* releases: ***Vintage Cube***. Another update in, this time with *Commander Legends* cards in the mix. This is easily the most common request we get, so . . . we hear you. More *Vintage Cube*. This will last for a few weeks, until . . .
* The Wednesday eight days before the *Kaldheim* release, right up until we turn that set's events on: ***Vintage Masters* Flashback**. One of the most popular Draft formats of all time is back to round out *Zendikar Rising* season. We'll have a little more than a week of that, and then . . . well, it's not quite time to talk about *Kaldheim* just yet.

Showcase Challenge Weekend
--------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend. These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and a Split Championship invitation.


First up on Saturday, November 7, we have the Standard (6 a.m. PT), Modern (8 a.m. PT), and Vintage (10 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Then on Sunday, November 8, we finish off with the Pioneer (6 a.m. PT), Legacy (8 a.m. PT), and *Zendikar Rising* Sealed (9 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in December.
