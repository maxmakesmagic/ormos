### Game 1

Eskeland won the roll and kept his hand but Gomersall decided to double mulligan. Eskeland's deck produced a turn two [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), turn three [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). An end of turn Looter activation got him another card and a [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla). Pumped to three the Rootwalla and [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) dealt five damage and then a [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) stocked the graveyard. Gomersall could only laugh as he finally drew a third land which was the comes into play tapped [Lonely Sandbar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lonely+Sandbar).

"You need a miracle" retorted Eskeland!

A flash backed [Roar of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) is [Memory Lapse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse)d by the Englishman but [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) meant it hit play and a final attack reduced the badly mana screwed Gomersall to 0.

Eskeland 1 – Gomersall 0

### Game 2

Gomersall decided to play and both players kept their opening hands. The first action of the game came at the end of turn three with a [Krosan Verge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Verge) activation from Gomersall followed by a turn four [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Eskeland's start of four [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s and no creatures suggests a hand full of green spells. Gomersall cast another [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) during his next turn and had to discard a land the end of it but Eskeland had finally found a spell he could cast. [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) gave him enough cards in hand to allow the discard of two [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla)s at the end of his turn. However Gomersall took advantage of Eskeland being tapped out to cast [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) and [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari).

First blood went to the Norwegian as his Rootwalla's attacked for two followed up by a [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) for [Roar of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm), [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Ray of Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation) which was immediately used to destroy [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). On his turn Gomersall flashed back [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), played another land and cast [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). Eskeland decided to [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) the [Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath) but even though he had mana open Gomersall had no response, suggesting he was fishing for the [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). Eskeland attacked for two and cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) which was met by a [Memory Lapse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse) confirming the Englishman's plan. Now with the big Norwegian tapped out he could cast [Mirari's Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake) giving him lots of mana and great board position.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/euro03/a892.jpg)Eskeland once again attacked for two and tried to [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) but again a [Memory Lapse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse) did it's job. Gomersall now just draws a card and passes. For the third time Eskeland casts [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and it is met with yet another [Memory Lapse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse). Gomersall [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari)'s an [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) at EOT then drew and passed unable to find anything else to do. Eskeland casts [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) for the fourth time but it is finally counterspelled and the Englishman could sigh with relief that the danger had passed.

Another turn for Eskeland, another attempt at [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and of course another [Memory Lapse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse) from Gomersall who just could not seem to draw anything dangerous. Inevitably the next turn drew a sixth attempt at [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) which finally got through. The Norwegian played a land and discarded two [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla)s at the end of his turn and Gomersall scooped as there wouldn't be time for him to recover before being beaten to death by the two lizards.

**Final Result:** Eskeland 2 – Gomersall 0
