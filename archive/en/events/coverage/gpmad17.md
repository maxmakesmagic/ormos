Day 2 Coverage



625 teams, a whopping 1,875 players, had entered the tournament in total. 135 of these teams made it to the second day. Eventually, four teams sat down for the playoff matches, but only one trio could claim the title and hoist the trophies.


The Top 4 had featured *ten* different deck archetypes, no small feat considering the nature of Team Unified Modern, more a testament to the huge diversity of Modern in general. The Top 4 had also featured teams from Germany (including Pro Tour *Ixalan* quarterfinalist Christian Hauck), from Belgium, and from South America (including Gold pro Luis Salvatto).


In the end, however, no one could stop Spain's own Rodrigo Togores, Cristian Ortiz Ros, and Adrian Ramiro Cano. Each of them had been to the Top 8 of a Grand Prix once before, although only Togores had been able to earn a trophy so far. Now each of them could have a trophy (and eat it too, apparently) as they were crowned champions of Grand Prix Madrid 2017!

### Bonus Decklists: Tied for Fourth Place


by Tobi Henke




 It was clear that the trio of Marius Heuser, Christian Hauck, and Xiaoliang Yang would have the best tie breakers, what with their 10-0 start into the tournament. So when these three entered the...](/en/events/coverage/gpmad17/bonus-decklists-tied-fourth-place-2017-12-10)





Day 1 Coverage



What had begun with 625 teams in the morning was reduced to 135 by day's end. Leading the charge into the second day was the trio of Xiaoliang Yang, Christian Hauck, and Marius Heuser as the sole team to escape with a pristine record of 9-0.


Tough competition wasn't far behind however. Four-time GP semifinalist Louis Deltour and Pro Tour champion Remi Fortier and Jasper Grimmer with his three previous GP Top 8s and Thoralf Severin as well as Francesco Giorgio with two of these and Grand Prix champion Amand Dosimont and Grand Prix champion Rodrigo Togores—all of their teams finished the first day at 8-1. Possibly even more fearsome teams—Hall of Famer Raphaël Lévy, GP champion Loïc Le Briand, and 2014 Player of the Year Jérémy Dezany as one example, or the trio of Thomas Hendriks, Ivan Floch, Ondřej Stráský with six Pro Tour Top 8 finishes among them—were lurking at 21 points.


So it was going to be an exciting second day here at Grand Prix Madrid. Check back then, for news and updates, for decklists and more!
