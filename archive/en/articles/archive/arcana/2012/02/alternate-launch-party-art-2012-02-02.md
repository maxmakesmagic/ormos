The [*Dark Ascension* Launch Party](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/release-facts) starts on Friday. That means that it's the first time you can go to your local store and purchase some *Dark Ascension*! And it also means fun fun fun! The kind of fun that comes with alternate-art promos just for participating, while supplies last!


And the existence of alternate art means Arcana fodder, since we again get to look at how two different artists interpret the same art direction. And since it's a double-faced card, we get to do that *twice*. Let's go!


### Mondronen Shaman



> 
> Color: Red creature
> 
> 
> Location: Unimportant
> 
> 
> Action: The camera is tight on a person's face with one creepy blood-red eye and normal eye (gender is your choice). He/she is holding a candle that burns with red flame. The face is lit entirely by the candle. This is a fire-wielding shaman who becomes a werewolf.
> 
> 
> Focus: The shaman
> 
> 
> Mood: My soul is split in half.

### Tovolar's Magehunter



> 
> Color: Red creature
> 
> 
> Location: Outside at night
> 
> 
> Action: Show the Mondronen Shaman transformed into a werewolf. The werewolf also has one red eye and one normal eye. Show the werewolf springing toward the viewer. A blood-red full moon is in the background framing the werewolf. The camera should be close enough for us to appreciate the eye colors.

> 
> Focus: The werewolf

> Mood: This is my "better" half.

### The Cards
