Aside from Chris Fennell's match again Fernarndo Aguilar, which you can read about above courtesy of Nate Price, the final round for Day One of Grand Prix Mexico City featured three distinct 5-2 record matches that we wanted to bring you. The winners of these matches advance into Day Two of competition, but those who emerge from this round with a 5-3 record will be eliminated from the main event.


One of these bubble-matches has been covered in full by Nate Price. You can read up on what transpired during those games in the Round 8 Feature Match. Here are some quick notes on the other two bubble-matches that we were eying.



### Luis Eduardo Garcia vs. Andres Martinez



Our first bubble-match featured Grand Prix Guadalajara 2013 Champion Andres Martinez facing off against Luis Eduardo Garcia. Martinez has had quite the battle ahead of him today. Starting off with no byes, his red-black deck featuring some big hitters such as [Flame-Wreathed Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame-Wreathed+Phoenix) kept him afloat today.

However, that run for Day Two came to an abrupt halt when Garcia's green-red monsters stomped their way onto the table. One of these monsters was [Arbor Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus), a creature that tends to match up quite well against mythic phoenixes. A timely [Fall of the Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fall+of+the+Hammer) and a couple of thunderous combat steps later, and Martinez's attempt at a second Grand Prix trophy from Mexico came to a close, with Garcia advancing into Day Two after his 2-1 win in the eighth round.



### Marco Gomec Marmolejo vs. No. 23 Ranked Player Craig Wescoe



Both Craig Wescoe and his opponent, Marco Gomec Marmolejo, were running red-green Sealed decks.


However, in both games, it was Marmolejo's creatures that came out on top, leaving the No. 23 Ranked Player at 5-3 and short of wins needed to make it into Day Two.
