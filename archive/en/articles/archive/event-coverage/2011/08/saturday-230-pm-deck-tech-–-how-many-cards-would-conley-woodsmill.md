*Conley Woods* |

Have you ever wondered how to draft the mill deck in *Magic 2012*? Conley Woods sat down for his draft on Day Two and opened a pack with Jace's[Archivist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archivist) -- a card that is very good even if you are not the mill deck -- and [Merfolk Mesmerist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Mesmerist). His second pack saw him take [Cemetery Reaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cemetery+Reaper) over a [Jace's Erasure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure). He proceeded to take blue and black cards throughout the remainder of the pack but when both the Mesmerist and enchantment came back around he was squarely on the mill plan.


In the second pack he was passed a second pick [Jace, Memory Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept) and he never looked back. In the end he had three [Jace's Erasure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure), one [Archivist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archivist), and the Jace to go along with SIX [Merfolk Mesmerist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Mesmerist)s (Before anyone at home panics, in Limited you are not bound by the same deck building restrictions that govern Constructed).

He also had a pair of [Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions) of Beyond but left them in the sideboard in what he describes as a deck building error and brought them in for every sideboard game over his black splash.


I got to watch him lose his second of three rounds to one of the most extreme sideboards I have ever seen. In the third game his opponent went up to 53 cards and brought in [Elixir of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality). Conley still came close to decking him twice but eventually succumbed to creatures and [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun). He was fine with that game loss but was a little salty about his own misplay in game one when he simply was not fluent with how deathtouch and trample interacted. He went 2-1 with the deck but it is certainly worth taking a look at:
