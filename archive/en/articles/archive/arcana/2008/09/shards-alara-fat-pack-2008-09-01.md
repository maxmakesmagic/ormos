We're doing something a little different with the *Shards of Alara* Fat Packs. They're going to look like this:

And like this:

And also like this:

By now, being a clever person, you have naturally deduced that they'll also look like this:

The contents for each Fat Pack will look like this:

The contents won't vary; you'll get the same stuff no matter which version you buy. Well, the contents of the eight (!) boosters will vary, obviously. You know what we mean. And see that thing labelled *A Planeswalker's Guide to Alara*? It's an excerpt from the extremely cool book.
