*Commander 2019* in Treasure Chests
-----------------------------------


Starting when we come up from downtime tomorrow, August 14, you'll be able to find *Commander 2019* cards in your Treasure Chests. The [Treasure Chest page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info) has all the details, but the quick version: 30% of chests will have a random C19 card, weighted by rarity. Four cards won't be available yet, though: Empowered Autogenerator; Elsha of the Infinite; Rayami, First of the Fallen; and Tahngarth, First Mate. These four cards will be released later, though, after we've fixed some remaining bugs on them.

CHAOS DRAFT! August 14
----------------------


Flex your deck-building skills during this week's CHAOS DRAFT!, a format that requires players to contemplate meta-archetypes over the curated archetypes typically found in a cube. CHAOS DRAFT! starts tomorrow, August 14, and runs for a week—plenty of time to smash face amidst the [Pandemonium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium).




---

You Choose the Flashback Winner: *Khans of Tarkir*
--------------------------------------------------


Outlasting all the competition, *Khans of Tarkir* won the first You Choose the Flashback contest, held over the last three weeks on Twitter. This has earned it a week of Flashback time, beginning August 21. Players can enter these Phantom drafts of three *Khans of Tarkir* boosters using either 10 event tickets, 2 *Khans* boosters and 2 event tickets, or 100 Play Points.


Additionally, Vintage Masters, the other finalist, performed so well that we will also be running a Flashback week of that format. We haven't announced the schedule for events post-*Throne of Eldraine* yet, but this VMA Flashback week will probably happen in November.

Next Spotlight Cube: *Grixis Cube*
----------------------------------


We know a lot of you really enjoyed the last Spotlight Cube. The next one, launching two weeks from tomorrow, is a doozy, too. Ryan Overturf ([@RyanOverdrive](https://twitter.com/RyanOverdrive) on Twitter) has a real treat for us: the *Grixis Cube*. Starting August 28, you can pretend that green and white don't exist and draft a Cube with deep archetypes and deeper dives into the three (and a half) supported colors! Click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/cube-spotlight-series-grixis-cube-2019-08-13) for a full design article talking about the Cube and the details of its awesomeness.

*Core Set 2020*: *Magic Online* Edition

Core sets are back! *Core Set 2020* events are well underway on *Magic Online* and [redemption began last week](https://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/products/magiconline/redemption), so now's the time to get in on the action. Seize your chance to play *Magic* in its purest form with this new core set, which features prominently the fiery Planeswalker Chandra Nalaar.

*Modern Horizons*—Two Weeks Left!
---------------------------------

Build Notes
-----------


[Desecrated Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecrated+Tomb) is no longer desecrated and functions properly.


[Flickering Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickering+Ward) correctly grants protection.
