### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gppra03/a909.jpg)Jiri chose to play first with his green/white deck splashing black, but Allan's white/black had the first play of the duel: a [Boneknitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneknitter). Morph got matched by morph turn 3 and first blood was drawn when Jiri unmorphed [Hystrodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hystrodon) on his 4th turn, drawing a card in the process. Allan kept 2 morphs to block the beast on the following turn, but it wasn't sent into the red zone, Jiri only played a swamp and [Aven Redeemer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Redeemer).

The green Ophidian attacked on the next turn into 2 morphs and a [Boneknitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneknitter), with Redeemer back up. Unfortunately, one of the morphs was an [Aphetto Exterminator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Exterminator). [Gluttonous Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Zombie) was the needed evasion for Allan to break through Jiri's [Aven Redeemer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Redeemer)-Timberwatch elf defense. An unblocked [Haunted Cadaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Cadaver) damaged Allan, forcing him to discard 2 [Whipgrass Entangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipgrass+Entangler) and [Sunfire Balm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunfire+Balm).

"I have to read it," said Jiri when Allan played the card he didn't discard: [Shieldmage Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shieldmage+Elder). The board was pretty much stalled with clerics on both side of the game and [Gluttonous Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Zombie) dealing 1 damage a turn because of the preventing bird. Allan didn't play a creature for a couple of turns, while Jiri's *Legions* kept coming with [Daru Lancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Lancer), 1 time amplified [Daru Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Stinger), Pearlspear courier, another [Timberwatch Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf), [Grassland Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grassland+Crusader), [Starlight Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starlight+Invoker) and morph. Finally Allan played some good spells: [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) on the Redeemer, to pass with his [Gustcloak Harrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier) and DA BOMB: Soulless one, 8/8 spirit linked. Jiri's [Starlight Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starlight+Invoker)s helped him to nullify Allan's efforts to break through, when he had nothing better to do. With 15 minutes left in the round, Allan was at a comfortable 14 life, while Jiri was still at 20, would there be a winner here ? Yes, Jiri's overwhelming creature army was able to break through Allan's defense with 5 minutes left in the round. 

Jiri Lebeda - Allan Christensen 1-0

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gppra03/a907.jpg)Allan chose to play first game 2 and kept his hand, so did Jiri. Allan played as fast as he could, turn 2 [Battlefield Medic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic), turn 3 [Whipgrass Entangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipgrass+Entangler), turn 4 [Akroma's Devoted](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Devoted), matched by morph turn 3 and 4 by Jiri. Some beats went through with the help of [Whipgrass Entangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipgrass+Entangler). Even Jiri's freshly cast [Primal Whisperer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Whisperer) couldn't block the army of clerics. But then Jiri found his first black card in two games: [Misery Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misery+Charm).

Losing the [Whipgrass Entangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipgrass+Entangler) proved game deciding, as Allan wasn't able to break through. The fifth additional turn was over and Allan showed his [Profane Prayers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Profane+Prayers), which could have won the game in time, without the black charm.

**Final Result:** Jiri Lebeda beats Allan Christensen 1-0
