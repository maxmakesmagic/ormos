Magic: The Gathering Invitational 2000 Formats
==============================================



 Posted in **Feature**












The preliminary rounds of the **Magic** Invitational will consist of fifteen matches (best two out of three) with each player facing off against every other player once. The two players with the best record at the end of the fifteen rounds will meet in the finals. The finals will consist of three matches (best two out of three games each) with the two finalists playing each of the three constructed formats. The winner will be the first player to win matches in two formats. Order of these final matches will be determined by blind voting submitted by the players at the player meeting.

### Limited Formats


All limited events will have a forty card deck minimum size restriction. The following are the limited formats used at the 2000 **Magic** Invitational:


1. **Duplicate** - All competitors will receive an identical card mix from which to construct their deck.
2. **Solomon Draft** - This is a two player draft format. A randomly selected player begins by flipping up eight cards from the top of the card pile. He divides the eight cards into two piles (the piles need not be of the same size) allowing the other player to chose which pile to draft. The two players alternate dividing and drafting until all the cards have been selected. Each match will have a new draft involving different cards.
