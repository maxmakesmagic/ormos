Brumby is a mainstay in the New Zealand scene, known to players across the country for both his long play history (he's represented the country at Worlds 3 times!) and his role in the community as a local game store owner and very active trader. Huang has made multiple GP Top 8's and is a member of Team mtgmintcard, whose players have been posting strong results in recent events worldwide. Their last feature match ended in a draw that left both players out of contention, and they sat down with a friendly keenness to settle old scores.


This matchup is all about efficient, aggressive creatures clobbering the heck out of each other in a variety of ways. While Brumby's G/W shell packs the most power, card-for-card, Huang has access to more strategic flexibility in his tricks, 'fight' effects, and the top of his mana curve features [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) and [Polukranos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater), two difficult cards for Brumby's deck to oppose effectively.


Both players started the match with a mulligan to 6. Huang led off with an [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), Both played scried their tickets out of Mulligan Town, Huang accelerating off a [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) into a [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon), while Brumby had a [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) and then an [Experiment One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One) and another Voice.

Huang, proud controller of a pro-white Dragon, thought the best thing to do would be double up with another, sending both monsters crashing through the air at Brumby. Another turn of this hyper-aggressive nonsense, and Brumby was ready for his sideboard.


Whilst sideboarding, Brumby smiled at the ineffectual role his Voices of Resurgence had played last game. "They're the most glorified [Grizzly Bears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears) I've ever run", Brumby quipped.


**Hao-Shan Huang 1 - Gene Brumby 0**
Both players sent their openers back once more. Brumby opened with a [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), while Huang had an [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) to kick things along. Huang used his extra mana to ramp into a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and a second [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic). Brumby flashed in a [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) and untapped, eager to get his creatures into combat. Huang stopped the Lion with his Courser and took a nibble. Brumby followed up with an [Experiment One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One) and a second [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), bolstering his army considerably.


Huang summoned a [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) just in time for Brumby to draw a [Plummet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet), summoning his third Lion and attacking. Huang, a [Ghor-Clan Rampager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Rampager) sitting atop his deck, looked to have few good options against the incoming wave. He gang-blocked one of the Lions and fell to a precarious life total, needing to move to the defensive against Brumby's army.

A [Polukranos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) certainly seemed like it was going to help Huang out, especially when it was joined by a [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade) the following turn. Brumby kept attacking, pushing damage through where he could in an effort to race the terrifying monster. Brumby summoned a [Loxodon Smiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter) and then an [Arbor Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus). [Polukranos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) went monstrous and, with Domri's aid, took out both of Brumby's top-end creatures.


Brumby, running low on dudes, was under pressure to finish Huang off before he could further stabilise. On Brumby's attack, Huang assigned blockers but left the [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) unopposed. When he went to finish it off with a [Destructive Revelry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Revelry), Brumby flashed his topdecked Rootborn Defences to keep his attacker alive and take the second game by the most narrow of margins.

The third game came as almost a repeat of the first. Brumby deployed a pile of aggressive early creatures and had double [Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm) in hand, but Huang simply chose to ignore Brumby's plan of action and once again summoned a pair of [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon)s to take the game and match.
