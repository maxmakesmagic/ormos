**Skarren / Hayne / Wescoe vs. Thompson / Cho / Utter-Leyton**



Day 2 of Team Limited Grand Prix is a bustle of movement. The best teams have a tight radius to turn for the Top 4 slots, and after a full day of Saturday Sealed the opposition is just as warmed up to the challenge. Complicating matters is the relative strength of teams continues to rise.





*Spirits were high on both sides of the table. From left to right: Craig Wescoe, (17) Alexander Hayne, Frank Skarren, (14) Josh Utter-Leyton, Josh Cho, Gerry Thompson.*
