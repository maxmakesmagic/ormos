The Orzhov love their stained glass; it can be seen on a number of cards from *Gatecrash*, such as the most obvious example:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/1203_shrine.jpg)It also inspires the magic of the Orzhov, such as is visible on [Gift of Orzhova](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Orzhova).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/1203_gifts.jpg)But obviously stained glass has appeared in **Magic** cards for many years. Take for example the *Portal Second Age* card [Temple Acolyte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Acolyte).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/1203_acolyte.jpg)Perhaps the currently most famous piece of stained glass in **Magic** is the terrifying view on [Endless Ranks of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Ranks+of+the+Dead).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/1203_ranks.jpg)Or the more abstract [Halcyon Glaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halcyon+Glaze). Halcyon is a term that refers to a period in the past which was idyllic and happy. Not that that necessarily explains this beautiful art.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/1203_halcyon.jpg)To the much more recent example [Fires of Undeath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fires+of+Undeath), which features a more monochromatic stained glass example.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/1203_fires.jpg)There are a number of other examples of cards featuring stained glass. Have a favorite I don't include here? [Tweet me](http://twitter.com/trickmtg) or send me a feedback email below!
