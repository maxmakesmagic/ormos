Dominaria’s present is an apocalyptic wasteland battered by storms of time. In the *Time Spiral* set, however, some timeshifted cards represented glimpses of more innocent times. Dominaria’s past lived again in cards like [Ith, High Arcanist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ith%2C+High+Arcanist) or [Saffi Eriksdotter.](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saffi+Eriksdotter.)

*Planar Chaos* has timeshifted cards too, but they’re a little more… complex. You might say that *Planar Chaos’s* timeshifted cards represent glimpses of more *bizarre* times.

*When did this ever happen? – Art by Greg Staples*
You know that the present look of [green](/en/articles/archive/time-spiral-style-guide-green-2006-10-02) in the *Time Spiral* style guide is washed-out, sickly, and spare. So what gives with all the noble evergreens in the art above, or the greenery shown on [Groundbreaker](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/making/mr261_at4p9xfsp1tjef48.jpg), or the verdant scene fourth from the top on [this page of the minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/planarchaos2/creative1)? 

![Greenseeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Greenseeker)Those cards depict a world of Dominaria’s ancient, alternate past—recognizable, but each with its own set of divergent details, and far enough back that they predate the various wars, invasions, and ascendant god-beings that have wrecked the plane in the current era. The time rifts may be a symptom of planar cataclysm, but they may also bring hope to Dominarian survivors. Maybe the plane’s [Greenseeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greenseeker)s will have something to find now, thanks to all the *Planar Chaos*.
