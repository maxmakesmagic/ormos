### September 1-5, 2004: Nuijten, Nassif dominate Worlds


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds04/final.jpg)After five days of play across four different formats, Julien Nuijten, the 15-year-old player from the Netherlands emerged on top of a tough Sunday field to become the youngest player in the game's history to win a Pro Tour title.


It was quite a weekend for **Magic**'s newest superstar, showcasing what a dominant force the Netherlands has become in **Magic** (joining him in the Top 8 was countryman Kamiel Cornelissen). It was also a strong weekend for Canada, with two Canadians in the Top 8â€”19-year-old finalist Aeo Paquette and quarterfinalist Murray "The Mauler" Evans. Joining Nuijten and Paquette in the semifinals were France's Manuel Bevand and Japan's Ryo Ogura. Terry Soh of Malaysia and one *other* player rounded out the Top 8.


That player was Gabriel Nassif, who made his third Pro Tour Top 8 of the season this weekend. Between his Top 8 appearance and a Top 12 showing by his French National team, Nassif won the Player-of-the-Year Race -- an award he had locked up by Saturday afternoon. He earned himself $20,000 in end-of-year money and got all of his travel and accommodations for the next year of Pro Tours taken care of courtesy of Wizards of the Coast. As a testament to his season-long consistency, he earned the Player of the Year without winning a Pro Tour event -- the first time that happened in the history of the award.


The Team Championships ended in heart-breaking dramatic fashion as the final match was decided with the winner clinging on to his final point of life. The Belgian National Champion, Vincent Lemoine missed a point of damage earlier in the game and he was never able to finish German National Champion Torben Twiefel off to seal the victory. Instead, Germany took the Team Championship back on the shoulders of Twiefel, Sebastian Zink, and Roland Bode. Zink is the twin brother of 2003 World Champion, Daniel Zink.
