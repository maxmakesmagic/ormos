Remember when you got to [pretend to be in R&D](/en/articles/archive/whose-desk-2008-03-31), and it took the form of trying to guess which desk was which? We're doing it again, except that this time you get to be a member of a really prestigious team: the web team! I hear those guys are really cool.


You will be taking the role of a new member of the team. Your first challenge: find your own desk!



### Challenge One: Bill Stark


You are [Bill Stark](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/458), intern. You arrive bright and early in the morning and pause for a moment. Which desk is yours? When you think you've got the right one, go ahead and click on it to see if you're right!

### Challenge Two: Kelly Digges


Yes, your desk is the one that has had the least time to accrue piles of stuff all over it. Your first assignment this morning requires you to talk to Kelly Digges (editor of **magicthegathering.com**) for an idea you've had for an Arcana. Kelly's desk has to be around here *somewhere*....

### Challenge Three: Monty Ashley


Kelly signs off on your idea and corrects some grammar, but points out that he's not actually the one who writes Arcanas these days. You're going to have to find Monty and see if there's an open Arcana slot. Go!

### Postgame: Whoo-hoo!


Monty seems a little impatient at first, but it turns out that he loves your idea, possibly because it means he doesn't have to come up with an Arcana for the next day. There is rejoicing all around, followed by lunch. Well done!
