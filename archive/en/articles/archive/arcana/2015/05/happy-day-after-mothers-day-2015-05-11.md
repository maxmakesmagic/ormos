You all showered your mother with presents and praise yesterday, right? Flowers and tickets to her favorite show? A spa day and making dinner for her?



Here at DailyMTG.com, we all took the time to make our mothers feel special, but we also took the time to visit with the mothers in *Magic*.



There are six mother in *Magic* and one grandmother, all of which we covered in [A Family Affair](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/family-affair-2014-12-24) a while ago. But we don't want to just run through the list. Not on their special day. Or even the day after their special day. We want to really stop and consider their beauty. We want to stop and consider some of theirâ€¦art descriptions.



Sure, why not. We're doing a whole Mother's Day thing here.



So Happy Mother's Day to all of our mothers, all of the mothers in the *Magic* community, and to these beautiful women crafted from the art descriptions below.

[Dragon Broodmother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Broodmother) | Art by [Jamie Jones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Jamie%20Jones%22%5d)



**Color:** Red and green creature


**Location:** Inside a volcanic geode on Jund



**Action:** In the primal land of Jund, dragons nest deep inside volcanic chambers, where the walls are covered with blood-red crystal formations: sangrite. Show an immense cavern like this where a huge dragon has flown down from an opening at the top and is about to land in a nest of bones, rock shards, and trees. The nest contains two or three of her hatchlings (no eggs in sight, though).



**Focus:** the dragon


**Mood:** It's feeding time for the wee ones.

[Sakiko, Mother of Summer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakiko%2C+Mother+of+Summer) | Art by [Michael Sutfin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Michael%20Sutfin%22%5d)



Orochi Shaman


**Color:** Green


**Location:** forest



**Action:** Show a beautiful female snakefolk shaman. She is powerful and vivacious, and can lead other snakefolk into battle with a word. It would be good if there were some indication that she can command green mana.



**Focus:** Sakiko, the female snakefolk shaman


**Mood:** charismatic, energetic, intense

[Mother of Goons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Goons) | Art by [Darrell Riche](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Darrell%20Riche%22%5d)



This art should show [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247525) gone bad. She's dressed like a street tough, and a few other tough-looking people are standing behind her to back her up. One of them is holding her cup of tea for her. She should be sneering and posturing. To make it recognizable as [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247525), she should have the same haircut and similar colors in her clothes.
