 Jacob Wilson, currently ranked 11th in the world, has quickly risen up from obscurity to be one of the most impressive *Magic* players in the world. In just a few years of competitive play, Wilson has already managed to Top 8 four Grand Prix events, winning two of them, and he finished in the finals of a Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*. Wilson is currently preparing for his debut at The World Championship, the pinnacle of *Magic* competition.




 I sat down with Wilson for a conversation about *Magic*, life, and his personal expectations.
