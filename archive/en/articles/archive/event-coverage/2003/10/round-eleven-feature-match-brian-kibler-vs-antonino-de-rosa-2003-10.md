### Game One

The general consensus of the people in draft pod two is that Brian Kibler’s deck is ridiculous. Not only did Brian open Glissa but he was passed Molder Slug. People weren’t thinking of him as a bomb when the weekend opened, but a lot of minds have been changed this weekend. 

Ken Krouner was dragged through the sealed portion by his Molder Slug, he only won two games all weekend long when he didn’t see it. Brian has had similar success with it as well.

De Rosa agrees, “His deck is better by far, not a question.” 

Both players were very content with their opening hands and game started quickly. Leonin Skyhunter was the first creature from Kiblers green/white monstrosity, and he started swinging with him while Antonino started off with nothing but lands.

“I literally have no chance,” De Rosa commented when Kibler played Raise the Alarm, “not a one.”

Turn four Glissa from Brian was met with a Regress from Antonino. “Did you think it would be this easy,” Antonino quipped. Brian played Glissa out again and tried to follow her up with Leonin Sun Standard but it was countered by Override.

The two players started to show off cards because Antonino had about given up at this point. “I have these,” Antonino mentioned, showing off Wurmskin Forger and Broodstar. Brian had that trumped though, showing off what he called, “Pocket Arrests.”

Antonino wanted to take a moment to apologize to the Sideboard readers for not making that game interesting to read about. Kibler rolled him quickly, never even having to cast the “Pocket Arrests.”

### Game Two

The two players shuffled up for game two with Antonino still being disgusted over Brians “Poket Arrests.” Pounding on his deck before drawing his seventh card Antonino decided he had no choice but to keep seven cards, not wanting to give Brian any more advantage.

Brian started quickly, playing an Auriok Transfixer before Imprinting Raise the Alarm on the Isochron Scepter. De Rose did play a Yotian Soldier of his own, but Brian had Raise the Alarm on a stick and it looked like his soldier army would be neverending.

Antonino was holding Deconstruct, but with no green mana on the table he was forced to just watch as Brian continued to play creatures from the Scepter.

“Green land…green land…be there,” Antonino asked. He finally ripped it, but complained that he still couldn’t do anything. A bit of an understatement, as he used Deconstruct to dispose of the Scepter and then used the three green mana to play Viridian Shaman. 

Brian didn’t seem to care, as he just dropped Glissa and started in on the artifacts of Antonino. 

Antonino played Serum Tank, it died immediately to Glissa, with the mana used to power out an Elf Replica. Antonino played a Bonesplitter, which lasted only one turn before Glissa killed it as well. 

Someone once said that Mirrodin is about playing your bombs, Glissa is a bomb, play her.

The game continued with Antonino playing out Vulshok Battlegear, about the only option he had in his hand. Brian didn’t even make an effort to destroy it, with the game firmly in hand.

It’s official, Brian’s deck is ridiculous.
