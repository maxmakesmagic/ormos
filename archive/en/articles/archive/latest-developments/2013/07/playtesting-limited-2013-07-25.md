When a set comes to development from design, it has the proverbial ten fingers and ten toes, but it tends to be pretty far from ready for primetime play. That's good, as it means that I have a job. Each design team has a development member on it, to help cost the cards and make sure that their Limited environment is somewhat balanced, but that really isn't the focus of that group—the focus is to design new and exciting cards that are fun. They do that mostly through Limited playtests, but their sensibilities are rightly somewhat different than development's, so there will always be some gap between what design hands off and what development believes is right for the set. Often, the set coming out of design is very much all about what is new and exciting in the set; it is development's role to play up what is working the best and incorporate it back into the more nuts-and-bolts version of **Magic** that people are used to playing. 

It is development's job to balance the set, but to also focus on making the set as fun as possible. But we also have to be concerned with more meta-concerns in terms of common word count and complexity, color balance, and making sure the set has enough depth to be played fifty or more times. We have a relatively limited amount of time to accomplish all of these goals, so we have come up with a number of processes to improve how we do what we do and make our playtesting sessions as fruitful as possible.

It All Starts with a Point
Before development does any Limited playtests, it's important that the team spends the time to quickpoint the set and try to get some of the most basic balancing done and make sure the colors (at least on a first pass) are all around the same power level. Quickpointing is a system we basically use to divide the set up into different power categories for Limited—A+s, As, Bs, and Cs.
