Despite some disagreement about the merits of splashing (see our earlier quick question) *Kaladesh* Limited, at its heart, appears to be a two-color format. There are ten pairs of possible two-color combinations. We asked some of the more notable players in attendance this weekend for their favorite and least favorite of them.

**2016 World Championship finalist Márcio Carvalho:** Blue-red is the worst combination. Blue simply is the worst color. Red-white, red-green, white-black are all good. White-black in particular has tons of synergy between all the fabricate and the artifacts-matter cards in black like [[Dhund Operative](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dhund+Operative), [Foundry Screecher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foundry+Screecher)].

**Hall of Famer Bram Snepvangers:** There's obviously some pairings that work very well. But everything is possible if you get the right combination of cards.

**24-time Grand Prix Top 8er Martin Jůza:** Unfortunately, there's a Pro Tour next week; magicians can't always share their secrets. But honestly, R&D did a pretty good job of balancing their colors. There's also no oppressive common like [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith). If [Renegade Freighter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renegade+Freighter) is the best common, in a format with maindeckable artifact removal, I can live with that.

**Pro Tour Prague 2006 quarterfinalist Quentin Martin:** Every single draft, I take the same role, which is to figure out which two colors are open. Every color and every combination has its own strengths and weaknesses. You just need to know what those are and draft accordingly. But from what I've seen, the red-green energy deck looks quite silly when it comes together.

**Grand Prix Rimini 2016 champion: Arne Huschenbeth:** All combinations can be good. Though white-black is a favorite, I guess.
