Last week, we discussed how you can protect yourself and your personal information (See [Part 1](/en/articles/archive/great-online-gaming-experiences-start-you-part-1-2011-06-22) of this series). This week, we’re focusing on scams and taking steps to ensure you don’t become a victim. 


**Be Wary of Websites That Offer **Magic Online** "Cheats"**


There are several informational websites out there for **Magic** players and fans, including Wizards of the Coast’s official **Magic: The Gathering** and **Magic Online** web pages as well as many reputable, third-party sites. It’s important, though, to be wary of websites purporting to be “official” or “authorized”, as these sites often engage in scams. 


There are no sanctioned cheats, hacks, mods, bots, or any other kind of attachments for the **Magic Online** game. Many times, when someone advertises a site that offers these things, the site will attempt to "mine" your password from your computer. Talking about, advertising, or patronizing such sites is a violation of the Code of Conduct, which means you may be suspended for doing so. 


**Watch Out For Other Scams**



Other sites will offer you something for free or at reduced value (i.e. “Free tix!”) just for logging in. These sites often require you to log in for your “free product” and then attempt to track your login and password. Don’t put your account in jeopardy for the promise of something free! As with most things in life, if the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. 


Another version of this scam requires you to fill out “surveys” or click on websites in order to earn your “free product”. Many of these surveys have hidden costs, especially those that have to be completed by cell phone. You may incur a large charge for taking these surveys on your cell phone bill. Clicking on unknown links and visiting unknown websites always carries a high risk. There’s always the potential for inadvertently installing malicious malware programs to your computer. These programs can do anything from logging your keystrokes as you enter login information to falsely alerting you of viruses and convincing you to buy more malicious programs to remove it. Always make sure that your computer’s virus protection is up to date! 


This information also applies to the download of any “Bot” software. Remember that unless you have programmed the bot yourself, you can’t be sure of what it will do. In some situations, malicious bot programs have been created and sold to unsuspecting users. These programs can compromise the safety of your account by communicating your password to the bot seller, or allowing them to access your account through “backdoors” in the bot. Wizards of the Coast cannot be responsible for any loss incurred as a result of using third party programs such as bots. 


The Wizards of the Coast Fraud Team fully investigates all reports of suspicious behavior. If you feel that you have been the victim of a scam, or if you have seen suspicious activity, please [report it](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1236/).
