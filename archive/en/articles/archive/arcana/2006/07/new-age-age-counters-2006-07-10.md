![Illusionary Forces](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Illusionary+Forces)Cumulative upkeep, last seen in the *Weatherlight* set, has spent nine long years on the bench. Its return in *Coldsnap* heralds a new age of cumulative upkeep trickiness not seen before in **Magic**: what if cumulative upkeep were not just a necessary cost, but also a way of keeping track of unique new effects? To see these new *Coldsnap* twists in action, we must first investigate the concept of the age counter.From the [Comprehensive Rules](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/rules/tourneyplayer): 


> 
> 502.13. Cumulative Upkeep
> 
> 
> 502.13a Cumulative upkeep is a triggered ability that imposes an increasing cost on a permanent. “Cumulative upkeep [cost]” means “At the beginning of your upkeep, put an age counter on this permanent, then sacrifice this permanent unless you pay [cost] for each age counter on it.”
> 
> 
> 

Cumulative upkeep has been worded like this for years now, and the Oracle text of cards like [Cyclone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclone) and [Heart of Bogardan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Bogardan) have taken advantage of the usefulness of age counters to template their abilities. 

![Glacial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Glacial+Plating)*Coldsnap* takes this to the extreme.* How'd you like [Earthen Goo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Earthen%2BGoo) every time you pay the upkeep? What about [Glacial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Glacial%2BPlating)?
* How'd you like to [Arctic Nishoba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Arctic%2BNishoba) or [Jotun Owl Keeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Jotun%2BOwl%2BKeeper) if you lose your fatty? (One of the most powerful examples of this was [Vexing Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Sphinx), [previewed over at Star City](http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/12245.html) last week.)
* How'd you like to [Hibernation's End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Hibernation%2527s%2BEnd) or [Phyrexian Etchings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Phyrexian%2BEtchings) every turn you pay the upkeep?

![Herald of Leshrac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Herald+of+Leshrac)It's not just *Coldsnap*'s attention to age counters that hold the new twists to cumulative upkeep. There are also some pretty oddball “costs”—again turning the notion of cumulative upkeep as a cost on its head.* How'd you like to [Herald of Leshrac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Herald%2Bof%2BLeshrac)?
* How'd you like a way to use cumulative upkeep to [Jotun Grunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Jotun%2BGrunt)?
* How'd you like an [Sheltering Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sheltering%2BAncient) (three of the most joyous words in **Magic**) who eventually stacks up too many +1/+1 counters to stick around?
* How'd you like to [Braid of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Braid%2Bof%2BFire)?

That's one way to make cost/benefit analysis easier—when costs *are* benefits.
