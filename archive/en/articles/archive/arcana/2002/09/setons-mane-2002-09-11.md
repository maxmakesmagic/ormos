Kamahl wasn't the only *Odyssey* character with [hair problems](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/36). Take a look at the original painting from [Seton's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Desire) by Ciruleo.

The art for [Seton, Krosan Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%2C+Krosan+Protector) by Greg Staples set the baseline for what Seton needed to look like. And in that picture, he had flowing dark hair (and no facial hair). So Ciruleo's work had to be altered to match. You can compare the before and after below.
