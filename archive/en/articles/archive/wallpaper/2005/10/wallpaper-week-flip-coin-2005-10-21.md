This week's desktop wallpaper is a mere coin-flip away. Try your luck and get one of these two *Mirage* coin-flipping cards -- either **[Frenetic Efreet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenetic+Efreet)** by Thomas Gianni or **[Aleatory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aleatory)** by Kev Walker. Which one will you get?


**Note:**  the neat coin-flipping thing doesn't work anymore, so you'll have to just pick the wallpaper you like. Sorry!
