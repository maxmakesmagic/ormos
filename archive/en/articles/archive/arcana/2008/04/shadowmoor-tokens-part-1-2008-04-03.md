The previews for *Shadowmoor* are going pretty well so far, don't you think? But so far we've only previewed the *cards.* How about some tokens?


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1561_SHMToken1.jpg)Ah, an Elf Warrior. Note how different he looks from the [*Lorwyn* Elf Warrior token](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1561_LRWElfWarrior.jpg). 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1561_SHMToken2.jpg)A 5/5 Elemental token! And it appears to be both black and red, too. Interesting.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1561_SHMToken3.jpg)Well, that seems logical enough. A 2/2 green Wolf token could certainly come in handy at times.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1561_SHMToken4.jpg)Yes, a 1/1 red and green Goblin token, that makes sense.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1561_SHMToken5.jpg)Well, here's something we didn't see much of in *Lorwyn*: our old friend, the rat!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1561_SHMToken6.jpg)And we close things out this time with a 1/1 white Kithkin Soldier. There will be another round of *Shadowmoor* token previews, though, so stay tuned!
