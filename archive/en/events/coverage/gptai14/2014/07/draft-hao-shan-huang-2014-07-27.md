 While you could look at Hao-Shan Huang's four GP top 8s and say that he's had a pretty reasonable *Magic* career to date, I know he's personally been very disappointed in the number of times he's just missed the cut on breakers, or stumbled in the quarterfinals, which has lead to Huang being one very determined *Magic* player.



While it looked like the tie-breakers might get messy before the cut to top 8 this afternoon, the results swung in the right direction and we had a clean cut at 37 points with Huang finishing in 8th. 



 Pack 1, pick 1, Huang settled on a [Spirit Bonds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Bonds) over an [Ulcerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulcerate). Afterwards Huang admitted that while [Ulcerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulcerate) is one of the best removal cards available, [Spirit Bonds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Bonds) is capable of much more.





*Hao-Shan Huang has his eyes on the trophy.*
