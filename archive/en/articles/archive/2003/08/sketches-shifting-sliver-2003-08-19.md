This week's "Sketches" goes under the sea to see the evolution of another blue Sliver from *Legions*, [Shifting Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shifting+Sliver). Darrell Riche got the assignment.


### 1. Art Description


These were the instructions given to the artist:


"Location: Underwater Riptide project  

 Action: Show a sliver either underwater or breaking the surface of the water, displaying an ornamented organic pattern covering its body."


Interestingly, at the time, [Shifting Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shifting+Sliver) did not give an evasion ability to other Slivers. Instead it was:

### 2. Sketches


Here is Darrell's original sketch. Perhaps he was thinking of a mystical cycling ability as he sketched the ornamentation on the Sliver's skin.


The art team was happy with everything except the cute little fishies. They wanted them either replaced with something stranger, or removed altogether.


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of the final piece. [Shifting Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shifting+Sliver) shifted over to having an evasion ability in development, but luckily the ornamented skin in its concept can still fit. Now it serves more as a camouflage role in the flavor of the card.


### 4. Card


And finally, here is the card as you can see it in booster packs.
