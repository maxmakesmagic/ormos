In *Battle for Zendikar* Limited, a focus on synergy can be very important. I asked some of the pros in attendance this weekend for their favorite two-card “combo” with common or uncommon cards.


Most of their answers were relevant for the black-white lifegain deck. Out of all archetypes in the format, that color combination may have the highest power-level ceiling. When walking around the deck construction tables after the first draft, I noticed that the best-looking decks were indeed the white-black ones, most likely from players who managed to monopolize those cards in their draft.

**No. 13 Ondřej Stráský:** "[Retreat to Hagra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retreat+to+Hagra) and [Kalastria Nightwatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Nightwatch). Got crushed by that on *Magic Online* two times already."

**Pro Tour *Magic Origins* champion Joel Larsson:"** "[Stone Haven Medic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Haven+Medic) and [Kalastria Nightwatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Nightwatch). It's a pretty nice combo that you can pick up as 8th or 9th pick cards, but they are really good in the black-white deck."

**Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar* 6-0 drafter Don van Ravenzwaaij:** "One draft I was able to get [Bane of Bala Ged](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+of+Bala+Ged) and [Adverse Conditions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adverse+Conditions). It was pretty filthy to keep exiling my opponent's permanents unopposed."

**Grand Prix Madison champion Raphaël Lévy:** "[Tajuru Warcaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tajuru+Warcaller) and [Unified Front](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unified+Front). It's good whether you play Unified Front first or last."

**Gold-level pro Robin Dolar:"** "[Kalastria Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Healer) and [Retreat to Emeria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retreat+to+Emeria). It gives you a steady stream of drain triggers."
