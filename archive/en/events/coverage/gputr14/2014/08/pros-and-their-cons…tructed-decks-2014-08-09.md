=====================================

While many of the world's top players, and even several of the European pros, have stayed in town after the Pro Tour for this weekend's Grand Prix Portland, over here, on this side of the Atlantic, the Dutch GP can boast its own line-up of famous and semi-famous players. The coverage team has compiled a list of 50 players to watch—and we've found out what deck each one of them is playing.



For reference, this is our complete list, including a number of newly-minted national champions, two Hall of Famers, two Pro Tour champions, at least eleven Grand Prix winners, one Judge Emeritus, and quite many people with Grand Prix and Pro Tour Top 8 experience:

Now it would be somewhat unfair to spoil everyone's deck choice, of course. However, what we can give you is a metagame breakdown of this field of 50. What decks did the known players pick? Here's what:





|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Deck:** | **Number:** |
| White-Blue Control | 10 |
| Mono-Blue Devotion | 9 |
| Red-White Burn | 9 |
| Black-Red-Green Planeswalkers | 7 |
| Black-White Midrange | 5 |
| Green-White Aggro | 5 |
| Rabble Red | 2 |
| Esper | 1 |
| Mono-Black Devotion | 1 |
| Mono-Black Aggro | 1 |


White-Blue Control claiming the top spot comes as no surprise as the deck did the same—not in numbers but in the hands of Ivan Floch—at Pro Tour *Magic 2015*. But there are big news here, namely the comparatively large number of players choosing Mono-Blue Devotion despite its lackluster showing at the Pro Tour. We'll find out later in the weekend whether this is a new trend or just an anomaly.
