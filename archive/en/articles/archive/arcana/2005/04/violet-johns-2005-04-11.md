Here at **magicthegathering.com** it's traditional for us to highlight examples of extreme dedication to the growth of the **Magic** brand. This site's Content Manager Scott Johns and his wife Jillian have gone above and beyond the call of duty by adding another **Magic** player to the world the old-fashioned way -- and in the especially important female demographic. 



Violet Johns was born at 2:32 PM on April 5th, 2005, at 20.5 inches, weighing 6 pounds, 9 ounces. The Johns' second child, she is healthy and the family is doing well.


Congratulations to the Johns family, and hats off to their market-expanding diligence!
