 Coming off an unconventional win for his Infect Deck, a [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch)-based beatdown, Tom Ross was ready to dish out infection again. Facing the same kinds of removal and countermagic he had already overcome all weekend, Ross pushed to get the go ahead and play – so much so he nearly started before being cleared.




 Across from him, after muscling out his Jeskai Miracles mirror match opponent, Philipp Schönegger looked set for the semifinal match. [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) is one of the many enemies to Ross's Infect deck, and given how happy Schönegger was with his deck it was obvious he felt comfortable on his side.




**The Games**




 After he kept his hand quickly, Ross led with a first turn [Glistener Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf) into a second turn [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch). With two poison counters on the board, [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) was the first answer from Schönegger.
