 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






It's time for another trivia column. Inspired by *Commander Legends*, I've decided to focus this one on legendary creatures. Want to see how many of the 30 questions you can answer correctly? Record your answers as you take the quiz and then check below to see how you did.


If you enjoy this column, I have two other trivia columns, [one about the various years of *Magic*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/how-trivial-2018-10-22) and [one about projects I've led](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/trivial-pursuit-2020-03-23).


My one caveat before I begin is that all these questions are as of *Commander Legends*.

2. Six
3. Seven
4. Eight

**Question #3** 


Of those same 55 legendary creatures from *Legends*, how many have we used to inspire new legendary creatures that are connected to those characters without actually being those characters?


1. Four
2. Five

**Question #22** 


Which of the legendary creatures from *Innistrad* won the rare poll (an internal polling where Wizards employees rank the cards) with the name of the trope we wanted the card to hit as its title, which led some to question the ranking because we weren't actually going to call it that?

**Answer to Question #1 – b. Six** 


The eight proper names of characters in *Alpha* were:


* Baron Sengir ([Sengir Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire))
* Chatzuk ([Helm of Chatzuk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Chatzuk))
* Gaea ([Gaea's Liege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Liege))
* Mishra ([Ankh of Mishra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ankh+of+Mishra))
* Nevinyrral ([Nevinyrral's Disk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nevinyrral%27s+Disk))
* Pashalik Mons ([Mons's Goblin Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mons%27s+Goblin+Raiders))
* Serra ([Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel))
* Urza ([Glasses of Urza](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glasses+of+Urza), [Sunglasses of Urza](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunglasses+of+Urza))

Baron Sengir, Mishra, Nevinyrral, Pashalik Mons, Serra, and Urza have all been printed as legendary creatures or planeswalkers (and Urza has been printed as both), but Chatzuk and Gaea have yet to be.

As of *Commander Legends*, we've seen new cards for Arcades Sabboth, Chromium, Jedit Ojanen, Nicol Bolas, Palladia-Mors, Ramirez DePietro, and Vaevictis Asmadi. Nicol Bolas has seen the most reprints, all as planeswalker cards. He had cards in *Conflux*, *Hour of Devastation*, *Core Set 2019*, and *War of the Spark*. The other four Elder Dragon legends appeared in *Core Set 2019*. Jedit Ojanen had an alternate-reality version in *Planar Chaos* where he didn't forsake the forest. Ramirez DePietro shows up as a ghost in *Commander Legends*.


**Answer to Question #3 – a. Four**

We've made legendary creatures that have referenced Dakkon Blackblade, Rohgahh of Kher Keep, Tetsuko Umezawa, and Ur-Drago. Rohgahh's son Rograkh shows up in *Commander Legends*, we met another wielder of the Blackblade in *Future Sight*, we've met two members of the Umezawa bloodline in *Betrayers of Kamigawa* and *Dominaria*, and we've met two versions of the Ur-Dragon (in *Time Spiral* and *Commander (2017 Edition)*) connected to Ur-Drago.


**Answer to Question #4 – c. Two** 


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1646)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1646)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soraya+the+Falconer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soraya+the+Falconer)
[Ayesha Tanaka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ayesha+Tanaka) from *Legends* has banding, and [Soraya the Falconer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soraya+the+Falconer) from *Homelands* can grant it to Birds (originally just to Falcons, but we consolidated all the bird creature types into just Bird during the Grand Creature Update).


**Answer to Question #5 – d. [Lord of Tresserhorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Tresserhorn)** 


[Lord of Tresserhorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Tresserhorn) was called "Good Buddy" because he was a 10/4. I believe he was turned in from design as a 9/4 with a different name, but we changed it to a 10/4 in *Alliances* development because we thought 10/4 was funnier. We then changed his name to "Good Buddy."


**Answer to Question #6 – c. [Phelddagrif](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phelddagrif)** 


There was a long-running joke amongst the original playtesters that it was only a matter of time before Richard Garfield designed a flying purple hippo, so the *Alliances* designers (Skaff Elias, Jim Lin, Dave Petty, and Chris Page) decided to design one. [Phelddagrif](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phelddagrif) is an anagram of "Garfield Ph.D." The PR department, at the time, insisted that every time Richard was referenced in an article that he be referred to as "Richard Garfield Ph.D." It made Richard a little uncomfortable, so the other designers used to tease him about it.


**Answer to Question #7 – b. [Spirit of the Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+of+the+Night)** 


The original name for the card was Spirit of the Nightstalker. It was too long, so it got cut during editing down to [Spirit of the Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+of+the+Night).


**Answer to Question #8 – d. [Vhati *il*-Dal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vhati+il-Dal)** 


Michael Ryan and I named all the above characters as creators of The *Weatherlight* Saga. [Vhati *il*-Dal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vhati+il-Dal) was a reference to "Bhogavati," *Tempest*'s codename. In Hindu and Buddhist mythology, Bhogavati is a land of poisoned snakes, and *Tempest* originally had a strong poison theme in it which was removed by development. I forget why we changed the spelling. Eladamri was named after Michael's mother Irma and his stepfather Dale (read it backwards). Orim was originally Oram, and it was just Maro backwards. It was meant as a placeholder name, as Orim started as a more minor crew member, but we just got used to the name and it stuck. We changed it from Oram to Orim to make it a little less obvious where we got it from. Selenia was named after Michael's cat Selena, which itself was named after a character from a role-playing game Michael played in.


**Answer to Question #9 – c. [Karn, Silver Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn%2C+Silver+Golem)** 


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Karn)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=9847)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=9847)
*Vanguard* was a product we made many years ago for play in stores. It's a card that starts outside your deck that grants you an ability for the game and can change your starting hand size and life total. The first batch of cards for *Vanguard* were designed before we knew we were using the characters from The *Weatherlight* Saga cast on them. One of them was a card that animated your artifacts inspired by the *Antiquities* card [Titania's Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titania%27s+Song). We put Karn on the card because it was the only character from The *Weatherlight* Saga that had anything to do with artifacts. Besides being an artifact, he was the caretaker of the Legacy, a collection of artifacts. He didn't really have the power to animate them in the original story, but we liked the *Vanguard* card, so we decided it was close enough. When we went to design Karn in *Urza's Saga*, we gave him his -4/+4 ability to capture his pacifism, but we needed a second ability. His *Vanguard* card had been popular, so we ended up making his activated ability the effect from his *Vanguard* card.


**Answer to Question #10 – c. [Jolrael, Empress of Beasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jolrael%2C+Empress+of+Beasts)** 


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=24673)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=24673)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jolrael%27s+Centaur)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jolrael%27s+Centaur)
After Teferi phased out his isle with experiments of time manipulation, it drew the attention of three wizards—Mangara, Kaervek, and Jolrael. The three ventured to the continent of Jamuraa, which led to a big war between them. This conflict was the main crux of the *Mirage* story.


**Answer to Question #11 – c. Urza** 


Ever since he appeared in the name of two cards in *Alpha*, the audience had been requesting a card for Urza. The problem, at the time, was that Urza was a Planeswalker and we didn't yet represent Planeswalkers on cards. In the story, Urza disguised himself as a blind seer, so we decided this would be a chance for us to get Urza on a card. The problem was that most of the players hadn't read the book, so almost no one knew it was Urza and it didn't have the impact we were hoping it would have. Urza would later show up as a planeswalker card in *Unstable* and a legendary creature (from the past, pre-Planeswalker) in *Modern Horizons*.


**Answer to Question #12 – b. [Atogatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atogatog)** 


[Atogatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atogatog), with a different design, was going to originally appear in *Unglued 2*, but that product was put on hiatus and never got made. That happened late enough in the life of the product though that we had already commissioned art. Flash forward to *Odyssey* development. Randy Buehler told me he was interested in having a cycle of ally color [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog)s in the set. I designed him a cycle of cards and included a design for [Atogatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atogatog) because I knew we already had the art.


**Answer to Question #13 – a. [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath)** 


One of the running jokes during *Legions* design and development was to keep adding abilities to Akroma. Cycling was in the block, so for a while, she had cycling 2.


**Answer to Question #14 – b. [Glissa Sunseeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa+Sunseeker)** 


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Glissa+Sunseeker)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa+Sunseeker)
![The Moons of Mirrodin](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/u8nV8Zw86d.jpg)


Glissa was the main character. Bosh and Slobad were her companions. Memnarch was her antagonist.


**Answer to Question #15 – d. [Isamaru, Hound of Konda](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isamaru%2C+Hound+of+Konda)** 


I was in a meeting where I was told that we couldn't make a vanilla legendary creature that would excite players. I designed Isamaru on the spot to prove them wrong. It then went into the set.


**Answer to Question #16 – a. [Borborygmos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borborygmos)** 


[Borborygmos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borborygmos) means "a rumbling or gurgling sound caused by the movement of gas in the intestines."


**Answer to Question #17 – c. [Norin the Wary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norin+the+Wary)** 


[Norin the Wary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norin+the+Wary) is the oldest. He first appeared on the card [Jade Statue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jade+Statue) in *Alpha*. He would later go on to appear in numerous other sets. Endrek Sahr was next to appear in the flavor text of *Fallen Empires* as the breeder of the thrulls. Jaya Ballard and Saffi Eriksdotter both first appeared in the flavor text of *Ice Age*, Jaya as a task mage and Saffi as the victim of a Lhurgoyf.

Doran was part of an eight-card cycle. There were eight tribes supported in *Lorwyn*, and each got a legendary creature of all the colors the creature type appeared in.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=48591)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=48591)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=49090)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=49090)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=46065)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=46065)

[Olivia Voldaren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Olivia+Voldaren) won the rare poll with the name Count Dracula. The debate that came from this incident made us create a new process where we give somewhat more realistic names to cards before doing the rare poll.
