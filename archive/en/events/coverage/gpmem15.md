GRAND PRIX MEMPHIS 2015
=======================


















GRAND PRIX MEMPHIS 2015
-----------------------




* [DAY 1 COVERAGE](#tabs-0)


DAY 1 COVERAGE



*Fate Reforged* made it's grand entrance into the Standard format in Seville last weekend, promising to open the door to new deck archetypes and reinvigorate the old. Now the Grand Prix circuit has moved across the Atlantic to Memphis, Tennessee where players will look to adapt to the new format and the recent results from Spain, where Blue-Back Control took home the trophy.


Last weekend also saw the rise of decks such as Red-White Aggro, eschewing the blue of earlier Jeskai builds to gain access to premium removal spells such as Chained to the Rocks, and green-based devotion decks, many of which were quick to welcome *Fate Reforged*'s Whisperwood Elemental into their Forest home.


Many of the top pro players in the world have now made their way to Memphis to tackle this new Standard with their own takes on the format. In attendance are: No. 1 Owen Turtenwald, No. 7 William Jensen, No. 9 Jacob Wilson, No. 10 Sam Black, No. 19 Seth Manfield, No. 20 Andrew Cuneo, No. 22 Ben Stark, No. 23 Patrick Chapin, and No. 24 Craig Wescoe.


How will these players approach a format in flux? Will any new *Fate Reforged* cards make their mark on Standard? Tune in at 1 p.m. CST to twitch.tv/magic to find out.
