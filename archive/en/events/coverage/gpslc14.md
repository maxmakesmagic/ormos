NELSON WAS CROWD'S FAVORITE IN SALT LAKE CITY
=============================================




Brandon Nelson took Charge and Warded off his finals opponent, Sam Butarseh, to claim the title at Grand Prix Salt Lake City.

TOP 8 COVERAGE



Brandon Nelson, after so many ninth place misses and years of play, broke through to win Grand Prix Salt Lake City. By defeating Sam Batarseh in the finals, along with Jamie Parke and 17th-ranked Eric Froehlich in the quarterfinals and semifinals respectively, Nelson cemented himself as one of the new vanguard of rising stars.


One of the upcoming stops for Nelson, and everyone else in the star-studded Top 8, will be Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* thanks to the invitations the final eight of every Grand Prix earned. While players like Hall of Fame elect and 13th-ranked Paul Rietzl already secured their bids, those of Chris Woodall, Shady Badran , and finalist Sam Batarseh will use their high finishes for much more.


878 players came to Grand Prix Salt Lake City, taking their last opportunity to play *Magic 2015* at the premier level. Through nine rounds of Sealed, leading to 118 players in six rounds of Draft, the swansong of the format was a familiar tune: Soul of Theros and Soul of Shandalar made their presence known in the battles for undefeated Day 1 records, with the usual troupe of Triplicate Spirits, Sanctified Charge, Spectra Ward, Stoke the Flames, and Inferno Fist demolishing players in every round of Draft. Both finalists used burn spells to clear their way to the end, though it was the powerful white Aura that sealed the deal for winner Nelson.


With Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, and the dual Grand Prix weekend in both Orlando and Shanghai immediately before, on the horizon the time for a new Limited format is here. Join us as we dive into the newest set to make its mark on the game.

DAY 2 COVERAGE



Day 2 of Grand Prix Salt Lake City is underway, with 118 returning for the Sunday showdown of *Magic 2015* Draft. Leading the way are four undefeated players from Saturday: at a record of 8-0-1 Allen Sun, and with records of 9-0 Ian Roberson, 11th-ranked Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* winner Shaun McLaren, and Grand Prix San Diego 2013 winner Nathan Holiday.


However, many more than those four are duking it out today: 2nd-ranked Owen Turtenwald, Christian Calcano, Ben Friedman, Jamie Parke, Pro Tour Hall of Fame elect and 13th-ranked Paul Rietzl, 17th-ranked Eric Froehlich, Neal Oliver, and Limited Information and coverage commentator Marshall Sutcliffe all made their mark in the Sealed portion of the event. 


With six rounds of *Magic 2015* Draft and a Top 8 draft to follow, Day 2 of Grand Prix Salt Lake City will put the final words in the book on another Limited format. Follow along all day to see how the best in the game handle the power of white cards and tap into the best strategies the format has to offer.

DAY 1 COVERAGE



878 players started the day at Grand Prix Salt Lake City, each tapping into the power of six packs of *Magic* 2015 to build a deck. With destiny in their own hands, the tables filled with clashing and battles to whittle down to just the few players who could earn the right to return the next day.


Along the way great stars of *Magic* fell by the wayside: 9th-ranked 2013 Player of the Year Josh Utter-Leyton and 9th-ranked Pro Tour *Gatecrash* winner Tom Martell were banished; Canadian standout Jon Stern was stopped in the ultimate round of the day; and so too was Peach Garden Oath member and 4th-ranked William Jensen.


However, many more carried the torch through for Sunday drafting: 2nd-ranked Owen Turtenwald, Christian Calcano, Ben Friedman, Jamie Parke, Pro Tour Hall of Fame elect and 13th-ranked Paul Rietzl, 17th-ranked Eric Froehlich, Neal Oliver, and Limited Information and coverage commentator Marshall Sutcliffe all made their mark to return. And atop the leaderboard sit four players, three with records of 9-0: Ian Robertson, Grand Prix San Diego 2013 champion and Day 1 King of the Hill Nathan Holiday, and 11th-ranked Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* winner Shaun McLaren. At 8-0-1 Allen Sun sits just a hair's breadth behind.


With two rounds of *Magic* 2015 Draft and a Top 8 draft to follow, Day 2 of Grand Prix Salt Lake City will put the final words in the book on another Limited format. Join us at 9 AM local time to follow along until another Grand Prix champion is crowded.
