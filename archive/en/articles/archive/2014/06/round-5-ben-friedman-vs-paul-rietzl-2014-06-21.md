**The Players**




 This Feature Match features two titans of East Coast *Magic*, duking it out early in the tournament. First up is Ben Friedman from Baltimore. After bursting onto the scene with a Top 8 finish at Grand Prix Orlando in 2012, Friedman proved that he was one of the hot young players to watch by making a second Grand Prix Top 8 in Minneapolis just a few months later. While the 2013-14 season might look like it has been a quiet one for him, with only one Top 8 in Richmond, he has quietly amassed 28 points, putting himself in striking distance of Gold for next year. With the appearance points he would receive for showing up at the Pro Tour in Portland, Friedman needs a Top 4 finish here to lock up his Pro Tour invitations for all of next season.
