![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptchi03/a708.jpg)English was not the language of choice at this match, so don't expect many quotes from the players. I all can do is hope to follow the movements of the cards around the playmat, but that usually tells the story well enough.

Franck and Antoine are two of France's most accomplished players, coming into this event with over 30 Pro Tour points each, although they both admit that number is significantly less now that PT Chicago is over. Both are looking for redemption from bad draft events by winning the big money here in the Standard Masters.

Franck is playing a three-color [Opposition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) deck that splashes black for discard. It is based on the Extended deck he played in Houston, except now the Intuitions are [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation)s. Antoine is playing a typical [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) deck, now updated to include both fetchlands, cycling lands, and [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)s.

### Game 1

Franck had the first play, a turn-2 [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), but Antoine offed it with [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). Franck thought for wayyyy too long before playing a third land and a [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) on his turn, and it, too, was [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed. Franck's turn-4 [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) was countered with [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike), but the flashed-back half resolved. Franck followed it up with a [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd).

Antoine did nothing about the token, did nothing on his own turn, and took the damage from its attack. He then [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)ed Franck's [Birds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds), untapped, and cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) to reset the game.

After the Upheaaval, Canu had to discard a [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and three land. It was easy to see why Antoine was so adamant about keeping Franck's mana creatures off the table.

Franck drew a [Polluted Delta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) on his next turn, got a swamp, and played [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Antoine's hand was revealed to be five land, [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother), and [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval); Franck made him discard the latter. Certainly not much business! Could Franck capitalize?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptchi03/a709.jpg)An Analysis from the graveyard found a [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) to get rid of the [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother), and then Franck played the bomb [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest). Antoine made Franck's life difficult again by topdecking a [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and immediately drawing four cards. Franck put out a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and looked to end the game quickly.

Antoine drew no answer to the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel), and when he realized Franck could pump it enough times to kill him, he conceded.

Franck Canu 1 – Antoine Ruel 0

### Game 2

Olivier Ruel told me that after playtesting this match-up all day, there's no way of knowing how Franck will sideboard. He has so many reactive cards he can bring in, like [Ray of Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation) (vs. [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague)), [Envelop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop), [Static Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Static+Orb), and more discard, that if he brings them all it his deck becomes too low on threats. I imagine Franck knows exactly what he wants to do, exactly which cards he wants to bring in, so the advantage has to go to Franck in this situation.

Antoine started Game 2 by mulliganing a zero-land draw, and kept the six. 

Franck started with a [Birds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds) that was killed via [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), which hurt, because his first four lands were forests. He waited for a window, and got one when Antoine tapped out for [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) on turn 4. Franck played a [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur)—another sideboard card—and Antoine had no way to kill it. He simply played a fifth land and a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and said go.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptchi03/a710.jpg)Now Franck had to see if he would win the race. He drew a Delta and used it to play [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Antoine had to use two [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic)s to stop it, and then took a hit from the Centaur. All of Antoine's pain lands were catching up to him—after flashing back his Analysis, he was down to 8.

[Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) from Franck took out the 'Tog, an attack took Antoine to 2, and Antoine was forced to [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), tapping a [Cephalid Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum). He was alive, although just barely.

After the reset, Franck's [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) was [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike)d, and his Elf was killed by [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague). Antoine held off the first [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest) token with a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), and if he had drawn a second Plague, he could have won the game. As it happened, the Nest overran him.

Game, set, and match to Franck Canu, who will now go on to face Ken Ho in the finals.

**Final Result:** Franck Canu 2 – Antoine Ruel 0
