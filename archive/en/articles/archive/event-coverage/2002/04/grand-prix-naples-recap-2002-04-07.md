![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpnap02/a867.jpg)Pierre Malherbaud is the Champion of Grand Prix Naples! 296 players arrived at the Cittá della Scienza in Naples, Italy for the last European Grand Prix of the *Odyssey*-*Torment* Limited season. After two days of hard fought competition the local nation was squeezed out completely as four Germans, three Frenchman and one Dutchman took the coveted Top 8 places.

And what a Top 8 it was. Iwan Tan could be considered the odd one out as he hadn't had a Grand Prix top 8 within the last year and he still made Top 8 in Grand Prix-Moscow. Pierre Malherbaud managed Top 8 in Grand Prix-London. Christoph Lippert continued a hot streak as this was his third Top 8 in a row. And names like Raphaël Lévy, Olivier Ruel, Patrick Mello, Jelger Wiegersma and Kai Budde are all familiar rounding out a highly accomplished Top 8.

In the end it was Pierre Malherbaud who triumphed, riding his Squirrel-infested triple-Torturer green-black deck to victory against Jelger Wiegersma's green-blue deck in the final.
