**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


Teferi is the best planeswalker printed in a long time. ([Seal Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+Away) is close second.)

[History of Benalia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=History+of+Benalia) attacks other decks from other angles.

[Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk). It did the most work and had the most value this weekend.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Arguel's Blood Fast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arguel%27s+Blood+Fast). It surprised me how much value both sides provided.

**Name:** Ian Plantz


**Age:** 25


**Occupation:** Technical Consultant @ Dell


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Two-time PPTQ Champion.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


GB Constrictor, because I feel it has a great Control and Turbo Fog matchup.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Thrashing Brontodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrashing+Brontodon), because I destroyed a lot of [Gift of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Paradise) and [Search for Azcanta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Azcanta) this weekend. It's also a wall versus red decks.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), as the information and utility versus Control and Combo is great.

**Name:** Corey Burkhart


**Age:** 26


**Occupation:** Game Designer


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


3 GP Top 8's. Member of team Face to Face games. Gold? Platinum? Pro. Who knows.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


UB Midrange. Has the Grixis interaction, but a better mana base. Shout out to former US National Champ Michael Jacob for helping me out with the mana/list.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Censor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Censor). I countered an unreal number of Teferi and Chandras with it. I also cycled into a [Vraska's Contempt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska%27s+Contempt) to an [Angrath, the Flame-Chained](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angrath%2C+the+Flame-Chained) stealing my Scarab God.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce). Shout out to MJ. 1 mana interaction is so key.

**Name:** Arseniy Egorov


**Age:** 29


**Occupation:** *Magic: the Gathering* judge


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


25th Anniversary Pro Tour.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


Grixis Control. Dmitry Butakov was playing the same deck this weekend in Brussels, after the PT. I asked him what he would recommend and he sent me this list. It's good against current meta and has good answers against Turns (Turbo Fog).


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Arguel's Blood Fast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arguel%27s+Blood+Fast) clearly MVP. It helps to stabilize vs Aggro decks (especially with [The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God)) and it gives you tons of fuel vs Control and Combo.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). All matches I sided it in I drew all three and won.
