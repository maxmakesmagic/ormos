![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/334_dossier.jpg)**Name:** Jino Choi


**Born on:** 1979 (Just made the 70s kid cut)


**Job Title and Duties:** Senior Graphic Designer


**Began Working at Wizards:** October 2007


**Previous jobs:** Graphic designer for a toy company, UPS package mangler, salesman for audio speakers out of the back of a sketchy van


**Education:** Associates of Arts Degree in Graphic Design at the Art Institute of Seattle (2002)


**How did you get your job here:** I got the heads up from a couple of friends who were already working at Wizards, and that the company was interested in hiring a designer for their team. I jumped at the opportunity and presented my portfolio, went through a thorough interview, and the rest is history.


**Expansions or projects you've worked on:** Currently working on the design and lettering of the upcoming *[Path of the Planeswalker](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/062509a)*. Recently wrapped up the final design of *Worldwake* and the graphic design of the *Shards of Alara* block all-foil boosters. I also worked on the learn-to-play insert sheet for ***Magic** 2010* core Set and had the opportunity to get some great insight (via one of those nifty two-way mirrors) with the focus group testing on how players used and interpreted the insert.


**Favorite part of the job:** The people! I am lucky to work with some of the most talented people around. The creative energy is always in abundance and I get inspired every day by the amount of quality products my colleagues produce.


**Least favorite part of your job:** Those crazy tight deadlines!


![Apocalypse Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Apocalypse+Hydra)**Thing you've worked on that you're most proud of:** I'd have to say the *Path of the Planeswalker*. I had to really dive into the world of comics and learn quite a bit of that particular genre. There is a lot of work that goes into designing and lettering of each page. The really cool part is getting to put those awesome Planeswalkers of the **Magic** Multiverse to the forefront and get a glimpse of what these characters are all about.


*(Editor's Note: You can see some of Jino's lettering in [The Wild Son](/en/node/629266), a three-part web comic which started today!)*


**Other games I play:** I'll be the first to admit I'm a big video game junkie. I recently got back into **Magic** and re-acquainting myself with the whole deck building thing. The Xbox LIVE Arcade game **Duels of the Planeswalkers** has also been sucking up my gaming time.


**Favorite Magic card:** [Apocalypse Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Apocalypse+Hydra) from *Conflux*. The card art is simply awesome!


**In your spare time:** I've taken a liking to snowboarding and I try to head up during the cold months.


**Something the readers don't know about you:** I'm actually a big southern boy raised in a small suburb outside of Dallas, TX. I love me some good BBQ and Dallas Cowboys football.
