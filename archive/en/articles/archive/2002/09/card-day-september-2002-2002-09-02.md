**Card of the Day - lundi 30 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Weakstone)#### Weakstone


*Antiquities* uncommon.  
The flavor text on Weakstone mentions the "cave of Koilos," a placename that was used again 8 years later in *Apocalypse* for the rare land Caves of Koilos.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 27 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ersatz%20Gnomes)#### Ersatz Gnomes


*Mirage* uncommon.  
Like all other artifact Gnomes, Ersatz Gnomes have retroactively been given the creature type "Gnome."
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 26 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Thrull%20Champion)#### Thrull Champion


*Fallen Empires* uncommon.  
The Thrull Champion is abnormal because he grants his pluses to himself, making him effectively 3/3. Other Lords generally do not grant their own bonuses to themselves.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 25 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=An-Zerrin%20Ruins)#### An-Zerrin Ruins


*Homelands* uncommon.  
An-Zerrin Ruins was the first card that let you choose a creature type, and its existence led to the tweaking of types that goes on to this day.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 24 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Arena%20of%20the%20Ancients)#### Arena of the Ancients


*Legends* rare.  
This cards affects creatures with the type Legend, not all cards from the *Legends* expansion. The card was created as a potential stopgap in case Legends were too prevalent or powerful.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 23 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jareth,%20Leonine%20Titan)#### Jareth, Leonine Titan


*Onslaught* rare.  
Jareth, like the other Pit Fighter Legends, originally cost five of the same color, such as WWWWW. They proved way too strong in one-color decks and unplayable in two-color decks, so they were upped to six mana, three of which were colored.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 20 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ali%20from%20Cairo)#### Ali from Cairo


*Arabian Nights* uncommon.  
How times change. Ali, a 0/1 for four mana, was considered powerful enough to warrant restriction in Type 1 as recently as 1996.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 19 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Earthcraft)#### Earthcraft


*Tempest* rare.  
Combined with the *Odyssey* uncommon Squirrel Nest, Earthcraft can produce infinite tokens in a single turn.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 18 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Copy%20Artifact)#### Copy Artifact

Alpha rare.  
A truly bizarre card, Copy Artifact is considered both an artifact and an enchantment while in play.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 17 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Impulse)#### Impulse


*Visions* common.  
One of the most poorly worded cards ever. The last line of Impulse (about shuffling) is to be ignored and wasn't ever meant to be on the card.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 16 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fluctuator)#### Fluctuator


*Urza's Saga* rare.  
By making all the Urza block cycling cards effectively cycle for 0, Fluctuator enabled some degenerate deck-thinning and was banned from Standard play.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 13 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Taniwha)#### Taniwha


*Mirage* rare.  
The massive 7/7 Taniwha is the only legend ever printed with the phasing ability.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 12 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wandering%20Mage)#### Wandering Mage


*Alliances* rare.  
Wandering Mage was the first card with an ability that benefits other Clerics you control.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 11 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kavu%20Climber)#### Kavu Climber


*Invasion* common.  
Green takes advantage of the card-draw mechanic through "cantrip" creatures like this card and Wall of Blossoms.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 10 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Camouflage)#### Camouflage

Alpha uncommon.  
Camouflage was one of two early cards that allowed creatures to be in play face down. This card's purpose was to make blocking difficult.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 9 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Smother)#### Smother


*Onslaught* uncommon.  
Like Blistering Firecat, this card was also previewed in the *Sideboard* magazine. It kills Wild Mongrel, Nantuko Shade, and Psychatog… sounds good!
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 6 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Blistering%20Firecat)#### Blistering Firecat


*Onslaught* rare.  
The Firecat was previewed in the latest issue of the *Sideboard* magazine… stay tuned for our *Onslaught* previews starting next week.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 5 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Thallid)#### Thallid


*Fallen Empires* common.  
The Thallids were the first creatures to create Saproling Tokens, doing so at the excruciating rate of one every three turns.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 4 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Disenchant)#### Disenchant

Promo card.  
This version of Disenchant was given out as a prize to winners of the Arena league in 1996 and 1997.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 3 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mind%20Ravel)#### Mind Ravel


*Ice Age* common.  
Mind Ravel was "remade" in *Torment* as Unhinge. Unhinge lets you draw the card right away, as opposed to during the next turn's upkeep.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 2 septembre 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Second%20Thoughts)#### Second Thoughts


*Odyssey* common.  
The flavor text on Second Thoughts mentions "farming" in homage to the original white "remove-from-game" instant, Swords to Plowshares.
