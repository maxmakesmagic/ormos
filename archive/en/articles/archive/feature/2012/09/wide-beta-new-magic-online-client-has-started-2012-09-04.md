Since the Sneak Peek, we have made several key changes with more on the way (check out [Ryan's article](/en/articles/archive/going-wide-2012-09-04) for the full scoop). This is your chance to check out the progress we have made and give us your feedback. Use the **Magic Online**
[forums](http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/view/75846/135046/Magic_Online_General) to discuss your favorite feature or make suggestions about what could be better. In addition, we will offer surveys as the Wide Beta progresses which will let you provide feedback directly to the development team. 


Please remember that actions players perform during the Wide Beta will affect your actual **Magic Online** accounts. The interface may be different, but the effects are still permanent as if you were using the current MTGO client, so don't get crazy and start trading all your [Worldfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldfire)s for [Centaur Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Courser)s.
