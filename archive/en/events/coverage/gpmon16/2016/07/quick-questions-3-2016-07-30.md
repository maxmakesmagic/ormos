### Which player would you like to see inducted into the Magic Hall of Fame this year?

**Paul Dean:** Owen Turtenwald. He’s clearly the best player in the world right now.

**Lucas Siow:** Yuuya Watanabe. He’s respected by the top pros as one of the toughest opponents. That’s the sort of player I think should be in the Hall.

**Chris Pikula:** Since I’m not on the ballot this year, I’ll say Osyp Lebedowicz. He’s probably my best friend among those eligible.

**Gerard Fabiano:** Definitely Mark Herberholz. He suffers from having played during an era without video, but he was the best Constructed player in the world for over a year.
