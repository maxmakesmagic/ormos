Diamonds are a girl's best friend, or so the saying goes. But with the release of *Commander* (2014 Edition), Diamonds will become every mage's best friend.


It's no secret to anyone who knows me that I love Commander. I have twelve decks built and ready—some of them aren't even blue. My friends and people around the Wizards offices have taken to calling me the Khan of Value, thanks to Command Tower's own Adam Styborski fitting me with that nickname based on my love of all things that generate at least a two-for-one.


One of the crown jewels of my Commander collection is an Azami deck that's both horribly busted and terribly pretty. At this point, the power level is so high that I rarely ever play it. I mostly take it out, show it off, then put it back and bust out Oloro, Animar, Roon, or any other commander that lets me abuse [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) (such value).


But tucked neatly in that Azami deck is one of the list's quiet MVPs, a little-thought-of *Mirage* gem—both literally and figuratively—that I don't see very often in games due to how old it is. I'm talking, of course, of my precious, [Sky Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sky+Diamond).

The Diamonds, which were  [a cycle in *Mirage*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=%5B%22Mirage%22%5D&name=%5B%22Diamond%22%5D+!%5B%22Lion%22%5D) , are basically the perfect mana rocks for single-colored decks. Both simple and efficient, Diamonds should be more heavily played than they are.


I have a feeling that's about to change.

And while I enjoy the old *Mirage* art, I really love the new art from [Lindsey Look](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Lindsey%20Look%22%5D), which makes the Diamonds look almost Mox-esque, which is fitting in a format where these come down early and do a decent Mox impression. Let's take a look at these gorgeous pieces.
