**Hometown:** Madison, WI


**Occupation:** IT Consultant


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 


2 GP Top 16s


**What deck are you playing and why?**


Sultai Energy, because it's an aggressive deck that draws lots of extra cards, and it's the best replacement I could find for [Cryptbreaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptbreaker). Also it beats up on mono-red.


**What was your best Standard card this weekend and why?**


[Glint-Sleeve Siphoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint-Sleeve+Siphoner), because getting two draw steps is good.


**What was your best draft card this weekend?**


[Territorial Hammerskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Territorial+Hammerskull).


**What would making the National Team mean to you?**


Trip to France sounds nice!

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 


Was birthed by *Magic* goddess Evan Petre


Went 9-0 at Nationals


**What deck are you playing and why?**


Blue-Black Control/sideboard aggro. The Shadow Cabal recommended it and my girl Tiff played Temur, so it was my only option


**What was your best Standard card this weekend and why?**


[Gifted Aetherborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifted+Aetherborn), it's great when my opponents take out removal and it's gifted like me. Also my daddy of the weekend, Jake Tilk, always loses to it.


**What was your best draft card this weekend?**


Skullduggery, it allowed me to douggie on people so I be like my father, Mario Martinez, since he is always styllin'. Mike Soles isn't styllin' though.


**What would making the National Team mean to you?**


I would get a nice Facebook profile pic, and an even nicer accomplishment. In addition, my brother would get to meet Reid Duke, who he literally likes more than me.
