Unveiling the 2007 Auction of the People decks!
-----------------------------------------------


Ladies and gentlemen, the 2007 **Magic** Invitational Auction of the People decks are in my possession! In a few short paragraphs or one short scroll, they will be in your possession, too. For those just tuning in, the challenge was to construct a deck using the Legacy card pool. No problem, huh? The only snag was that you had to jump through another hoop. The deck had to have exactly 26 unique cards, one for each letter of the alphabet. Basic lands didn't count towards this total.


This challenge was much more open-ended than past Auctions. In previous years, you had to build around a certain tribe, or artist, or word. Once you chose a suitable one, you were left with a relatively small pool of cards to work with. Not so here. The letter X had its limitations (there are only six cards beginning with that letter), but every other letter had a ton of options, even, surprisingly, the letter Q.


With the necessary inclusion of so many unique cards, there were a number of viable paths to take in order to make your deck more consistent. You could cover a bunch of letters with redundant cards. If, for example, you wanted a two-mana artifact to fix the mana of your blue-white deck, you could use [Talisman of Progress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Progress), [Azorius Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Signet), [Coldsteel Heart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coldsteel+Heart), and [Prismatic Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens). If you needed four one-mana Elves to ramp you up to your [Call of the Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd)s, you could use [Boreal Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid), [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Fyndhorn Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fyndhorn+Elves), and [Elves of Deep Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elves+of+Deep+Shadow). Another thing many people did with all their unique cards was put them in a toolbox. If you chose to use [Enduring Ideal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal), [Captain Sisay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captain+Sisay), or even [Homing Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Homing+Sliver) as a four-of, you could easily justify the inclusion of a series of situational one-ofs. Last of all, you could come very close to building a deck full of four-ofs if your manabase consisted entirely of non-basic lands. In this case, you have to balance the consistency of your action cards (drawing what you need when you need it) with the consistency of your mana. All of these techniques are represented in the final seventeen. (There are seventeen final decks to ensure that even the last of the sixteen invitationalists has a choice.)


Without further ado, here are the seventeen finalists:


### I See a Blood Moon Rising


Legacy is a format containing every non–[Tolarian Academy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Academy) land ever printed. Some have said that it is defined by the mana bases enable by fetchlands like [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) and the Alpha dual lands like [Underground Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea). One of the interesting things about this "alphabet" format is that you can pack more four-ofs into your deck with the heavy use of non-basic lands. With these things in mind, this deck packs plenty of nonbasic land hate, from [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) and its corresponding Magus, to [Wilderness Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wilderness+Elemental), [Dryad Sophistciate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Sophistciate), and [Skyshroud Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyshroud+Elite), to [Lava Blister](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Blister) and [Uncontrolled Infestation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uncontrolled+Infestation). It rounds out its arsenal of hate with a pair of [Hidden Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Herd)s and a full complement of [Price of Progress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Price+of+Progress). [Canyon Wildcat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Wildcat), [Vug Lizard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vug+Lizard), and [Zodiac Dog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zodiac+Dog) (a.k.a. The Littlest Hobo) become unblockable if you have a [Magus or a Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+or+a+Blood+Moon) and your opponent has a nonbasic land. Soften 'em up with some weenie beats and finish 'em with [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate), [Reckless Abandon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Abandon), or a [Price of Progress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Price+of+Progress).

### Use Your Illusions


The next deck uses a familiar kill mechanism: you play [Illusions of Grandeur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusions+of+Grandeur), you gain 20 life, and then you [Donate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Donate) it to your opponent, who loses 20 life as soon as he or she can no longer pay its cumulative upkeep. You can find the combo with [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) or [Lu Xun, Scholar General](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lu+Xun%2C+Scholar+General), and you can protect it with the usual suspects, your [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will)s and your [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s. If that doesn't work for whatever reason, you have a slew of powerful blue fatties at your disposal, including [Keiga, the Tide Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+the+Tide+Star), [Jodah's Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jodah%27s+Avenger), and [Sun Ce, Young Conqueror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Ce%2C+Young+Conqueror). What makes this deck extra special is that the designer took the alphabet challenge one step further. Each of the 26 unique cards is illustrated by a different artist, and each artist's name begins with a different letter of the alphabet! For simplicity's sake, he counted the first letter in the name as it appears on the card. So, Kaja Foglio is the K, Ittoku is the I, Xu Xiaoming is the X, and Zoltan Boros & Gabor Skikszai is the Z.

### Marching Machines


This deck combines some classic mono-white control elements ([Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), [Disenchant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant)) with an unlikely combo involving [Time Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Bomb) and [Circle of Protection: Artifacts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Artifacts). While you're charging up your [Time Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Bomb), you might as well beat down with it. How? Well, with both [Xenic Poltergeist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenic+Poltergeist) and [Karn, Silver Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn%2C+Silver+Golem) able to turn your artifacts into creatures, you can animate your Bombs and send them into the red zone with cries of, "OMG! He's a walking [Time Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Bomb)!" [Barbed Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed+Wire) keeps your opponent on a clock, [Jester's Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jester%27s+Scepter) and [Aeolipile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeolipile) give you some more tools to control the game, and [Orzhov Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orzhov+Signet) helps to fix and accelerate your mana before (possibly) smashing in for two.

### Celebrational, Puppetational, Invitational


This deck caught my attention because I had to look up [Puppet Strings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppet+Strings) to find out what it does. Turns out it forms a nifty creature-killing combo with [Merieke Ri Berit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merieke+Ri+Berit). That's right there in the Gatherer entry, I swear. In all seriousness, [Puppet Strings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppet+Strings) allows you to tap or untap a creature, which is fine on its own, but is especially good with creatures that don't untap normally (like Merieke or [Reveka, Wizard Savant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveka%2C+Wizard+Savant)) or creatures with excellent tap ablities (the two I mentioned, plus [Ertai, Wizard Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ertai%2C+Wizard+Adept) and [Orim, Samite Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%2C+Samite+Healer)). [Puppet Strings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppet+Strings) can also act like a makeshift [Jayemdae Tome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jayemdae+Tome) when you enchant an opponent's creature with [Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal). The rest of the deck consists of a small [Zur the Enchanter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zur+the+Enchanter) toolbox and a smattering of removal to complement Merieke and company.

### Night of the Living Dead Trees


The goal of this deck is to get one of your enormous monsters into the graveyard and then put it directly into play with one of your reanimation spells. You accomplish the former with [Hapless Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapless+Researcher), [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition), and [Foil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foil), and the latter with [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume), [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate), [Goryo's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance), and [Necromancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necromancy). There is a small toolbox of fatties ([Jedit Ojanen of Efrava](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jedit+Ojanen+of+Efrava), [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), [Living Hive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Hive)) to go along with three each of [Akroma, Angel of Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Fury) and [Kodama of the North Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree). The last two laugh at the best creature removal in the format: [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares).


Reanimator


**(designed by Eric D., a.k.a. Seeker After Chaos)**


### Back in Black


Combining efficient black creatures with, uh, more efficient black creatures, this deck seeks to beat the opponent to a pulp as quickly as possible. Starting with [Carnophage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnophage) and [Sarcomancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomancy), moving up to [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade)s, pump knights, and [Phyrexian Negator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Negator)s, and topping out with the all-mighty [Juzam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juzam+Djinn), this deck has no shortage of paths to pain. [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) keeps the threats coming, [Aether Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Vial) ensures they hit the table, and a small disruption package including [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland), [Rishadan Port](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port), and [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) makes it tough for your opponent to keep up.


Suicide Black

### Survival of the Fattest


The first of the true toolbox decks, this one uses [Survival of the Fittest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest) as both a repeatable tutoring engine and a madness outlet. Discard [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla), [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm), or [Krovikan Horror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krovikan+Horror) (sadly, there can be no Survival-Squee in this format) and go find one of your numerous utility creatures ([Uktabi Orangutan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Orangutan), [Viridian Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Zealot), [Indrik Stomphowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indrik+Stomphowler), etc.) or one of your hasty finishers ([Yavimaya Ants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Ants) or [Timbermare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timbermare)). With all of the cheap beaters and mana elves, you can also finish the game quite quickly with an early [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun).


An Ode to Jamie


**(designed by Sean McKeown)**


### What's a Terravore?


For smashing with. The previous deck was intended to be an homage to Jamie Wakefield, King of the Fatties and noted green advocate. The next deck completes the tribute, in a way, by enabling the famed [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order) into [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) play. There are two main paths to victory here. Either get a fatty on the board quickly (preferably a [Terravore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terravore)) and follow it up with a potentially game-sealing [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon), or turn one of your mana creatures ([Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) or [Fyndhorn Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fyndhorn+Elves)) into board-dominating monsters like [Phantom Nishoba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Nishoba) or the aforementioned [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) by way of [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order).


"Ernham"-Geddon

### Land, Ho!


Who doesn't like land? We need it to play spells, and, in the case of this deck, to kill the opponent. Using [Exploration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exploration) and [Manabond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabond) to fill the board with its whopping 42 lands, this deck wins on the back of "manlands" like [Nantuko Monastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Monastery), [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths), and [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), token producers like [Urza's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Factory), and direct damage from [Barbarian Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Ring)s. You can disrupt the opponent with a full set of both [Rishadan Port](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) and [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland), draw cards with cycling lands and [Horizon Canopy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Canopy), or control creatures to some degree with [Ice Floe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Floe) and [Quicksand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksand). [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) is the key, allowing you to reuse your utility lands and resurrect your manlands should they fall in combat.

### Turn, Turn, Turn


Before there was [Rings of Brighthearth](/en/articles/archive/one-ring-totally-rules-2007-09-12), if you wanted to take infinite turns with [Time Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault) and one other card, you used [Mizzium Transreliquat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Transreliquat). The first trick is that Time Vault comes into play tapped and the Transreliquat doesn't. This lets you get around the fact that must skip a turn to untap the Vault. The second is that the Transreliquat allows you to copy an artifact until end of turn, which allows you once again to dodge [Time Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault)'s untap requirement. The deck uses a full set of [Enlightened Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor)s (and three [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)s) to find the combo pieces and [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), and even [Hanna's Custody](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanna%27s+Custody) to protect it. With four [Enlightened Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor)s enabling another toolbox, the deck features a number of artifacts or enchantments that can win you the game. [Darksteel Reactor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Reactor) is great when you take the rest of the turns in the game and you can use either [Legacy's Allure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legacy%27s+Allure) or [Vedalken Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles) to borrow opposing creatures for as long as takes to beat them down.

### A Rock and a Hard Place


Perhaps the most sadistic of the bunch, this deck is packed to the brim with cards that force your opponent to make painful decisions. Is a [Longhorn Firebeast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longhorn+Firebeast) worth being nugged for 5? Is your spell worth 5 life? How much would you pay to keep [Menacing Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Menacing+Ogre) too small to be truly menacing? Is [Prowling Pangolin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prowling+Pangolin) worth two creatures or [Shivan Wumpus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Wumpus) a land? Should you block the [Ogre Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Marauder)? Heck, should you attack through that [Hissing Miasma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hissing+Miasma)? Best of all, how much can you afford to take if you've already bid life to claim your deck in the auction?

I wanted to call this deck Turbo-Rhythm, but who am I kidding? It's Elves! The deck uses the usual array of mana elves ([Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Fyndhorn Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fyndhorn+Elves), [Priest of Titania](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Titania), and [Quirion Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quirion+Ranger)) to steal a game with a quick [Biorhythm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm) or simply play a fatty like [Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Fist+of+Krosa) and "[Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)" for the win. You can even do it the old fashioned way with [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) itself. [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) ties everything together, giving you access to a number of utility creatures ([Indrik Stomphowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indrik+Stomphowler) and company) as well as the elvish [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun), [Tribal Forcemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribal+Forcemage).

### She Sells Sanctuary


The five Sanctuaries from *Apocalypse* (Ana, Ceta, Dega, Necra, and Raka—hmm, weren't those the names of the Teletubbies?) trigger when you control enemy-coloured permanents. For example, if you control a red or black permanent, you will gain 2 life with [Dega Sanctuary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dega+Sanctuary), but if you control both a red and a black permanent, you will gain 4 life. Why not cover all (or most) of your bases with a gold card, such as the easy-to-play [Transguild Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transguild+Courier) or one of the Nephilim? That's just what this deck does. (What, you thought I wrote all that preamble for nothing?) [Joiner Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joiner+Adept) and [Utopia Sprawl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl) help fix your mana so you can cast your Sanctuaries and other multicoloured spells, spells which conveniently pump up your [Quirion Dryad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quirion+Dryad)s.

### This Is Only a Test


[Martyr of Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martyr+of+Sands) allows you to gain a ton of life. Playing it (or putting it into play) and sacrificing it every turn thanks to [Reya Dawnbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reya+Dawnbringer), [Debtors' Knell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debtors%27+Knell), [Proclamation of Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Proclamation+of+Rebirth), [Lifeline](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifeline), or [Genesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) recursion allows you to gain a ton of tons of life. With all that life, [Test of Endurance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Test+of+Endurance) becomes an excellent win condition. [Zur's Weirding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zur%27s+Weirding) "lock" will often do the trick as well. [Children of Korlis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Children+of+Korlis) and [Kami of False Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+False+Hope) act as pseudo-Martyrs, while [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) and [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) allow you to survive until you can get your life-gain engine going.

### Minotaur, Maxotaur


This deck not only contains a herd of Minotaurs, but it also features our second instance of [Yuan Shao, the Indecisive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yuan+Shao%2C+the+Indecisive) (which would probably be my name if I was a creature from *Portal: Three Kingdoms*). [Anaba Spirit Crafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anaba+Spirit+Crafter), the Minotaur lord, leads the assault alongside the sneaky [Minotaur Illusionist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Illusionist) and the eternal warrior himself, [Tahngarth, Talruum Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tahngarth%2C+Talruum+Hero). [Didgeridoo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Didgeridoo), meanwhile, acts as the poor Minotaur's [Aether Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Vial). [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) and [Fault Line](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fault+Line), powered up with [Gauntlet of Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gauntlet+of+Might), help to finish what your horned minions have started.

### Counter Offensive


Unless you're a staunch Cyclops supporter, one of something might be good, but two is better. That's the logic behind [Doubling Season](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season), friend of [Kavu Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Titan)s and [Whirling Dervish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirling+Dervish)es everywhere. Not only will your Kavus come into play with six +1/+1 counters, putting them in [Force of Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Nature) territory, and not only will your Dervishes gain two counters when they deal damage to an opponent, but your [Forgotten Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Ancient)s become absolutely ridiculous. First of all, they'll get two counters every time a spell is played which is already pretty nutty. Even better, whenever you move counters off of your Ancient, you'll be able to put twice that many counters on one of your creatures. This can get even crazier if you have multiple Ancients in play, since you can move counters from one Ancient to another and then to a third creature, doubling the counters each time. You can also power out a doubly large [Maga, Traitor to Mortals](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maga%2C+Traitor+to+Mortals) if you want to win without the combat phase.

### Name Brand (with Cabal Therapy)


Our final deck features a card near and dear to my heart: [Varchild's War-Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Varchild%27s+War-Riders). There are many neat tricks to pull with all the Survivor tokens you can give to your opponent. One of the best is to use Brand. This spell allows you take control of all the permanents you own, which includes tokens created by permanents you control. This includes the Survivor tokens, the Goblin tokens created by [Hunted Phantasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Phantasm) or [Mogg Infestation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Infestation), creatures you've traded with [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake), [Cultural Exchange](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultural+Exchange), and [Legerdemain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legerdemain), the Ape tokens resulting from [Pongify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify), as well as the Spirit tokens generated by [Forbidden Orchard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Orchard). You take them all back. [Despotic Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Despotic+Scepter) and [Tel-Jilad Stylus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Stylus) add a little "If I can't have 'em, no one can" spoiled-brattery to the equation. There are a few other ways to keep all those 1/1s in check, like [Yamabushi's Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yamabushi%27s+Storm), [Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth), and even [Zuran Spellcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zuran+Spellcaster), as well as some blunter instruments like [Nevinyrral's Disk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nevinyrral%27s+Disk) and [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone).
