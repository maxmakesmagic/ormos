After sets come out, I like to reflect on them. Once we have initial player perceptions and tournament data to go along with the several months of internal post-analysis we do between the time we finish the set and it gets into your hands, I like to go back and read through all the Multiverse comments that I and my coworkers made as the set wound its way through development. What exactly compelled us to make Card X cost what it did? What were we afraid of? What philosophical discussions sprang forth from the development of that set? What cool ideas were cut out and should be reinstated somewhere else? Typically that's all very fascinating. It's amazing how much you don't remember about what you were doing just a year ago.


[![Bash_to_Bits](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/OD/Bash_to_Bits.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Bash%2Bto%2BBits)Sadly, the Multiverse comments for *Tenth Edition* just weren't that interesting. How could they be? After all, we weren't allowed to doctor up any of the individual cards (aside from template refreshes, the discussion of which would be only interesting to the Melvins among you) as we were dealing solely with reprints. Sure, there was some discussion about how good Song of Blood was and that we really shouldn't print it right now (probably something to do with [Mogg War Marshal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+War+Marshal)), which common tapper we should have in the set, and if [Dross Crocodile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Crocodile) and [Mass of Ghouls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+of+Ghouls) were too similar, but in general the Core Set commentary can't hold a candle to the heated debates that go on for expert-level expansions.


To that end, I started digging through the Multiverse comments of cards in Tenth from the set they first appeared in and, lo and behold, I found some fun stuff. My methodology was a bit random—I just started typing in card names until I ended up with ten sets of comments I liked, but I think you'll find them enjoyable. It is interesting to see how the development team for **Magic** has evolved both in terms of people and philosophy.

### [Squee, Goblin Nabob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squee%2C+Goblin+Nabob) (*Mercadian Masques*, developed in 1998)

That's all there is for Squee—a note marking the card as one that will be relevant to Block ("cycle") Constructed.


Is that all anyone had to say about this powerhouse at the time? Veteran Henry Stern assures me that the answer is no. Multiverse used different software at the time, and the "Retired Comments" field for old sets wasn't migrated into the new system. I'm sure someone around here has the original Squee comments on his hard drive, but they aren't available for public consumption.

> WJ 7/16: As a general rule, if something is reasonably strong in combination with a very weak card (such as the instant mentioned above), we should weaken it much more than that playtest might suggest, as when comboed with a decent card that works well with it, the "something" will be much stronger.  
> 
> WJ 7/16: This was completely broken with Varchild's War-Riders. I don't think making it four creatures would have made any difference in that deck. Since Varchild's War-Riders was never a problem card, this suggests to me that you need to radically weaken this Avatar.

What I can deduce from the above conversation is that the Avatars used to be free to play if their conditions were met as opposed to only being 6 cheaper. Another thing I found fascinating was that the card was playtested with [Varchild's War Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Varchild%27s+War+Riders) from *Alliances*, a card that wasn't in Standard, just to see how it worked with any effect that gives your opponents creatures. Currently we try to deal with real environments, not theoretical ones that include cards that we aren't actually thinking about printing, although I can see the value of testing such speculative situations.

> 11/2 ME Very similar to Bone Harvest, and possibly higher power level. The cantrip costing model of plus 2 mana is not always entirely accurate on cards that have intrinsic card advantage or neutrality, since Bone Harvest was a constructed level card, and would you rather draw a random card immediately or possibly put 1 or 2 creatures on top of your deck from your graveyard.

The Invasion dev team called out [Recover](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recover) as promotable—meaning it is a good candidate to show up in a Core Set—and eight years later it comes true.


The comparison to [Bone Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Harvest) is an interesting one—I think current R&D believes [Recover](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recover) to be significantly better than [Bone Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Harvest), as it gives you an extra card—but neither card has ever made much noise in Constructed.

We moved [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All) from uncommon to rare in Tenth because protection is such a complicated ability—especially in combination with "choose a color"—that we didn't want new players encountering it very often. It is interesting to see that the card used to be rare in *Planeshift*.

Good comparison data for this deck type is available from Equilibrium style decks, several of which have been posted to the net in the past.

I'm fascinated by how powerful the development team theorized/determined [Sunken Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunken+Hope) to be at four mana. It does seem like a powerful tool in a creatureless deck full of counterspells, although at five mana it has yet to materialize in high-level decks.

For a long time, R&D had a goal of creating the "UBS"—the Universal Base Set that would be the perfect set of core set cards and would never change. We have since revised our thinking and determined that we *like* changing the contents of the Core Set, so the UBS idea has been abandoned. [Persuasion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion) was made for that theoretical set, and was initially uncommon before a late switch to rare.


Just as we swapped [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All) back to its design rarity in Tenth, we did so with [Persuasion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion), moving it down to uncommon.

It looks to me like [Ancestor's Chosen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestor%27s+Chosen) began life as an "[Advocate](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=advocate&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=Judgment)":


Chosen Advocate  

1WW  

Creature – Cleric  

2/3  

T: Return target card in an opponent's graveyard to his or her hand. You gain 1 life for each card in your graveyard.


It eventually got bigger, and then lost the Advocate ability in lieu of a simple comes-into-play ability. Personally I love the change as I feel the Advocates were chessy, confusing, and not particularly fun to play with or against.

The name "Zandau" above refers to Ixidor, the villain of the Onslaught storyline. He was originally slated to be the blue member of the "Pit Fighter" cycle, and was going to be made into an action figure—an endeavor that never really materialized. Eventually Zandau/Ixidor was given a card outside of the cycle, making room for a different blue Pit Fighter.


My favorite comment is the final one. "Arc" what?

Another potential action figure, Phage began life with a totally different set of abilities than what you're familiar with. "Destroy all Soldiers?" Really? I can't tell if that's top-down design or a bunch of random weirdness. It was Mark Rosewater that came up with the player-killing ability that wound up on the final card, and Paul Barclay that came up with the "you-killing" ability that prevents Phage from being cheated into play. The result was one of the most beloved legends in recent memory.

Here's one from a relatively recent set. I find this record fascinating because it reminds me of all the wacky parasitic stuff that Champions had in it at various times. This card used to either have "Giyan" in its name or subtype ("Giyan" became "[Iname](http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/index.aspx?term=iname&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=All%20sets)") and there were a series of spells that essentially had "soulshift"—if you played a Giyan spell, you could regrow another Giyan spell that was cheaper. This card lost that clause because, according to the pattern, it would only let you regrow 0-mana spells. Cutting that made the card much cleaner and promotable, and was a harbinger of things to come—eventually all the "Giyan spell" text was cut from the set.
