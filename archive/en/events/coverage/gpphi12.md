Nakamura storms back from 0-2 to take GP Philadelphia!

Grand Prix Philadelphia 2012
----------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpphi12/Trophy-shot-002-620.jpg)Hall of Famer Shuhei Nakamura continues to add to his daunting resume, winning his fifth Grand Prix at Philadelphia this weekend. Even more impressive? He started the tournament 0-2 (after three byes) and had absolutely zero margin for error. All he had to do—and exactly what he did—was win 14 straight matches. Easy game.


Shuhei's historic accomplishment was only matched this weekend by the historically strong Top 8. Five Platinum level pros made up the final draft table, including Martin Juza and Lukas Jaklovsky, two Czech Republic players who were looking to continue their country's good fortune a week after countryman Stanislav Cifka won the Pro Tour.


But the weekend definitely belongs to Nakamura and his 14 straight wins.


Congratulations to Shuhei Nakamura, Grand Prix Philadelphia Champion!
