***Magicthegathering.com** is running "best of" content during the holidays, and will return with new content January 4, 2006. This Magic Arcana originally ran February 15, 2005.*


The color green is home to many creature-pumping effects. The flavor of these pump effects is often the literal growth of the creature in question -- the creature becomes giant-sized and is thereby better equipped to stomp things into oblivion.

![Might of Oaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Might+of+Oaks)

In some cases you might actually recognize the **Magic** creature being super-sized, as in the case of *Betrayers of Kamigawa's*  [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth). See below how artist Tsutomu Kawade's art of [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth) was tied to his *Champions* piece, [Dripping-Tongue Zubera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dripping-Tongue+Zubera).

In the art of [Dripping-Tongue Zubera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dripping-Tongue+Zubera), that zubera is surrounded by trees of the Jukai Forest. In [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth), note that the same zubera wears some of those trees *on its head*. That's a big spirit.
