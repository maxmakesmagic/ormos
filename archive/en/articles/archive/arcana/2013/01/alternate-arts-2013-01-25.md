The *Gatecrash* Prerelease is this weekend! And since this Arcana will be on the front page of DailyMTG the whole time, that could mean that the Prerelease is happening *right now*!

This provides us the perfect opportunity to highlight the foil alternate-art cards that are in the guild packs. They're like regular Prerelease cards, except that (just like at the *Return to Ravnica* prerelease) you can play them in your Prerelease decks! Here are all five, juxtaposed with their regular *Gatecrash* versions.
