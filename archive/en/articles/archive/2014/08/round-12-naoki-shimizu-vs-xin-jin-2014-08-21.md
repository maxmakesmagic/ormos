The Mono-Black vs Mono-Blue matchup is one that is being hashed out at a thousand FNM's across the world every week. Both decks pack powerful punches but have a different strategy to take the game. Mono-Blue is, historically unusually, the aggressor in this matchup, hoping to punch through with efficient creatures and utilise the powerful God Thassa and her Bident to overwhelm the Black player with relentless card advantage. 


Mono-Black has some flexibility in its game plan, but generally aims to keep the Blue deck's devotion count to a reasonable level before going 'over the top' with its hugely powerful creatures. An active discard and disruption suite for Black keeps things interesting, but if that fails to materialise, as happened in this match, Mono-Blue can threaten to outpace the Black deck's slower pace.





*Jin tries to puzzle his way through an early Thassa.*
