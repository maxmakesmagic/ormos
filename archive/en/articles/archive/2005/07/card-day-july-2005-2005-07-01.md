**Card of the Day - vendredi 29 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Crimson%20Manticore)#### Crimson Manticore


*Legends* rare. *Legends* was the first expansion to feature this type of ability, which R&D calls "Range-Strike." Early on this ability appeared in red and white, but later the ability would be seen much more strongly as strictly white. One reason for this is that the threat of range-strike discourages hand-to-hand combat, which is the opposite of red's philosophy. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 28 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Razormane%20Masticore)#### Razormane Masticore


*Fifth Dawn* rare. Though "Manticore" is a well-established type of fantasy creature, "Masticores" are unique to **Magic**. When the first Masticore was named, the idea was to play on the word "masticate", which means to grind or crush with one's teeth. Note that the art for both Masticores features prominent toothy goodness. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 27 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Coretapper)#### Coretapper


*Darksteel* uncommon. During *Mirrodin's* design process it was decided that the set had too much going on thematically, and a fairly major theme was removed so that it could be used in a later set more centrally. This card is a holdover from that early theme. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 26 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mirrodin's%20Core)#### Mirrodin's Core


*Darksteel* uncommon. One of the secrets of Mirrodin that Glissa Sunseeker learns is that the world is hollow. Contained within that mysterious center is an inner sun of pure mana, depicted in the art for this card. Note that this card's art also features part of the great Mycosynth Lattice. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 25 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Masticore)#### Masticore


*Urza's Destiny* rare. Masticore was so good it was later featured in the art of Deep Analysis being dissected. The flavor text explained it all: “The specimen seems to be broken.”
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 22 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Megrim)#### Megrim


*Eighth Edition* uncommon. Though it's quite obscure, "Megrim" is actually a real word. Derived from Middle English, it's an alternate word for "Migraine". In **Magic** flavor, cards in hand are like spells in a wizard's mind, so discard spells are often flavored as magic that traumatizes the mind. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 21 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Orcish%20Artillery)#### Orcish Artillery

 Alpha uncommon. One of the cards left to have made every core set from Alpha to *Ninth Edition*, the Alpha version of this card was misprinted with the incorrect casting cost of just ![1 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif)![Red Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/red_mana.gif)! 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 20 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goblin%20King)#### Goblin King


*Ninth Edition* rare. One of the most non-intuitive parts of the core set has always been that the creature lords didn't share the creature type of their minions. With *Ninth Edition*, all the lords have been changed to match their minions, but only the lords that made it into the set -- sorry, Lord of Atlantis!
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 19 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Circle%20of%20Protection:%20Red)#### Circle of Protection:

Red Alpha common. Once *Ninth Edition* hits stores, of the five circles of protection, only COP: Red will have appeared in every core set! (The circles against white, blue and green will not be in *Ninth Edition*, and COP: Black was inadvertently left out of Alpha.) 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 18 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Elvish%20Piper)#### Elvish Piper


*Urza's Destiny* rare. This very popular card was inspired by the *Unglued* card Timmy, Power Gamer. "*Un*" sets are often used for experimental design ideas and cards that maybe couldn't be done in tournament legal sets, but in this case the version that made it to "real" **Magic** is surprisingly close to the original. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 15 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Metallic%20Sliver)#### Metallic Sliver


*Tempest* common. The intention had been to name this card "Silver Sliver" as a play on the letters in Sliver. However, when the art came back the Sliver shown wasn't silver enough for that name, so it was changed to Metallic Sliver. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 14 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gallantry)#### Gallantry


*Tempest* uncommon. The art and flavor text of this card depict a scene from the Weatherlight Saga where Hanna saves Mirri from an Unstable Shapeshifter. If you look closely, you can actually see the shadow of the Shapeshifter as well.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 13 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dream%20Halls)#### Dream Halls


*Stronghold*  rare. In the Weatherlight Saga, villain Volrath uses this location to store his memories. In this card's art, each hanging object represents a different memory from his past. Two that can be made out are Volrath with his step-brother Gerard, as well as a scene with Selenia, Dark Angel. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 12 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rout)#### Rout


*Invasion* rare. See that castle burning in the background? That's Capashen Manor, Gerrard's family home, that's being razed. Since Yawgmoth knew that Gerrard was part of Urza's plan to defeat him, Gerrard's home of Benalia was one of the first to fall in the invasion.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 11 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Raving%20Oni-Slave)#### Raving Oni-Slave


*Saviors of Kamigawa* common. While the merits of this card in draft were the subject of considerable debate at Pro Tour London this weekend, the original version would never have had doubters. During design, this creature had the same stats and casting cost, but only took one life coming and going! (Yeah, that turned out to be too good.)
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 8 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Crumbling%20Sanctuary)#### Crumbling Sanctuary


*Mercadian Masques* rare. This card was originally called "Battletech World" in design as it forces the game to mimic the *Battletech TCG* winning condition (decking the opponent).
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 7 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goblin%20Recruiter)#### Goblin Recruiter


*Visions* uncommon. This future tournament star was first printed in *Visions*. However, players were able to see it four months early thanks to the Multiverse gift set, released in November 1996. The set included non-English boosters as well as two “preview packs” of *Visions*. (25 different *Visions* cards could appear in these special packs.)
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 6 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Scent%20of%20Cinder)#### Scent of Cinder


*Urza’s Destiny* common. Occasionally promotional versions of cards are released with alternate art. If you purchased *Duelist #39*, you got a version with special art by Carl Critchlow. (Click here to see the promo Scent of Cinder, and note that collector number, 96a/143!) 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 5 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Breeding%20Pit)#### Breeding Pit


*Fallen Empires* uncommon. The Alpha version of Cyclopean Tomb is the most famous card for being printed without a mana cost, but it's not the only one. When Breeding Pit appeared in Italian *Fifth Edition* as Abisso Prolifico (click to see), it also had no casting cost. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 1 juillet 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Savage%20Beating)#### Savage Beating


*Darksteel*  rare. Though it’s a rare occurrence (not counting *Un*  sets), occasionally Wizards prints **Magic**  cards with titles referencing game slang. Sometimes, however, it occurs by coincidence. Miser’s Cage from *Mirage* wasn’t named to reference the wildly popular term “mise” but Tek (from *Invasion*) was an intentional nod to the commonly used slang for deck improvements. In the case of Savage Beating, the reference was no accident.
