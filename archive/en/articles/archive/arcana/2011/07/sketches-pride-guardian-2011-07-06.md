Welcome back to another edition of Sketches! Today we're looking at a new entry in the core set: a leonin defender named Pride Guardian!


### Artist Portfolio


Artist [Chris Rahn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Chris+Rahn%22%5D) has illustrated forty-six **Magic** cards, although that number's going to go up once ***Magic** 2012* comes out.


### Art Description


The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions Chris was given for Pride Guardian:



> 
> Color: White creature
> 
> 
> Location: Savannah area, in front of a gate or large ornate door of a shrine or chapel.
> 
> 
> Action: Show a leonin (lion humanoid) warrior in a defensive/guarding pose. His job is to prevent any unwanted entry into this sacred place. He wears light ceremonial garb, perhaps some combination of leather and linen (feels ceremonial in detail, but he can still fight in it) and wields a quarterstaff that is carved or adorned in a ceremonial fashion as well.
> 
> 
> Focus: The leonin monk
> 
> 
> Mood: A religious figure who could deflect any of your attacks 
> 
> 
> 


### Sketches


With that art description to work with, Chris submitted a sketch to the **Magic** creative team:

The creative team liked it, especially the hint of some sort of magic face paint on the forehead, so they gave Chris the go-ahead.


### Final Art

### Finished Card


Here's the final card as you'll see it in ***Magic** 2012* booster packs:
