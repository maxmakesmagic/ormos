Imagination is one of those nebulous things that is hard to pin down in art. Often, artists represent imagination in ways that are unusual or, well, awesome ways. In today's arcana we look at the blue Archetype:  [Archetype of Imagination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=+Archetype+of+Imagination). Where, in the art description, the creative team gives Robbie Trevino license to "add some awesomeness."

While Robbie Trevino joined the **Magic** artist line up with the *Theros* block, he did one card for *Commander* (2013 Edition), do you know what it was?
