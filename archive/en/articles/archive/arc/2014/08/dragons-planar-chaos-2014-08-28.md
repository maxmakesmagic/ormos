Prior to the release of *Magic: The Gathering—Commander*, there were few wedge-colored legendary creatures. So few, in fact, that there were but six standard bearers of the wedges. Excepting [Doran, the Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower), these five legends of the wedges were all found in *Planar Chaos* as the alternative-history versions of three-color dragon legends *(Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly called them Elder Dragons. They are not, though they are eldar dragons in the simple English sense of the phrase)*. Little is known about these five mighty dragons that have headlined many a Commander deck over the years, and they remain shrouded in mystery. However, we can shed a little light on them through the art descriptions that gave them birth.


First, each dragon had the same note in its description that tells us what we’re working with:


***Notes:** This dragon should look sentient, like it has a personality and thinks for itself (unlike our normal, predatory red dragons).* 


As for the rest of the description? Read on.


Numot, the Devastator


**Color:** Red primarily, also blue and white


**Location:** sky


**Action:** Show the elder dragon Numot—a legendary, ancient, sentient creature. Numot’s scales are a rich orange-red, and he should seem passionate, engaged, dynamic.


**Focus:** the dragon legend


**Mood:** Vibrant, charismatic, powerful

Teneb, the Harvester


**Color:** Black primarily, also green and white


**Location:** sky


**Action:** Show the elder dragon Teneb—a legendary, ancient, sentient creature. Teneb has dusky, dark scales and a paler underbelly that almost seems to have algae growth on it. This dragon should seem like a weary schemer.


**Focus:** the dragon legend


**Mood:** Brooding, bitter, a little sleepy

Vorosh, the Hunter


**Color:** Green primarily, also blue and black


**Location:** sky


**Action:** Show the elder dragon Vorosh—a legendary, ancient, sentient creature. Vorosh has scales that are the color of the darkest storms and waters: dark greens and blues. He is the strongest and largest among these elder dragons.


**Focus:** the dragon legend


**Mood:** Roiling and ferocious, all muscle

**Focus:** the dragon legend


**Mood:** Fluid and meditative
