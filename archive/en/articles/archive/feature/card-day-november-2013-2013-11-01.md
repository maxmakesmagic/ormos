Card of the Day - November, 2013

By Mike McArtor




 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 









![Free-Range Chicken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Free-Range+Chicken)**[Free-Range Chicken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Free-Range+Chicken)** – *Unglued*. According to Mark Rosewater's feature article, "[Get It?](/en/articles/archive/get-it-2004-08-16-0)," "The chicken in the art of [Free-Range Chicken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Free-Range+Chicken) is just about to swing on a vine like Tarzan. The artist was trying to show that it was a wild jungle chicken." Mark has a lot more *Unglued* trivia, like ninety-nine more, in that article. 
 


![Anvilwrought Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Anvilwrought+Raptor)**[Anvilwrought Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anvilwrought+Raptor)** – *Theros*. Thanks to *[Jurassic Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_%28novel%29)*, the word "raptor" is pretty frequently used to mean [Velociraptor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velociraptor) but its older meaning is "[bird of prey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey)." It got that name from the biological order [Raptores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptores), which has since been split into several other orders. 
 


![Bronzebeak Moa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bronzebeak+Moa)**[Bronzebeak Moa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronzebeak+Moa)** – *Dragon's Maze*. Moa were [flightless birds in New Zealand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa) that largely (or completely) went extinct by around 1400 CE. Our armored Selesnyans here aren't the first moa immortalized on a **Magic** card, though; that honor goes to [Hunting Moa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=15219), from *Urza's Destiny*. 
 


![Raven Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Raven+Familiar)**[Raven Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raven+Familiar)** – *Commander* (2013 Edition). There are  [eighty-one Birds in blue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Bird%22%5D&color=+%5BU%5D), [six of which let you look at cards on top of your library](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Bird%22%5D&color=+%5BU%5D&text=+%5Blook%5D+%5Bcards%5D+%5Blibrary%5D). But only our little familiar here lets us actually put one of them in hand. Thanks buddy! 
 


![Baleful Strix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Baleful+Strix)**[Baleful Strix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Strix)** – *Commander* (2013 Edition). Here's a fun bit of trivia for you: [Baleful Strix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Strix) is a reprint from another set, but despite that it has never been legal in Standard. How is that possible? Because it was originally printed in another ancillary product, in this case *Planechase* (2012 Edition). Test your knowledge of other Bird trivia in [this fun Arcana from last Friday](/en/articles/archive/quiz-birds-magic-2013-11-22)! 
 


![The Cheese Stands Alone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=The+Cheese+Stands+Alone)**[The Cheese Stands Alone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Cheese+Stands+Alone)** – *Unglued*. In *Future Sight*, this was remade for black-bordered **Magic** as [Barren Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Glory). But it *almost* made it into regular **Magic** for *Eighth Edition*. Almost. You see, for **Magic**'s 10th anniversary, Wizards decided to reprint in the core set at least one card from every set published to that point. Every. Set. That included sets like *Portal* but couldn't include silver-bordered *Unglued*. Mark Rosewater explains why [in this article](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/good-core-2003-07-07). 
 


![Blue Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blue+Sun%27s+Zenith)**[Blue Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blue+Sun%27s+Zenith)** – *Commander* (2013 Edition). The blue sun in this card's name refers to one of the five "suns" of the plane of Mirrodin (which is now New Phyrexia, which still has the suns). In case you aren't familiar with it, the plane is orbited by five small satellites of pure mana (its suns), one for each of the five mana colors. These orbits are irregular, so it’s possible for any number of the suns, from zero to all five, to be overhead at any given place or time on the world. 
 


![Sealock Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sealock+Monster)**[Sealock Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sealock+Monster)** – *Theros*. That first ability of [Sealock Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sealock+Monster) has appeared on [twenty-eight creatures](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5Bunless%5D+%5Bdefending%5D+%5Bplayer%5D+%5Bcontrols%5D+%5BIsland%5D) in **Magic**'s history, only *most* of which were sea creatures (looking at you, [Zhou Yu, Chief Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zhou+Yu%2C+Chief+Commander)). The ability is half of what was [flavorfully](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/27) called the "[landhome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5Bunless%5D+%5Bdefending%5D+%5Bplayer%5D+%5Bcontrols%5D+%5Bcontrol%5D+%5Bno%5D+%5Bsacrifice%5D%20)" mechanic (or in blue's specific case, "islandhome"). 
 


![Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Breeding+Pool)**[Breeding Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool)** – *Gatecrash*. Despite the Simic Conclave's continued use of these breeding pools, it remains dedicated to its new Holdfast Principle. In short, the principle "advises guild members never to stray so far from nature that they become 'adrift'—a veiled warning against the excesses and ambitions of the guild's previous iteration." That previous iteration resulted in the highly destructive [Experiment Kraj](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+Kraj), which turned public opinion against the Simic and nearly broke the guild. 
 


![Keepsake Gorgon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Keepsake+Gorgon)**[Keepsake Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keepsake+Gorgon)** – *Theros*. Obviously, all the myths and stories out of Ancient Greece are relatively old, but evidence suggests the myth of the gorgon was ancient even in [Hellenistic times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period). Reliable interpretations of the myth go back to the fifteenth century BCE, with outlier estimates pushing back *millennia*. In **Magic**, this Standard season has been [really good for Gorgon tribal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Gorgon%22%5D&format=+%5B%22Standard%22%5D), but the subtype reaches back nearly to the beginning of the game, being [introduced in Legends](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1448). 
 


![Etched Monstrosity ](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Etched+Monstrosity+)**[Etched Monstrosity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Monstrosity)** – *New Phyrexia*. This is the third in a line of [Etched artifact creatures](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&name=+%5Betched%5D&type=+%5B%22Artifact%22%5D+%5B%22Creature%22%5D) on Mirrodin, showing a progression on that plane from one of relative peace, to one of outright war, to one that is compleat. These creatures share other ties as well, such as the subtle mechanical connection each has to the five colors of mana (and, thus, the five suns of Mirrodin). 
 


![Hythonia the Cruel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hythonia+the+Cruel)**[Hythonia the Cruel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hythonia+the+Cruel)** – *Theros*. If you'd like to put together [a Gorgon tribal deck](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/monstrosity-three-acts-2013-11-12), and really benefit from Hythonia's monstrosity ability (as well as that of the smaller [Keepsake Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keepsake+Gorgon)), you'll be happy to know that as of *Theros* there are  [twelve Gorgons in **Magic**](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Gorgon%22%5D). There are also a couple of [noncreature "Gorgon" cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&name=+%5B%22Gorgon%22%5D&type=+!%5B%22Creature%22%5D), as well Gorgon-themed cards like [Gaze of Granite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+Granite), [Killing Glare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Killing+Glare), [Treasured Find](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasured+Find), and (of course) [Vraska the Unseen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska+the+Unseen). 
 


![Colossus of Akros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Colossus+of+Akros)**[Colossus of Akros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Colossus+of+Akros)** – *Theros*. As a creature without flying, our big Golem here is susceptible to being hit with an [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake). No matter how much mana gets pumped into that X spell, though, the Colossus's indestructible will keep it around. Why mention such a basic rules interaction? Well, surviving that huge [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) spell is a lot better than what happened to the Colossus's [real-world inspiration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_of_Rhodes), which *was* brought low by an earthquake in 226 BCE (fifty-six years after its completion). 
 


![Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fleecemane+Lion)**[Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion)** – *Theros*. As you might have guessed, yes, Fleecemane is indeed a top-down design based on the [Nemean Lion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemean_Lion). Much of the fun of reading Multiverse developer notes comes from finding little gems of levity in them. In this case, the final note for [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) states "Erik likes GW 3/3s. :)" The Lion didn't start off as a 3/3 for two, though. Multiverse reveals that its casting cost (and monstrosity cost) were the last two aspects of the card finalized, as noted by aforementioned lead developer [Erik Lauer](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=Erik%20Lauer). 
 


![Shipbreaker Kraken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shipbreaker+Kraken)**[Shipbreaker Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipbreaker+Kraken)** – *Theros*. **Release the Kraken**... to lock down opponents' creatures! There are lots of ways to tap one or more creatures in **Magic** and prevent them from untapping, usually until their controllers' next untap step. [I mean, lots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&text=+%5Btap%5D+%5Buntap%5D+%5Bcreature%5D%7C%5Bdon%27t%5D%7C%5Bdoesn%27t%5D). [Dungeon Geists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dungeon+Geists) and [Tidebinder Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage) are the first creatures to lock down others like this when they enter the battlefield, but the Kraken is the first to have that ability affect multiple creatures. 
 


![Winged Coatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Winged+Coatl)**[Winged Coatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winged+Coatl)** – *Commander* (2013 Edition). While it perhaps doesn't carry the same power as "poison arrow" in translation, the word "coatl" comes to us from the Nahuatl (one of the major Aztec languages) word for "snake." The Aztec coatl didn't have wings (being an ordinary snake) like the Alara one does, but *Quetzal*coatl did! In 1976, the **Dungeons & Dragons** 
**Monster Manual** included the winged-snake version (spelt "couatl" there), which has been a part of coatl lore ever since. 
 


![Nemesis of Mortals ](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nemesis+of+Mortals+)**[Nemesis of Mortals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis+of+Mortals)** – *Theros*. There are [thirteen Snakes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Snake%22%5D&power=+%3E%3d%5B3%5D&tough=+%3E%3d%5B3%5D) with power and toughness 3+ in **Magic**, and three of them are from *Theros*. Of all Snakes, [Nemesis of Mortals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis+of+Mortals) is the largest. The inspiration for this enormous serpent comes from [Ladon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladon_%28mythology%29), a myth from the Archaic Greek period (c. 800–480 BCE). The stories about Ladon conflict a bit, but the one thing they agree on is that Ladon coiled around a tree bearing golden apples that granted immortality, acting as a sleepless guardian. 
 


![Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)**[Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)** – *Commander* (2013 Edition). The orochi of Kamigawa are four-armed anthropomorphic snakes divided into three tribes. The Sakura tribe is connected with orochi shamanism and spiritualism. Here on Earth, "orochi" is a shortened form of [Yamata no Orochi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamata_no_Orochi), or "eight-headed giant snake" or "eight-headed dragon." 
 


![Nessian Asp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nessian+Asp)**[Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp)** – *Theros*. As if being a huge snake wasn't enough by itself, the [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) is also polycephalic (i.e., it has more than one head). Polycephalic creatures are not uncommon in world mythology, and Ancient Greek mythology has [a number of examples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycephaly#Greek_mythology). For a humorous look at the [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) and a discussion about its multiple heads, check out LoadingReadyRun's video,  ["The Trial."](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/269) 



![Ophiomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ophiomancer)**[Ophiomancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ophiomancer)** – *Commander* (2013 Edition). [Ophiomancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ophiomancer) is not the first time we've seen "Ophi–" on a **Magic** card. Indeed, the first was *Weatherlight*'s [Ophidian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ophidian) (a fancy New Latin word that means "snake"). If you're interested in brewing a snaky deck, you'll be happy to know there are currently [sixty-four Snakes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5B%22Creature%22%5D&subtype=+%5B%22Snake%22%5D) ([four with deathtouch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5B%22Creature%22%5D&subtype=+%5B%22Snake%22%5D&text=+%5Bdeathtouch%5D)), [five noncreature Snake cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&name=+%5BSnake%5D&type=+!%5B%22Creature%22%5D), and a few [thematically](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=thematically)[appropriate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=appropriate+) [cards](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=cards) as well. 
 
![Curse of Predation](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/e1GfMgVYzQ_EN.jpg)  
Curse of Predation – *Commander* (2013 Edition). From the [*Commander* (2013 Edition) Release Notes](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/270) : 



> 
>  A Curse spell targets the player it will enchant like any other Aura spell, and a Curse stays on the battlefield like any other Aura…. The ability won't trigger when a creature attacks a Planeswalker controlled by the enchanted player.
