It's no secret, I'm a fan of our judges. I love meeting judges whenever I travel to the Pro Tour. With judges around the world helping to oversee and facilitate a fun and fair competitive **Magic** scene there are plenty more to meet! 

 Most people see them as the referees of the game, which is certainly true, but it's far from the full picture. There is a very vibrant judge community to oversee game play, facilitate events, teach new players, and generally help the **Magic** community continue to grow and be more awesome! 

If you're interested in learning about becoming a judge, here are a few useful links for you:

* [Official Judge Resource](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=judge/welcome) - Start here and read about the program.
* [How to Become a Certified Judge](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=judge/becoming/how) - A great introduction about how to become a certified judge.
* [List of Regional Coordinators](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=judge/resources/coords) - As the judge community has grown, so has the infrastructure. Not sure who to contact? Reach out to your nearest regional coordinator and he or she will be able to help.
* [Become a Judge](http://wiki.magicjudges.org/en/w/Become_a_judge) - The judge community also maintains an [unofficial wiki](http://wiki.magicjudges.org/en/w/Main_Page) as a reference tool, and it has a number of useful articles. This is just one of them.

Now, let's take a look at these new promos!

 First up is [Genesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) in a new frame. It was originally released in *Judgment*, which used old card frames and even included a small tombstone next to the name to indicate it had abilities in the graveyard. This new printing does not use the tombstone and is just a sexy foil.

 Next up is a new [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) with new art and flavor text. Vindicate was originally printed in *Apocalypse* and has provided many an Orzhov with an effective removal against anything they might face on the board.

 And here's a closer look at this new art by [Karla Ortiz](http://www.karlaortizart.com/) (whom you might remember from *Dragon's Maze*'s [Mending Touch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mending+Touch) and [Teysa, Envoy of Ghosts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teysa%2C+Envoy+of+Ghosts)).
