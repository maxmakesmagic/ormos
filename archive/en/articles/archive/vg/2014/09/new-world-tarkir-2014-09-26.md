Today's the big day. *Khans of Tarkir*is now officially released, and Standard has transformed because of it. What sort of impact will the new cards—along with the rotation of *Return to Ravnica*block and *Magic 2014—*have on the Standard format?


Before we get to that...

In this week's episode of Spellslingers, Sean "Day[9]" Plott battles with Michelle "Esper" Roberson of Frag Dolls fame. Will Michelle's previous *Magic* experience give her the upper hand against Sean even with a deck out of her comfort zone, or will Sean be able to overcome her flurry of fast spells?


You can watch the episode in its entirety below!
