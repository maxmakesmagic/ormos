 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






With the “Your Own Set of Rules” auction and the MQ test of Friday night out of the way, Saturday meant it was time to play **Magic**—almost. Players were broken up into 4-person pods to participate in a 4-way Solomon draft.

### Rules:

Players will compete in 4-person pods during this format. Players will be randomly seated in their pods (Seats 1-4). A short review period within each pod will be allowed in order to look through the draft pool. Each pods' card pool will consist of 200 cards from *Urza's Saga* forward (One booster pack of each set (14) from *Urza's Saga* on, with 10 cards removed pre-draft by tournament staff). After the cards have been reviewed they will be shuffled.

There will be 8 rounds of drafting as follows:

Divide / Draft-1st / Draft-2nd / Draft-3rd  
 Round 1 / p1 / p2 / p3 / p4  
 Round 2 / p2 / p3 / p4 / p1  
 Round 3 / p3 / p4 / p1 / p2  
 Round 4 / p4 / p1 / p2 / p3  
 Round 5 / p4 / p3 / p2 / p1  
 Round 6 / p3 / p2 / p1 / p4  
 Round 7 / p2 / p1 / p4 / p3  
 Round 8 / p1 / p4 / p3 / p2

Each round the divider will be given 25 cards to divide into 4 face-up stacks. Like 1-on-1 Solomon the divider in each round will get the final stack remaining. Unlike regular Solomon, each stack MUST CONTAIN at least 4 cards.

After basic land is added, 40-card minimum decks will be used, with the remaining drafted cards making up each players' sideboard. Each player will play the other three players in his pod in a best of three games match.
