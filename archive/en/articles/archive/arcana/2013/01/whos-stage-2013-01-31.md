Let's talk about [Thespian's Stage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thespian%27s+Stage). As you may already know, "thespian" is a highfalutin' word for "actor," and the card shows two actors, well, acting:

Now, because this is Arcana, you may have already guessed that the actors are significant. In fact, they're acting out an important moment from the history of Ravnica. Let's look closer!

| 89092 | Agrus Kos, Wojek Veteran |

It's [Szadek, Lord of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=89092) and [Agrus Kos, Wojek Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agrus+Kos%2C+Wojek+Veteran), from the original *Ravnica* block! And they're fighting, which means this is probably the moment when Agrus Kos arrests Szadek, breaking the Guildpact!


You can see what it's like to watch this play in [the Uncharter Realms article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/230) that previewed [Thespian's Stage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thespian%27s+Stage). And you can read the whole story of the original *Ravnica* Cycle in eBook form. More information is [right here](/en/articles/archive/magic-gathering-ebooks-2012-09-13).
