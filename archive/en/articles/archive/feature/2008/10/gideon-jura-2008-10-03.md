*Gideon Jura is a planeswalker who wields white magic. Unlike most planeswalkers, Gideon doesn’t hesitate to enter combat. He also practices hieromancy, the magic of holy justice.*


Gideon wields a sural, a three-bladed, whiplike weapon that also serves as a focus for his spellcasting. His strong morals and sense of duty led him to serve as an agent for the Order of Heliud, an organization that sought to bring law to the plane of Regatha, adopted home of the pyromancer Chandra Nalaar. Chandra’s home, the fire monastery called Keral Keep, became an obstacle to the Order of Heliud’s goals, and the Order’s leader, Walbert, needed Chandra out of the way. He sent Gideon to intercept her on the plane of Kephalai, where Chandra was attempting to steal—for a second time—the so-called scroll of Ugin, which contains not only a powerful fire spell but the map to the Eye of Ugin, a hidden chamber on the far-away plane of Zendikar. 


On Kephalai, Gideon apprehended Chandra and delivered her to the authorities there, but she escaped. He tracked her to the dark plane of Diraden, where the two planeswalkers became allies in order to escape the predations of the plane’s ruler, the vampire Velrav. Only on returning to Regatha did Chandra learn that Gideon served the Order of Heliud, and that she would have to surrender herself to Walbert to prevent Keral Keep from being destroyed. With Gideon’s help, however, Chandra survived Walbert’s persecution and gave Gideon reason to question the Order’s true motives. Then she departed in search of the Eye of Ugin. 


After some soul-searching, Gideon decided to follow Chandra to Zendikar, believing he could help her stay alive on the treacherous, unpredictable plane. By the time he arrived there, however, he found Chandra gone and Zendikar under siege. The ancient Eldrazi have been released from their imprisonment, and Gideon must do what he can to protect Zendikar’s denizens—and himself.
