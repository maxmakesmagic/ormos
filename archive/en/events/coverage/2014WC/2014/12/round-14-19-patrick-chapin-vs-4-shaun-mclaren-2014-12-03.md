This was it. The final round in the tournament. Three slots in the Top 4 had already been decided, but four players were all still in the running for the fourth and final slot.


In this particular corner was fourth-ranked Shaun McLaren, captain of the Canadian National team and one of the few hopefuls that could still capture both crowns.


But to do so he had to get through Hall of Famer and nineteenth-ranked Patrick Chapin, who had already locked up a berth in the Top 4 and was now playing for seeding and to help block for his friend and teammate William Jensen.


It wasn't quite the highest of stakes—those would come Sunday—but it was certainly the level just below that. The medium highest stakes, if you will.




*For Chapin, a win meant pole position on the Sunday stage. For McLaren, a win meant an outside chance at Top 4 if things went his way.*
