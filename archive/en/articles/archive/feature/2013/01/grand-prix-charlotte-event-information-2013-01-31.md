**Tournament Structure** 


* Grand Prix Charlotte will be run over two days using modified Swiss-style rounds of 50 minutes each. The number of rounds on Day 1 will be determined based on the number of players registered, Players will be paired randomly against players with similar win-loss records, with match points accumulating throughout the event.
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff round.
* Top 8 matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* When necessary, standings as of the final Swiss round will be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
