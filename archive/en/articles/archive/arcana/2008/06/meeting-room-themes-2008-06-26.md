We've shown you some peeks at Wizards of the Coast meeting rooms in the past. [Mark Rosewater's 80,000 Words article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr240) showed a couple of the entertaining names, like "Graceland" and "The Bat Cave". But did you know that the meeting rooms actually contain themed artwork? Let's look!


![Graceland](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1620_graceland.jpg)Here's Graceland. As you can see, it's got an enormous orange Elvis on the wall. He's a little distracting,


![The Bat Cave](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1620_BatCave.jpg)The Bat Cave has images from the old Batman serials. And, logically enough, it's right next to a meeting room named "Wayne Manor". There's no tunnel from one to the other, though. Here's the mural in Wayne Manor:


![Wayne Manor](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1620_WayneManor2.jpg)This is more the Batman that people expect. And there's Bat-Mite! If you don't know who Bat-Mite is, there is a world of weirdness waiting for you. We don't really have space to get into it here.


![Scrubland](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1620_scrubland.jpg)A number of meeting rooms around **Magic** R&D are just named after cards. Aaron Forsythe's office used to be [Castle Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle+Sengir), and here's [Scrubland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrubland).


One final note: these meeting rooms are all on the third floor, which is fantasy-themed. Here's a picture of one of the meeting rooms on a different floor, which has a different theme (except for the statue).
