Standard Super League players showed up with quite a collection of brews last week. Paul Cheon wound up winning largely because he accurately predicted that no one would play control decks and he could therefore clean up with Green Devotion (splashing red for [Xenagos, the Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) and [Dragonlord Atarka](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka)). He beat Tom Ross in the finals, who ran a Boss Sligh deck that included [Impact Tremors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Impact+Tremors). The “sweet tech of the week” award, however, has to go to Josh Utter-Leyton. His deck featured the combo of [Become Immense](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) and [Temur Battle Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Battle+Rage), complete with hexproof [Conifer Striders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394522) to point them at and [Temur Chargers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386694) to bestow trample.


However, as sweet as his brew was, it didn’t work out well for Utter-Leyton. He and Brad Nelson were both eliminated in the first round last week. Ross’ finals appearance came after defeating Week 1 winner Owen Turtenwald in the first round and Gerry Thompson in the semifinals. Paul Cheon, meanwhile, cruised to victory after defeating Brian Kibler in his first match, Andrew Cuneo in the semis, and, finally, claiming victory in the finals against Ross.
