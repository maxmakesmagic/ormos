### The Winning Mechanic - Gilbert Espinoza



> **Remove target creature from the game and draw cards equal to its power. At the beginning of your next upkeep, return it to play and discard cards equal to its toughness.**


So, now we know what the card does (and don't worry, we'll have a playtest name shortly – Gilbert Espinoza, the designer of Mechanic J, earns the honor). Now it's time to figure out what it costs. Solving this problem will force us to make two key decisions. One, what color is the card. And two, do we want the card to be an instant or sorcery.


### Color


The spell has two parts. The first is a flickering effect. That's defined as white in the color pie. The second ability is a card filtering effect. That's blue in the color pie. But because every color has some amount of card drawing, card filtering is a little easier to bleed. This means that the spell needs to be either mono-white or white/blue. Note that multi-color spells are cheaper than mono-colored spells as they require the dedication to a second color.


### Speed


When we let you select the card type, we grouped instants and sorceries together as they are concepted the same. This vote will allow you to pick which speed you want. For those out there that enjoy hearing the obvious stated, instants are more expensively costed than sorceries.


That leaves us with four options. Here they are as determined by **Magic** R&D:




|  |
| --- |
| * White sorcery –
* White instant –
* White/Blue sorcery –
* White/Blue instant –
 |

The deadline for this vote is when the site updates Sunday night. I'm curious to see what you select.
