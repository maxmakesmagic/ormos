Day 1 will be Best-of-One Historic Constructed matches. You will play until seven wins or three losses (whichever comes first), with seven wins earning you qualification for Day 2. You'll be able to enter Day 1 multiple times, which means you'll have more than one opportunity to qualify for Day 2.


* **Start:** August 1, 2020 at 8 a.m. PT
* **Signups End:** August 2, 2020 at 4 a.m. PT—you'll still have a few hours to complete your current run, but you won't be able to join after this deadline.
* **Day 1 End:** August 2, 2020 at 7 a.m. PT
* **Format:** Best-of-One Historic Constructed with Match Clock

ENTRY REWARD
------------


In addition to the prizes outlined above, every participant will receive card styles for five new-to-Historic cards through *Jumpstart*. Just as before, these special rewards will unlock as soon as you join the event, so you'll be able to use them during your matches:

Q&A
===


**How many players can earn the monetary rewards on Day 2?**


As many as qualify! All players on Day 2 who earn six or seven wins will be eligible to receive the monetary rewards.


**Is the Arena Open a part of the MPL/*Magic* esports?**


As part of the [2020–2021 Magic Esports](https://magic.gg/news/announcing-the-2020-2021-magic-esports-season) season, players who earn five or more match wins on Day 2 of an Arena Open will also be eligible to participate in the next Qualifier Weekend.


While we recommend you head over the [Magic.gg](https://magic.gg/) for full details, this change will go into effect with this upcoming Arena Open. If you earn five or more wins on Day 2, you'll also be earning a spot in the upcoming *Zendikar Rising* Qualifier Weekend. We do want to note that while we plan to hold Arena Opens on a regular basis, players shouldn't expect one every month (and therefore, for every Qualifier Weekend); reaching the top 1,200 in Mythic—Constructed or Limited—during a ranked season will continue to unlock invitations to a Qualifier Weekend.


**What should I do if I encounter an issue during the Arena Open?** 


If you encounter an issue or need further assistance with the Arena Open, you will need to contact [Game Support](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000419612)—we are unable to provide support for in-game issues over social media (other than telling you to submit a ticket). Please ensure you select "Mythic Events/Arena Open Issues" as the reason you are contacting our support team.


**I reached six/seven wins on Day 2 and earned a monetary reward . . . now what?** 


If you receive a monetary reward, we will contact you via the email listed in your Wizards account to obtain your DCI Account and with instructions for activating your eWallet account with our partner i-Payout (or notifying you of your prize if you have already created an account). Please check your email regularly after the Arena Open to ensure that you respond to our inquiry in a timely manner. If you win a monetary reward and do not receive a reward email within 72 hours of completion of the Arena Open, please contact [customer service](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000419612).


For more information on reward fulfilments, please refer to the full [Terms and Conditions](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arena-open-terms-and-conditions-2020-05-19) and our general [Event Prize Support FAQ](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043704072).

**Start**: May 30, 2020 at 8 a.m. PT

\*For the Arena Open, we are enforcing a 30-minute match clock for each player in both Best-of-One and Best-of-Three matches. As a general reminder, in Best-of-Three matches, this clock is shared across all three games and counts down whenever a player has priority.


Day 1 Deck Submission
---------------------


 Players will submit one (1) 60-card Standard Constructed deck per event run, with optional sideboard\*. You***may not***change your deck between matches. You***may***change your decks in-between event runs (e.g. if Deck 1 doesn't work out, you can re-enter and choose Deck 2). Your Day 1 deck has***no bearing***on your deck choice for Day 2. You may choose the same deck or an entirely new one if you so desire!

 \*Though sideboarding doesn't happen in a Best-of-One match structure, it may be relevant for companion cards or abilities that refer to cards you own "outside of the game."

**Special Entry Reward**: The Godzilla Lands


 7 Wins: 2,000 Gems, Qualification for Day 2 6 Wins: 1,600 Gems 5 Wins: 1,200 Gems 4 Wins: 800 Gems 3 Wins: 400 Gems 0–2 Wins: No Reward

 In addition to the rewards outlined above, every participant will receive the special Godzilla Lands to add to their collection as part of their entry.
