The new year is off to an active start, as two Grand Prix kicked off 2015 in [Manila](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpman15) and [Denver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpden15). The two big events featured the Standard format in its final weeks before *Fate Reforged* shakes things up, and the format proves to be open, as the top deck and the top cards shifts with each passing week. While Andrew Brown's Blue-Black Control left the competition cold in Grand Prix Denver, it was Australia's Joseph Sclauzero who took the trophy home in Manila with his Mardu Midrange deck.



Meanwhile, the Pro Tour Qualifier (PTQ) season that qualifies winners for [Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/qualifiers-pro-tour-dragons-of-tarkir) has been going strong over the holiday season. There is still a good half of the season left, and while *Fate Reforged* will shift around the Standard format, looking at what has been winning will set a good foundation for what will give you the best chance at taking home the win and earning that coveted invitation and airfare to the Pro Tour in April. [Be sure to find a PTQ near you](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/qualifierlist) and maybe we'll see you in Brussels, Belgium, in April!
