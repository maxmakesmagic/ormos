MTG Arena Announcements, June 15, 2022

*Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* Preorders Begin Next Week
===========================================================


*Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* is on the . . . uh, horizon! Preorder the new set beginning next Thursday, June 23.


*Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* is *MTG Arena*'s way of bringing the tabletop set *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* to the digital space. The tabletop Commander set posed some natural challenges, so we brought over cards directly where we could, then had Donald Smith lead the design on 81 new cards. With some truly wild mechanics for more *Baldur's Gate* style, plus returning flavorful reprints from *Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms*, this set is both a major expansion for Alchemy and a great draft experience!


Below is a taste of a few cards you'll find in *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate*, including returning cards from *Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms*, rebalanced cards for Alchemy from *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* and *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms*, plus reimagined cards featuring a mechanic we're not showing off yet!
