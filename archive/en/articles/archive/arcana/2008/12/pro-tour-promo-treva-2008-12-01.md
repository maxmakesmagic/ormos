Well, *do ya?*


You can get your copy of [Treva, the Renewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Treva%252C%2Bthe%2BRenewer) simply by coming to the [2008 World Championships in Memphis](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=events/magic/worlds) or to any of the 2009 Pro Tours (Kyoto February 27-March 1, Honolulu June 5-7, Austin October 16-19). Participation in the main event isn't required—anyone who comes to the event hall can get a free promotional card (while supplies last).
