Tom LaPille

Tom LaPille makes things. Some of the things he makes are card sets, like Dark Ascension and Born of the Gods. Sometimes he makes stories, too. Sometimes he makes unexpected things, like 16th-century Japanese clothing. He's probably making something right now.

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the very last day of *Scars of Mirrodin* previews. I realize that's a bit of a silly thing to say, as the whole set is now up in our [Visual Spoiler](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/scarsofmirrodin/spoiler), so there's not a lot of previewing still happening. However, that means that tomorrow is the *Scars of Mirrodin* Prerelease, your first chance to play with the new set's cards. Prereleases may offer both Sealed Deck and Booster Draft play, so I'll spend some time today talking about *Scars of Mirrodin* Limited. I don't want to give too much away before you've had the chance to play with the cards yourselves, but I can at least show you the tip of the iceberg.
