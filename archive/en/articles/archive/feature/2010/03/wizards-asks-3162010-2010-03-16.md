*What's your favorite board-sweeper?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** My favorite way to clear the board is in *Rise of the Eldrazi*, actually! So ... check back in a couple of weeks!

Okay, okay, fine, I'll answer with one of those "released cards" that I can "actually talk about." As an adherent of both multiplayer and Limited, I'm well aware that sometimes you need to kill everything. (I hear this happens in competitive Constructed sometimes too.)

I'm going to have to go with [Final Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Judgment). I have very fond memories of annihilating a Sealed Deck League by building a monster of a control deck around [Final Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Judgment) and [Keiga, the Tide Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+the+Tide+Star). And you've just got to love the way it sweeps aside [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus)es, shuts down graveyard recursion, and generally lives up to the word "final."
