Day 2 Coverage



From the 1,070 players that started their *Guilds of Ravnica* adventure in Montreal, 206 pushed through to return for the Sunday spotlight. Four scored a perfect 9-0 match record—Brad Bonin, Chris Ha, Alexandre Cadieux and Alex Watt—to fill half of the first Draft this morning.


Behind the quartet leading off Day 2 lurk a bevy of professionals ready to stake a claim on a Grand Prix Trophy. From Ari Lax—also in the first Draft pod—and Bertrand Joseph-Pare to Rich Hoaen, Oliver Tomajko and Alexander Hayne, two sets of drafts will determine who makes the Top 8 cut tonight.
