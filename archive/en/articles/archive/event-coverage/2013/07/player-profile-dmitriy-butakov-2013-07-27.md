The 2013 **Magic Online** Championship winner, Dmitri "Butakov" Butakov, is one of the newer faces that will be appearing at this year's 2013 **Magic** World Championship. While he earned his spot in the World Championship via his performance in the MOCS, it is impossible to take anything away from him. The players he had to defeat on his way to the title included Canadian Pro player David Caplan, Dutch stream master Jan van der Vegt, and Grand Prix champion Sam Pardee. He even had to face fellow World Championship competitor Reid Duke.


Having earned his MOCS entry via his performance in Modern, Butakov's experience in the MOCS provides him a leg up on the multi-format nature of the World Championship. The Russian player treats **Magic Online** as a full-time job, spending upwards of forty hours a week practicing and preparing, something that will be immensely helpful in the weeks leading up to the World Championship.


Having initially viewed **Magic** as a source of income, as a true professional does, his time in the MOCS has begun to change that. This trip to Amsterdam will be our first chance to see if Butakov can continue his success in a transition to paper **Magic** in the same way that Brad Nelson and Reid Duke did before him.
