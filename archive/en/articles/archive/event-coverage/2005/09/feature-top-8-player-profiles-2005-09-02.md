### Masashi Oiso


**Age:** 21  
**Residence:** Hiroshima Prefecture  
**Occupation:** College student


**Significant Achievements:** I've been in the Top 8 of a PT and a GP once or twice.  
**Draft Colors:** Red-green both drafts  
**Any Interesting Stories from the Draft?** I was really happy to open [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker) in the first draft, but I didn't get him out in any of my four matches.  
**Standard Deck:** Blue Urzatron (designed by Katsuhiro Mori)  
**Why Did You Choose This Deck?** Because it's got a lot of power.  
**Any Interesting Stories from the Standard Rounds?** Not really, but I think it's ridiculous what you can do if you get the Urzatron working.  
**Playtest Partner(s) for Nationals:** I didn't have much time to prepare, so I mostly tested my deck by myself.  
**This is the 10th National Championship. Any Stories From the Past You'd Like to Share?** I haven't really played in Nationals, so I don't have any.

**Standard Deck:** Urza [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail), with a touch of red.  
**Any Interesting Stories from the Standard Rounds?** I wouldn't have made Top 8 if Morofuji hadn't offered me a draw.  
**Playtest Partner(s) for Nationals:** Asahara and his regular group  
**This is the 10th National Championship. Any Stories From the Past You'd Like to Share?** Obviously, the best Championship for me was 2002, when I won using Psychatog.

**Standard Deck:** "RazorTron" (self-designed)  
**Why Did You Choose This Deck?** I've been using Tron forever, so I'm comfortable with it.

**Standard Deck:** "RazorTron" (designed by Makihito Mihara)  
**Any Interesting Stories from the Standard Rounds?** This is the most intense **Magic** I've ever played. I feel drained after every match.
