Well, the original German has dusted off the wand and is taking Worlds by storm. He's sitting comfortably with a 9-2 record. Not as comfortable as Dutch dynamo Jeroen Remie. Starting with his Top 8 at Houston at the beginning of the season, Remie has been in top form. After going undefeated on the first day, he's only dropped a single match in draft, and he'd like to keep that streak alive. 

### Game 1

Kröger led with [Festering Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin) and got some damage in before both players dropped morphs on their third turn. Remie's bashed in, and then he tapped out for [Aphetto Runecaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Runecaster). Kröger untapped and revealed his morph to be [Aphetto Exterminator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Exterminator), giving Remie a card but eliminating the Runecaster. He answered with a [Covert Operative](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covert+Operative) and held his ground.

Kröger attacked and Remie accepted the trade, losing what turned out to be a Volcanist. Kröger replaced his morph and added a Farseer. Remie busted out [Lavamancer's Skill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill) and started working over Kröger's team. He added a [Thoughtbound Primoc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtbound+Primoc) and started serving for damage. Eventually Kröger hit eight lands to enable a [Skinthinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinthinner) on the gunning Operative, but the damage had been done. Remie added a Seaswift to his air force, and Kröger couldn't make the race close enough.

Remie 1 – Kröger 0

### Game 2

Again Kröger had the [Festering Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin) in the second game, but now he was leading and was given the first opportunity to swing in with a morph. Remie had a morph of his own, a [Skirk Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Marauder), and opted for the trade. Kröger's morph was [Cabal Executioner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Executioner). He replaced it with another morph. Remie dropped [Aphetto Runecaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Runecaster), forcing him to stay home. Kroger made another morph. Remie untapped and showed him [Lavamancer's Skill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill).

"Skill again!" – Peer Kroger

"Yep. Pure skill, that." – Jeroen Remie

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a765.jpg)He shot down the first morph, a [Sootfeather Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sootfeather+Flock), and was so excited about stopping the remaining [Skinthinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinthinner) with [Mage's Guile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mage%27s+Guile) that he forgot to draw a card for his Runecaster. It didn't matter. [Sage Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Aven) got him a Seaswift and [Erratic Explosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion) in hand meant he wouldn't have to draw all those lands. [Bladewing's Thrall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladewing%27s+Thrall) showed up just in time to take the Explosion in the face.

[Aurification](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurification) from Kröger would have been gangbusters if not for Remie's Seaswift. [Aphetto Exterminator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Exterminator) took down the Runecaster (though this time Remie made sure to get his card), but soon after Remie showed him a second Skill. If only he could finish the Seaswift, he could stabilize. [Infernal Caretaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Caretaker) got him back the [Skinthinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinthinner), but he failed to draw an eighth land.

"Would have been good to draw a land there." – Peer Kröger

"Or a [Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeance) or something." – Jeroen Remie

"I guess I'm dead." – Peer Kröger

"That's nice." – Jeroen Remie

**Final Result:** Jeroen Remie defeats Peer Kröger 2-0
