Wednesday means one thing: an update to the [*Rise of the Eldrazi* Product Section](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/Products.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/products/riseoftheeldrazi)! It also means other things, like Savor the Flavor and Building on a Budget and even some things not related to Daily MTG at all. But we're talking about the [*Rise of the Eldrazi* Product Section](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/Products.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/products/riseoftheeldrazi) here. And why wouldn't we? There's a new article about the storyline, a new puzzle, a new wallpaper, and new cards on the Visual Spoiler, the archive of all preview cards that have been officially released. That one gets going to be updated frequently over the next two and a half weeks as we count down to the *Rise of the Eldrazi* Prerelease on April 17-18.
