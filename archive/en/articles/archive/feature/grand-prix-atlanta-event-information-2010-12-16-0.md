**Air Travel**  
 Hartsfield International Airport, just fifteen minutes south of downtown Atlanta, is a two-hour flight (or less) from 80% of the population of the United States and is the international hub for [Delta Airlines](http://www.delta.com/home/index.jsp).


**Airport sites:**  


* [Hartsfield International Airport Official Site](http://www.atlanta-airport.com/)
* [FAA's official Hartsfield site](http://www.fly.faa.gov/flyFAA/flyfaaindex.html?ARPT=ATL) (includes major flight delays)

**Automotive Travel**  
 For those planning to drive, Atlanta is accessible by three major interstate highways: I-75, I-85, and I-20. Tip: in Georgia, it is legal to turn left on red onto a one-way road from a one-way road if the road is clear and there are no signs present decreeing otherwise. You don't get to do this often, but you'll have ample chances downtown so enjoy it!


**Parking:** There is very little free parking in downtown Atlanta so a Parking Information Sheet on the Hilton and other local options is available on our information sites.


**Traveling North on I-75** (ie from South Georgia, Florida, etc.): Take exit 249B on the left toward Peachtree St/Pine St/Civic Center then merge onto Piedmont Avenue NE. Turn left onto Baker Street NE followed by the first left onto Courtland Street NE.


**Traveling South on I-75** (ie From North Georgia, Tennessee, etc.): Take exit 249A for Courtland Street NE toward Georgia State University. Merge onto Courtland St NE.


**Traveling East or West on I-20** (ie From Augusta, Charleston, Mississippi, and Alabama etc.): Take exit 57 to merge onto I-75 North/I-85 North toward Chattanooga/Greenville. Take exit 249B on the left toward Peachtree St/Pine St/Civic Center. Merge onto Piedmont Ave NE. Turn left onto Baker Street NE followed by the first left onto Courtland Street NE.


**Traveling South on I-85** (ie from North Carolina, Greenville, etc.): Merge onto I-75 South. Take exit 249A for Courtland Street NE toward Georgia State University. Merge onto Courtland St NE.


**MARTA Public Transportation**  
 Atlanta boasts the second-highest rated public transportation system in North America - The **M**etropolitan **A**tlanta **R**apid **T**ransit **A**uthority, [MARTA](http://www.itsmarta.com/) - with rapid rail service directly from Hartsfield International Airport to the Peachtree Center Rail Station. This station, "carved from the very living rock" ninety feet below Peachtree Street in downtown, is directly connected to the Hyatt Regency and the Marriott through the Peachtree Center Mall and Food Court. The entire walk is covered and almost entirely climate-controlled. The one-way MARTA fare anywhere on the system is still $2.00. The MARTA rail system shuts down from c. 1:00 a.m. - 5:00 a.m. for track inspection and maintenance, so plan to take alternate transportation to downtown (hotel shuttle, cab, rental car) if you're arriving or departing in the wee hours of the morning. A compiled MARTA Information Sheet & Map are available on our information sites.
