Grand Prix Sacramento 2014 - Quick Questions #3
===============================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on January 19, 2014 










Yesterday, we took a look at card advantage (the overarching strategy that involves trading cards for more cards) in *Theros* Limited. The expensive nature of removal in the format makes it relatively difficult to accrue an economic advantage. 


Today, I caught up with some big names and asked them, "What's the most interesting way you've accrued card advantage this weekend?"

***Brian David-Marshall:** "My opponent cast [Ordeal of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Erebos) on his [Staunch-Hearted Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staunch-Hearted+Warrior) and attacked me when I had two cards in hand. I cast [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict) and dealt with both cards while preserving the last card in my hand."*

***No. 13 Ranked Player Tom Martell:** "I had [Hundred-Handed One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundred-Handed+One) in play with seven mana up. My opponent suicided eight points of power into the red zone to deal with the bomb. I used the Monstrous ability to block all of them. My opponent tried to [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) my [Hundred-Handed One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundred-Handed+One) in response to Monstrous. I used [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) to give my creature protection from Black, countering my opponent's removal spell and killing his entire board. Is that card advantage?"*
