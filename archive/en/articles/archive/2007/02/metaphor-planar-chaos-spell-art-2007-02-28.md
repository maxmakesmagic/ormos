Metaphor in *Planar Chaos* Spell Art

J[eremy Jarvis](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/authorarchive&author=JeremyJarvis) became **Magic** art director partway through *Time Spiral* Block. One of Jeremy's goals when he took over the job was to push for "spell" art that was less literal and more abstract and metaphorical. Creature cards basically have to depict the creatures they represent, but spells (meaning instants, sorceries, and sometimes enchantments in this context) can be less directly representational while still maintaining visual impact and drama.


You can see the results of his philosophy in these four *Planar Chaos* spells. In each one, note how the visuals give a metaphorical *impression* of the spell effect rather than literally *showing* what's happening in the duel between planeswalkers.
