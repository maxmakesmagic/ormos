### Jim Herold

 Did some drafts with friends from Hamburg. I also play each week at a store called Dragon's Egg.


**What is the top Planar Chaos common?**  

 Dead/Gone


**What was your draft strategy? Did you stick with it all weekend, or did you have to change it?**  

 I tried to stay away from black, but in the second draft I was convinced to take it because it was flowing. If people passed it to me, I took it.


**How did your draft strategies for Time Spiral block change with the addition of Planar Chaos?**  

 In Time Spiral, I mostly liked to draft blue/red suspend-storm decks. Since Planar Chaos that has changed - green is stronger, blue weaker.

**1.** 2-1(B/R) **2.** 3-0(U/R) **3.** 2-1 (W/B) **4.** 2-1 (U/R) **5.** 2-0-1 (G/R)


**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare with?**  

 2v2's with Jake Meiser, JR Wade and Taylor Parnell. 2v2's don't really improve your drafting ability, but you become a lot more familiar with the cards.


**What is the top Planar Chaos common?**  
[Shaper Parasite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite)



**What was your draft strategy? Did you stick with it all weekend, or did you have to change it?**  

 Draft whatever is open, as long as it's not G/B. White was very overdrafted, so I tried to avoid it for the most part


**How did your draft strategies for Time Spiral block change with the addition of Planar Chaos?**  

 Everyone suddenly hates black, which makes the white-black rebel deck very strong. Blue-red is weaker and I try to avoid it unless I get a really strong first pack.

 Infinite drafting with local Madison players, most notably Matt Severa, Brian Kowal, Dustin Stern, Sam Black and Az Spear


**What is the top Planar Chaos common?**   

 I'd most like to see
 [Rathi Trapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Trapper)
 , but
 [Dead & Gone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+%2F%2F+Gone)
 is the best


**What was your draft strategy? Did you stick with it all weekend, or did you have to change it?** Take whatever is coming but avoid green at almost any cost, and hope to be black - x. This worked for me all weekend.


**How did your draft strategies for Time Spiral block change with the addition of Planar Chaos?**  

 Basic strategy remained the same... black and blue if possible. Some cards went up/down in value because of one less Time Spiral pack (for example
 [Ivory Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Giant)
 is a little worse, and
 [Amrou Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Scout)
 got a little better)
