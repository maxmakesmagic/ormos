| “Black/Red if it’s open. It’s pretty heavily drafted.” | “Blue/White.” | “Blue/Green, because Jarrod Scriven said so!” |
| **Wilfy Horig** | **Ian Wood** | **Dan Unwin** |
|  |  |  |
| “Not Green!” | “Blue/Black.” | “I haven’t drafted the same combination twice. Just as long as I’m not Green and I have a good curve.” |
