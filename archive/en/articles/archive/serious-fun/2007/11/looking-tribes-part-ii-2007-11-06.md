Last week, we looked at the first three tribes of *Lorwyn*, grading according to several criteria: 




* Strategy: What the tribe wants to do, and how well that would fare in multiplayer.
* Versatility: Can the tribe win in more than one way, or is it restricted to only lockdown or only attacking?
* Individuality: How much are you going to have to commit to the table before your tribe becomes a real threat?
* Recyclability: Can the tribe bring back its members once they fall in battle? Or can they draw you more cards to make up for it once they go?
* Antiquity: Hey, *Lorwyn*'s cool and all, but some of us kids have older cards. What does this tribe's pre-*Lorwyn* members bring to their gameplan?

With that in mind, let's launch into one of the most beloved tribes of all time: 

### Tribe #4: Elves

**Strategy**

![Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Imperious+Perfect)Get a bunch of Elves and tokens out there, make them bigger, and whomp face with 'em. While you're doing that, provide some light disruption and removal. *Rating:* While the combat phase has always been a tricky way to win in multiplayer (barring some huge finishing creature with evasion or an [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effect, both of which the Elves lack innately), the Elf tribe has a lot of built-in card advantage built in that helps it considerably. 

Get an [Imperious Perfect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect) out there, and you can build your own Elf army without playing another card from your hand. [Immaculate Magistrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immaculate+Magistrate) swells that army, and cards like [Elvish Branchbender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Branchbender), [Jagged-Scar Archers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jagged-Scar+Archers), and [Lys Alana Scarblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Scarblade) take advantage of those tokens.

You're still slightly handicapped by the fact that your guys start out at around 2/2 on average, but the ability to make a lot more of them helps. 

**Versatility**

The Elves have a couple of options—[Eyeblight's Ending](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending) is a solid removal spell, and the previously mentioned [Elvish Branchbender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Branchbender), [Jagged-Scar Archers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jagged-Scar+Archers), and [Lys Alana Scarblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Scarblade) can help control the flow of combat for you...

...assuming that you have enough Elves, which is the problem. This would be a very versatile tribe, if they worked consistently. As it is, you can destroy almost anything with flying that looks at you sideways or axe a [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus), assuming you're lucky enough to get everything out. If not, you might be stuck with a piddly 1/1 effect. As such, the Elves can be fairly versatile in theory, but might stick a little in practice.

Also, it should be noted that the Elves of *Lorwyn*, unlike previous Elves, aren't particularly good at dealing with artifacts. I think that's because they like mirrors too much to smash them. 

*Ranking:* Medium. Shoots to "insane," however, when you factor in older cards. 

**Individuality**

The good news is that since Elves bring their own armies, you don't particularly need to play a lot of them in order to get the eventual effect. It'll take some time, sure, but you don't have to plop your whole hand down on the table and walk straight into a [Damnation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation). Heck, as noted, one [Wren's Run Packmaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wren%27s+Run+Packmaster) is an army by itself. 

*Ranking:* Medium. 

**Recyclability**

The Elves aren't particularly good at bringing each other back from the grave, but the power of [Masked Admirers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masked+Admirers)—a card that not only draws you more Elves, but can be brought back at a low, low price—would make the Elves noteworthy by itself. 

Plus, then you throw in [Prowess of the Fair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prowess+of+the+Fair) and you don't quite have recycling, but you have the ability to get things back when your real Elves die. That's solid, and bumps it up to a strong medium.

*Rating:* Medium to high.

**Antiquity**

Are you kidding? Elves are one of the oldest tribes in existence—they were tribal before tribal was cool. As such, we have a dizzying array of Elves to select from.

![Caller of the Claw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Caller+of+the+Claw)Unfortunately, most of what the old Elves do is to generate humongous amounts of mana—you can't beat a [Priest of Titania](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Titania) and [Rofellos, Llanowar Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rofellos%2C+Llanowar+Emissary) to get ten mana by turn four. That's kind of at odds with this new "generate tokens and swing" plan. Still, there are a couple of noteworthy Elves that help out here, most of them from *Onslaught*: [Caller of the Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caller+of+the+Claw) helps you rebound from any pesky Wrath effects, as do [Elvish Soultiller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Soultiller) (which gets 'em back into your library), [Golgari Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Guildmage) (gets 'em back into play with a sacrifice), or the ever-popular [Wirewood Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Herald), which tutors any Elf to your hand when it dies. 

[Eladamri, Lord of Leaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eladamri%2C+Lord+of+Leaves) is kind of an alternate [Elvish Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Champion), and worth looking into if spot removal's big in your group. [Gaea's Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Herald), on the other hand, is your man if counterspells run rampant. [Multani's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Multani%27s+Acolyte) can draw you cards, and [Sylvan Messenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Messenger) can draw you a lot of Elves. 

Of course, there's no getting around one of the better Elves for multiplayer—[Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf) can turn any Elf into a huge finisher. And if you're looking for "huge finisher," [Titania's Chosen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titania%27s+Chosen) usually dies pretty early, but I've seen him get up to 15/15 while people were preoccupied with other guys.

[Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) can turn any game into a long, drawn-out painful stall as people try to kill you when you're at seventy-billion life.

And if you want big tokens, try [Voice of the Woods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+the+Woods) (and, if you're looking to throw in some blue, add in the Voice's comedic buddy, [Intruder Alarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intruder+Alarm)). 

**Standard-Legal Hole-Fixing**

75 Cards 




![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Forest)

















That's a deck that could be ported to multiplayer with very little effort. The only cards that are questionable here is [Boreal Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid) (acceleration isn't quite as important in multiplayer) and [Nath of the Gilt-Leaf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath+of+the+Gilt-Leaf), which affects only a single player... But even so, this deck would probably still do fairly well, crushing any deck with [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s in it. (And you're slightly more likely to get off that [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effect in multiplayer with Garruk—which is good, because you'll probably need it slightly more.) 

I'm just moonshining here, but the only change I might make involves couple of [Lys Alana Scarblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Scarblade)s in place of the [Boreal Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid)s, which gives you a way to control the board in an Elfy way, or perhaps up the count of [Masked Admirers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masked+Admirers) to four to aim for the long game. Then again, if your group is token-crazy, there's always piggybacking your way to skyrocketing life totals with [Essence Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden)....

(Why am I down on the [Boreal Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid)? Unless heavy mana acceleration ramps you straight into something that wins the game like an [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath) or a [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail), it's usually a slot that would be better used on strength. Four acceleration slots are fine to speed the deck up a bit, but seven's a little much.) 

Otherwise, this is surprisingly solid as a midrange beatdown deck for multiplayer. Well done. 

### Tribe #5: Treefolk

**Strategy**

They make large, unstoppable Treefolk and then attack. Not much more to it than that. 

*Rating:* While the giants were big, they did have some other things going for 'em. Unfortunately, "big" is almost all the Treefolk have in their favor. In fact, the best Treefolk—which would almost unquestionably be [Doran, the Siege Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower)—doesn't really play friendly with his mates, requiring three colors and not giving much of an advantage to the Treefolk in general. 

(Turning a 3/4 into a 4/4 or a 5/7 into a 7/7? Not *nearly* the boost that turning an 0/5 [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) into a 5/5 blocker gets you.) 

Alas, this makes Treefolk a bit of an uphill climb in *Lorwyn*. (Get it? Climb? *Tree*? Oh, never mind.)

**Versatility**

![Rootgrapple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rootgrapple)The Treefolk don't have much. They make other guys larger, and tougher, and fetch [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s. That's about it. Well, there is the quasi-removal spell [Lignify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lignify), which sounds awesome but then leaves your opponent with a blocker than can be tough to get through. It's better than being smashed with, say, [Numot, the Devastator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Numot%2C+the+Devastator), but not by much. (Though as Brian David-Marshall notes, the nice thing is that the creature is still legendary and retains its name, so a Lignified Numot will still destroy any freshly played Numots thanks to the legend rule.) 

[Rootgrapple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootgrapple) is also an excellent (if slightly expensive) instant-speed, non-critter removal spell that vaniquishes planeswalkers at a touch. 

So they can clear the way for combat. A little. 

*Rating:* Low. 

**Individuality**

As is usual with large men, one [Dauntless Dourbark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Dourbark) or [Oakgnarl Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oakgnarl+Warrior) is a force to be reckoned with. Thus, you don't have to play too many of them at once—although since they work in tandem, their ideal number is about three or four if you're worried about global removal of some sort. (If you're not concerned about global removal, then *every* tribe's ideal number is "infinite.") 

*Rating:* Medium to high. 

**Recyclability**

You'd think that the Treefolk, being green and made of paper themselves, would be big on recycling. But as it turns out, once they go to the graveyard, they take the eternal dirt nap. 

*Rating:* Low, but brought higher once you bring in [Deadwood Treefolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadwood+Treefolk). 

**Antiquity**

The Treefolk have been around for a long time, but haven't gotten much love from Wizards until now. There are a few, but most of them are vanilla dudes (like Ironroot Treefolk) or guys with marginal effects (such as [Treefolk Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Mystic)). 

![Deadwood Treefolk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Deadwood+Treefolk)[Cradle Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cradle+Guard) comes out early and is solid on offense and defense, if you can pay his echo cost... but in the end, he's just a big bruiser. [Heartwood Storyteller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartwood+Storyteller)? Well, it discourages people from playing non-dude spells, but it may arm your opponents as well. [Deadwood Treefolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadwood+Treefolk), on the other hand, definitely ups the recyclability factor, bringing back not one but two guys and serving as a respectable wall until he fades away. And [Weatherseed Treefolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weatherseed+Treefolk) is an old classic that comes back whenever he dies (not unlike [Weatherseed Totem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Weatherseed%2BTotem)). 

[Heartwood Treefolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartwood+Treefolk) has evasion that might prove worthy in a standoff—[Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)walk. But [Magnigoth Treefolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magnigoth+Treefolk) can walk in all five basic lands, assuming you have the right set of basic lands out. (Unfortunately, it's a *lot* harder to do that with basic lands.) 

[Nemata, Grove Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemata%2C+Grove+Guardian) is perhaps one of the greatest non-Treefolk-boosting Treefolk in existence. I've won a lot of games with her in my time, but usually when I was piloting Saproling decks. Still, considering that she's a [Wren's Run Packmaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wren%27s+Run+Packmaster) without the champion and with the ability to turn her entire army into gigantic finishers, who cares? 

Oh, did I forget to mention the greatest ancient Treefolk of 'em all? Oh, well, just hang on a moment, he's comin'.

**Standard-Legal Hole-Fixing**

Considering that the Treefolk thrive on [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s, it seems a little silly to throw Doran in when we're looking to max out on those basic lands. I *like* Doran, but he seems standoffish, almost as though he's afraid to mix it up with his brothers. 

Plus, we have a quasi-combo deck waiting in the wings. Can we forget the ever-popular enchantment—if by "popular," you mean "almost forgotten although it was just printed"—[Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb)? 

Oh, yes, now we can start getting truly stupid here. [Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb) + Saprolings + guys that trigger off of [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s and Saprolings = silly deck that might just take your opponents by surprise.

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Forest)

















It's a pretty simple strategy: in the early game, use [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth), [Treefolk Harbinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger), and [Hunting Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Wilds) to fetch as many [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s out of your deck as you can. Then play [Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb) to turn all of your Saproling Tokens into [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s (hopefully putting them under the protection of [Timber Protector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timber+Protector) so you don't lose all your land to a stray [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm)), and start churning out tokens with [Verdant Embrace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Embrace), [Sprout Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprout+Swarm), and of course Verdeloth his bad self. (Verdeloth is Some Good, baby.) 

When you turn out tokens, things will get larger. [Dauntless Dourbark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Dourbark) will become a *gigantic* trampler, and [Battlewand Oak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewand+Oak) can become a surprise killer if your opponent doesn't know that you have [Sprout Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprout+Swarm) in hand. ("You don't block [Battlewand Oak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewand+Oak)? I'll [Sprout Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprout+Swarm) three times with buyback; now thanks to [Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb), three [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s just came into play—he's an 7/9. Eat oak, chum!") 

![Life and Limb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Life+and+Limb)If you don't have [Verdant Embrace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Embrace), you can go with the old cheapie [Blanchwood Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blanchwood+Armor), which will also serve to make your guys huge. [Baru, Fist of Krosa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baru%2C+Fist+of+Krosa) is also spicy in a deck that can put many Forests into play, so if you’ve got him you should consider finding room. And, of course, if you feel like being thematically correct, what could be a more perfect play than [Might of Oaks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Oaks)? Incidentally, the whole problem with this deck is that one removal spell can kill you. A [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) on [Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb) can send your whole plan catapulting into the graveyard. Hence, if Standard's not your game, you might want to think about dipping a block back and fetching [Privileged Position](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Privileged+Position) to help protect your strategy.

There's also one other danger here, as discovered by reader Martin H. He was emailing me to tell me about his usage of [The Rabbit Move](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/rabbit-move-2007-10-16) when in fact he was facing a deck that was doing this very [Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb) strategy. But I'll let him tell you what he did:


> 
>  It's my go. I play possum, do nothing, pretend to punch my deck off the table, and whinge about having played a grand total of about five cards all game, woe is me. My friend with the [Verdant Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force)s decides to leave me alone for a turn; I seem mostly harmless, and I've had a rough trot in the first twenty turns or so.
> 
> 
> It's my go. I topdeck... [Acidic Soil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Soil).
> 
> 
> I tap out and play it. His [Verdant Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force)s have given him sixteen Saprolings by now. They all count as forests thanks to [Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb). 
> 
> 
> He's dead. I'm alive and at 3 life. The other six at the table spend the next five minutes laughing until they're crying, and then shake my hand.
> 
> 
> I suspect the Rabbit Move won't be working again for me for a while, unfortunately, as my playgroup now has a COMPLETE mistrust of my topdecking skills!
> 
> 
> 

Say it with me, class: BWAH HAH HAH. 

### Tribe #6: Elementals

**Strategy, Versatility, Individuality, Recyclability, Antiquity**

Unfortunately for the Elementals, there really isn't a clear strategy; they're kind of a tribe, but they're scattered throughout the colors without nearly as clear a focus. The main theme, however, is "red guys that do stuff," followed by a bunch of evokers, followed by a bunch of the potent Incarnations. 

Thus, it's kind of hard to pull them together into a coherent theme, or even to judge them properly. They're not so much a tribe as a stitch-together, and I can't really say for sure. 

Hence, they're out of the ranking system... Even, sadly, the "antiquity" section, since I can't discuss how newer Elementals work with older Elementals when they're all so darned independent. (Come on, you *know* you want to build an Ageless One deck.) But that won't stop me from trying to build a deck!

**Standard-Legal Hole-Fixing**

![Hostility](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hostility)The best Elemental is clearly [Shriekmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw). Any time we can recurse [Shriekmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw), we have card advantage—and card advantage is key in multiplayer. But I don't want to use [Shriekmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw), because there's something better to try. Something that will *never ever* work. 

Imagine this: 

"Play [Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium)."

"Okay." 

[Time passes, and hopefully nothing good gets killed in the meantime.]

"During my next turn, I'll use this mana from [Smokebraider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokebraider) to use [Incandescent Soulstoke](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incandescent+Soulstoke) to put [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) from my hand into play. [Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium) triggers, letting [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) do 6 damage to your face—oh, wait, no, 7, because the Soulstoke pumps [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility)." 

"Ouch."

"After that trigger resolves, I'll retain priority and play [Molten Disaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Disaster) for four with split second. Since you can't respond to that before it resolves, the replacement effect of [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) makes... oh, I dunno... four 3/1—sorry, make that 4/2—tokens for each player."

"Yeah... About that...."

"I'll use [Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium) to deal 16 damage to each of you, and then attack with my hasty tokens. GG!"

Is that likely? Of course not! Someone's going to see something coming, and will pop your [Incandescent Soulstoke](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incandescent+Soulstoke)*long* before you can do anything. Or someone will just [Eyeblight's Ending](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending) the [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) when you don't draw the [Molten Disaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Disaster) with it. Or someone will [Disenchant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant) the [Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium) before the [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) comes into play. 

But this is the sort of deck that makes Johnny *dream*, my friend.

(Incidentally, while it would be nice if [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility)'s replacement effect turned [Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium) damage into creatures into more damage for an infinite loop, that doesn't work because [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) says "If a *spell* you control would deal damage...." Alas, neither [Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium) nor the creature dealing the damage is currently a spell. You'll have to settle for just hitting someone for 6 in the face.)

The odds of this happening are catastrophically unlikely. In fact, that's what I'm naming this deck:

Oh, it's never going to happen. But we can hope that one day, we'll have the kind of play we'll be boasting about at tournaments for years to come..... 

(Also, please note that unlike many 3/1 dudes who come into play, the tokens from [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) stick around. That's nice to know if someone plays [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog).) 

I should add that other crazy plays can happen as a result of [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility). Take my friend Ian, for example. Last Tuesday, he was playing his Elemental deck and played [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility). Someone else [Mimeofacture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mimeofacture)d it. 

Well, Ian didn't like that. He's a very Hostile man. So he used [Grab the Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins) to steal the [Mimeofacture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mimeofacture)d [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) for a turn. Then he played [Sizzle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sizzle), creating twelve 3/1 hasty tokens (3 per opponent—remember, only one Hostility can replace a given point of damage) on top of the two Hostilities and whatever else he had at the time.

I'll quote Ian: "Winzzor! Everyone else just gave up en masse." 

We can also dream of a deck that involves abusing [Shriekmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw)'s comes-into-play ability with [Changeling Berserker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Berserker), Nova Elemental, and [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return), and then mopping up with a truly impressive [Cairn Wanderer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cairn+Wanderer)... But I'll leave that exercise to you. 

Next week: The last of the tribes!
