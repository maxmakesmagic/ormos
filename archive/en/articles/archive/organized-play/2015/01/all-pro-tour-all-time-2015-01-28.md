*Editor's Note: Please note the closing time for registration at the Pro Tour has been changed from 8 p.m. to 7 p.m., contrary the information contained in an earlier version of this article.*

Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* fast approaches. The first Pro Tour of 2015 will not only test competitors in their knowledge of a new Draft format, featuring one pack of *Fate Reforged* followed by two packs of *Khans of Tarkir*, but it will also test their deck-tuning and playing skills in a brand-new Modern Constructed format.

Whether you're playing in the Pro Tour or watching it from home, there's some key stuff you'll want to know going into next week's three days of epic games and legendary faces.

Pro Tour Competitors and Visitors
=================================



Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* takes place at the [Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/wasgn-gaylord-national-resort-and-convention-center/). If you're flying in for this event, chances are that you will be arriving at Ronald Regan—Washington International Airport (DCA). If you're arriving at Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD), you're going to be a bit farther away.



Regardless of the airport you are landing at, Super Shuttle is an option that will get you to the venue: [Super Shuttle](http://www.supershuttle.com/) offers transportation from both airports to your destination.



For players, registration for the big event begins on Thursday at 4 p.m. local time and will run until 7 p.m. local time. If you are unable to check in during these times, [*please let us know immediately*](mailto:premierplay@wizards.com). Remember to bring a form of identification with you! This can be a driver's license or a passport, and chances are you have one of these if you're coming to the Pro Tour. Don't leave it at the hotel!



If you need cards for your deck, we will have two on-site vendors: Cape Fear Games and Card Titan. While we are working closely with them to make sure we have the wide selection of cards that Modern Constructed oftentimes demands, we can't guarantee they will have everything you want. I highly recommend contacting them via email if you need something specific so that they can prepare accordingly. Their email addresses are:



[info@capefeargames.com](mailto:info@capefeargames.com)



[info@cartitan.com](mailto:info@cartitan.com)



The tournament hall opens at 8 a.m. Friday through Sunday, and closes at 9 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. We will be closing the hall on Sunday at 6 p.m.



If you're not playing, no worries, because you're also invited to attend! We'll have tables set up so visitors are able to observe every match on the tournament floor, and the live stream will also be set up in an enclosed area if you wish to enjoy the broadcast.



In addition to that, Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* is your chance to get a couple of sweet exclusives for purchase, such as this playmat featuring the alternative art of [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon)!


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/OP20150128_ptfrf_playmat.jpg)




If you're more fond of things that show off your utter contempt for Ugin, then you may be more interested in the exclusive Funko POP! figure of Nicol Bolas instead.

That T-shirt Nicol Bolas is standing on is also up for grabs as well.




What if I'm not coming?
=======================



Don't worry! You can still be part of Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* by tuning in to the broadcast!



The Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* broadcast will begin all three days at 9 a.m. local time (ET)/6 a.m. PT/2 p.m. GMT on the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic), and we'll be bringing you nonstop coverage from start to finish each day. When we're not showing you *Magic* in progress, we'll be showing you Deck Techs, draft picks, player interviews, and a whole lot more!



The Pro Tour coverage video crew features Rich Hagon, Brian-David Marshall, Randy Buehler, Marshall Sutcliffe, and Rashad Miller.



Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* will also be the premiere show for the newest member of our video commentary team: Ian Duke.

> "Before I joined Wizards [of the Coast], competitive *Magic* was a huge part of my life. I'm excited to be a part of the coverage team and help bring the tournament experience to a wider *Magic* audience."

Ian will be in the booth and in the studio providing both insight as a former player and as an R&D insider, and we are delighted to have him join the team.

The Flashback
=============



Last weekend featured something special: the 2015 Super Sunday Series Championship, where 44 players from eighteen different countries—all winners of Super Sunday Series tournaments in last year's GPs—were invited on an all-expenses paid trip to Wizards of the Coast HQ in Renton, Washington.



In this special invitation-only event, the players competed across three different formats, with a Standard Constructed Top 8 to determine the winner. The finals pitted Denmark's Oscar Christensen against Argentina's Luis Salvatto, and through three games, it was Salvatto's [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege) representing Dragons and then Khans in his two wins that ultimately led to the Argentinian's victory.

*2015 Super Sunday Series Champion Luis Salvatto*



Of course, while they were playing for a very nice $6,000 prize, the weekend itself was an opportunity for the 44 competitors to become good friends and partake in some fun afterhours, including a ton of free drafts with Wizards staff.



In fact, it was after the end-of-weekend dinner where some players and staff were able to participate in a very sweet Cube draft courtesy of competitor Anatoli Lightfoot: a Cube comprised of cards only up to *Weatherlight*. Talk about a blast from the past!



Full coverage can be found [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2015SSSC), but let's take a look at a couple of highlights:



[What Is the Super Sunday Series?](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2015SSSC/what-super-sunday-series-2015-01-24)—While the 2015 Super Sunday Series Championship is a fun event, for many it leads to a key question: how did these players qualify? I got a chance to talk to tournament organizer Alan Hochman about what the Super Sunday Series is, when it got started, and where you can participate in one.



[Wizards of the Coast: A Photo Tour](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2015SSSC/wizards-coast-photo-tour-2015-01-24)—During lunch on Saturday, the competitors were taken on a tour of the Wizards of the Coast HQ fourth floor, where they got a chance to see a lot of prints and statues from *Magic*'s history, and also got to be in a group photo with Mitzy, the dragon that watches over the Wizards guest lobby.
