Historic Anthology Bundle - Q&A
-------------------------------






**Will you be able to craft cards from the Historic Anthology 1 bundle?**


Yes, you will be able to craft any Historic card, including cards from the Historic Anthology 1 bundle, at 1:1 Wildcard redemption rate.


**Will I be able to purchase Historic cards outside of the Historic Anthology 1 bundle?**


Currently, our plan is to only offer these cards for purchase as part of the Historic Anthology 1 bundle. Players may also purchase boosters for non-Standard sets, but the cards from the Historic Anthology Bundle 1 are only available as part of this bundle or by redeeming wildcards.


**What happens if I purchase the bundle after I have crafted some of the cards? Does duplicate protection apply?**


The following duplicate-protection rules apply for players who purchase the bundle after crafting cards:


* You will receive Vault progress for any commons or uncommons beyond the fourth copy in your collection.
* You will receive gems for any rares or mythic rares beyond the fourth copy in your collection: 20 Gems for rares, 40 Gems for mythic rares
