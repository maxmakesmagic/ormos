As some of you might have seen, we sent members of our judge community a set of full-art premium basic lands featuring art by [Terese Nielsen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Terese+Nielsen%22%5D).


These cards are already proving to be quite popular as the community has begun seeing them pop up in the wild. If you attend an event with a judge, be sure to say thanks!
