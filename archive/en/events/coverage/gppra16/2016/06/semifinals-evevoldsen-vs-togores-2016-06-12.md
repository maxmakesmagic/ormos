Before the match, as usual, the players had the chance to look at each other's decklist. Thomas Enevoldsen at first had trouble finding [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond) on Rodrigo Togores' Storm list.


"It's definitely in there," Togores assured his opponent. "My deck is bad, but not that bad. I'm most certainly playing [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)."


"It's probably even better than [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) in your deck, because this way you get to play [Demonic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Tutor)," Enevoldsen replied smartly, referring to the interaction between [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond) and [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor).


That interaction, alongside [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) and [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual) and various card-draw spells, both big and small, was what Togores's deck was all about: Trying to cast as many spells as possible in one turn, then end the game with [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony).


Thomas Enevoldsen, meanwhile, was playing his famous Death and Taxes, an update of the list he had already won a Grand Prix with three years ago. His plan in the matchup would be to throw a wrench into Togores's engine with "hatebears"—2-drop creatures like [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben), [Phyrexian Revoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Revoker), and [Spirit of the Labyrinth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+of+the+Labyrinth), as well as [Ethersworn Canonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist) out of the sideboard.


Going first was a big advantage, even more so than usually, in the clash between these two decks and, due to his better finish in the Swiss rounds, Enevoldsen would be the one to do so ...


### The Games


Enevoldsen opened on [Rishadan Port](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) and [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial), but had no second land, while Togores spent his first two turns fixing his hand with the help of [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), fetch lands, and [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). Eventually, [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) revealed why Enevoldsen had kept his one-land hand: [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben), possibly his strongest card in the matchup.


Thalia made its way onto the battlefield via [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial), and was soon joined by a pair of [Phyrexian Revoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Revoker)s, revoking Togores's right to activate [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal)s and [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond)s. Between the extra tax on his spells and his inability to use eight of his mana generating artifacts, Togores would have a hard time getting his game off the ground.


A pair of [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp)s put further pressure on Togores. "I guess I have to try it," said Togores and cast a [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual), a pair of [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual)s, and a [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) before accepting the inevitable. His stream of cards ended right there and he picked up his cards in concession.

In the second game, Enevoldsen mulliganed into a hand with two lands and two copies of [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben). But it didn't really matter. Togores began his first turn with [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), then fetched a land and cast [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual), [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual), [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual), and [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond), sacrificing the artifact in response to [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam).


This left Togores with three black mana and 17 life at his disposal. He got a massive amount of cards off of [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam), cast another [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual), [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal), another [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond), [Rain of Filth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rain+of+Filth), and sacrificed [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond) in response to [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor). Now empty-handed, Togores was able to search for [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) and even the score.


"It was a turn-two kill, but [with [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe)] I drew the [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) I was missing," said a happy Togores.

*Rodrigo Togores*



In the third and final game of the match, Enevoldsen, playing first, once again had a [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben) for turn two. But once again, the legendary creature never made it to the battlefield. This time, because of Togores's turn-one combination of [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) and [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy).


Enevoldsen could only use his Wasteland on Togores's [Underground Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea), cast [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes), and pass the turn back to Togores.


Togores apparently had no second land, but did have [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal) plus [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) to look at some cards. He did a few calculations, drew off [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), did further calculations, played and cracked a fetch land, and did some more calculating.


Eventually, he cast [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) (3 mana), [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal) (4 mana), [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) revealing [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual) (2 mana), [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual) (5 mana), [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual) (8 mana), [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) empty handed (6 mana), [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) (4 mana), and [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) (0 mana, tenth spell of the turn).


"Yeah, you got it," said Enevoldsen after quickly checking the math. He was impressed. Getting to ten spells without involving anything like [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam) or [Past in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames) was quite unusual for Storm. Enevoldsen offered his hand in concession and wished Togores good luck in the finals ...
