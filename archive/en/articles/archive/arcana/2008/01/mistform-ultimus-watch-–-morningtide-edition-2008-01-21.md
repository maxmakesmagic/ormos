![Mistform Ultimus Watch](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/mistformultimuswatch.jpg)Since the [last official installment](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1176) of the Mistform Ultimus Watch, creature types have become much more important and have also gotten [Grandly Updated](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/424a3). It's also gotten some new friends, but we're not going to start calling this the "Mistform Ultimus and Changeling Update." It's a matter of tradition!

So let's imagine that Mistform Ultimus is sitting down to a formal dinner with [Moonglove Changeling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Changeling), [Taurean Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taurean+Mauler), and [War-Spike Changeling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War-Spike+Changeling).

"So, I understand you're a Weird Jellyfish Illusion," says Mistform.  
 "Indeed I am," responds the Moonglove. "But my friend Taurean is a Mutant Ox Egg."  
 "I say!" interjects the Mauler. "You don't have to say it with that tone of voice! How about some respect? War-Spike is a Mutant Kraken Octopus, and nobody bats an eye at him."  
 War-Spike Changeling just smiles. He knows that Mistform Ultimus is a Goat Spawn Skeleton that would never judge anyone on the contents of their creature type lines.

As of *Morningtide*, Mistform Ultimus (and any Changeling) is a:
