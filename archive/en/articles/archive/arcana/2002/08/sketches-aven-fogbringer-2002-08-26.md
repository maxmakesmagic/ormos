This week's Sketches shows off the *Judgment* common [Aven Fogbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fogbringer) by Ed Beard. Ed has been illustrating Magic cards since *Legends*.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This is a blue card and should show an aven wizard casting a spell with a staff that causes the land below him to be enshrouded in a very thick fog. The focus is the wizard so his clothes should reflect the point that he is a wizard."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Ed. There was a problem in that the *Odyssey*  Styleguide showed three different types of aven, even though the creative team decided to only use one type in card art. Ed's picture came back using one of the other two types of aven, with more human features.

Once the situation was explained to Ed, he resent in his sketch with the more bird-like aven instead.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final piece. 

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today.
