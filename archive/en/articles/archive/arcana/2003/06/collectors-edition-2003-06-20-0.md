Here's a blast from the past. When the first sets of **Magic** (Alpha/Beta) were still in print, Wizards released a boxed set containing all the cards printed in a special format. This set was called the "Collectors' Edition."


From the bottom of the box:


"This special collectors' edition of *Magic: The Gathering* contains all 302 cards from the original **Deckmaster** series of playable trading cards. The complete set is augmented with duplicates of the many land cards, making a total of 363 cards. These cards are produced in a special collectors' format with square-cut corners and gold borders. So pick up the *Magic: The Gathering Collectors' Edition* and explore the whole world in one box."


No, these cards are not tournament legal. But that doesn't mean they aren't valuable. Full Collectors' Editions go for several hundred dollars on the secondary market.
