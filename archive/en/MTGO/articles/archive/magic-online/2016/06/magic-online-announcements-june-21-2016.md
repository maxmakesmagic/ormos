**Legacy Festival "Assemble" Phase: *Eternal Masters* Events**


*Magic Online* has festivals to celebrate a format and its players, as well as to encourage others to join in on the fun. Interested in playing Legacy but haven't given it a try? Already play and want to get your friends to join you? This festival is the time! The Legacy Festival will walk players through the essential steps to discovering a format:


* DISCOVER (JUNE 8–16): A way to try out the format. Learn about the different decks, see what the metagame is like, and find a deck that you want to play.
* ASSEMBLE (JUNE 16–JULY 6): Play the new *Eternal Masters* set for an an opportunity to acquire cards you'll need for your deck.
* CONQUER (JULY 6–JULY 24): Once you've gotten your deck together, a way to play for some sweet prizes when you jump in and take on the competition.

The [*Eternal Masters* "Assemble" phase](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-online-legacy-festival-discover-assemble-conquer-2016-05-13#) of the Legacy Festival is on until the Wednesday, July 6, downtime and is immediately followed up by the "Conquer" phase, as well as the Legacy Festival Championship!

**Reminder: No Downtime on June 22**


In an effort to make sure *Magic Online* is available when you want to play *Magic*, we’re working on ways to reduce the number of times we have to bring the system offline for maintenance. As a first step we’re simply going to eliminate at least one downtime each month.


Here are the dates of the exact downtimes we’ll be skipping through August of 2016:


* June 22
* July 13
* August 3
