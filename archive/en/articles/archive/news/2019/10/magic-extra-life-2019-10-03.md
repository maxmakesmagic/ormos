Wizards of the Coast is once again raising funds for Extra Life, benefitting Seattle Children's Hospital—and you can help!

Uncut Sheet Auctions
====================


Through eBay for Charity at [www.ebay.com/wotccharity](http://www.ebay.com/wotccharity), we'll be auctioning off more than 20 uncut sheets between October 23 and November 2 at 11 p.m. PT. Among the sheets, we'll have a foil *New Phyrexia* rare/mythic rare sheet and a foil *Throne of Eldraine* alternate-art and Showcase card sheet.


Streaming Events
================


We'll have two in-house streams on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) to raise money for Extra Life:


October 28–November 1, 9 a.m.–12 p.m. PT


* Employees take over the Wizards stream to play *MTG* *Arena*, *MTGO*, and generally goof around in the pursuit of charity.

Nov. 2, 4 p.m.–12 a.m. PT


* Our Game Day stream will feature multiple influencers playing *Magic: The Gathering Arena* and competing in "special" challenges. You'll just have to tune in . . .

Creator Campaign
================


Finally, we're holding something of a competition among streamers to raise the most for Extra Life. Interested streamers can create Extra Life pages and join the [*Magic* super team](http://extralife.wizards.com)—competing either alone or in teams of up to six. The Top 8 teams will get access to codes for their audience, featuring an early-access premium card style for [Inspiring Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiring+Veteran).
