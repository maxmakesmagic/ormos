Ready for another story about the heroes of Kamigawa? Check out the [*Champions of Kamigawa* site](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/displayexpansion.asp?set=chk&page=1) for an update in the "Meet the Champions" area.


This week's story is "**[The Dragon's Errand](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/chk/kikijiki)**" by Alexander O. Smith. It's the story of the akki legend Kiki-Jiki got his epithet, "the [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kiki-Jiki%252C%2BMirror%2BBreaker)." Enjoy!


But you're not done yet...


  
The *Champions of Kamigawa* prerelease has come and everybody's had a chance to see the [spoiler](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/cardlist/championsofkamigawa). And by now, you've probably noticed that the [story on October 20](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/displayexpansion.asp?set=chk&page=2&lang=en) is marked by a question mark -- that's because we've been waiting for *you* to tell *us* whose backstory you want to know. Yes, it's time for you to pick which Legend's legend you want told.


We've got a list of ten legends (including two pre-legends, in the form of the new flip cards) for you to choose from. This vote will be up for a week, and then we'll commission an all-new story.


Have fun and choose carefully!
