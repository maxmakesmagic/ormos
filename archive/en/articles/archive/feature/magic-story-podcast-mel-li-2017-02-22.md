Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






This week, we're on episode three of six of the *Magic* Story Podcast, and we're joined by Mel Li, formerly of the creative team (since recording this podcast, she took another opportunity outside of Wizards. Good luck, Mel!). She's here to talk about real-world inspirations for *Kaladesh* and *Aether Revolt*, what makes Rashmi tick, cosplaying, and a giant whiteboard with "Evil Science Fair" written on it. At least that's how it looked in my head.


The *Magic* Story Podcast goes behind the scenes with the people who make the worlds, create the characters, and infuse this game with imagination. We're off next week as we have *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* previews, but we'll return with episode four of six the week after! And if you're wondering about the return of *Magic* Story, the *Amonkhet* season kicks off March 29!
