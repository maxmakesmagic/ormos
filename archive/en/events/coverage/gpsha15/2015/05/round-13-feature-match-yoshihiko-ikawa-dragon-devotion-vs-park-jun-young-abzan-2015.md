Round 13 pitted two magic professionals against each other. On one side sat Park Jun Young, 4 time Grand Prix top 8 competitor. Park was looking to make that 5 this weekend in Shanghai. He had made it thus far with a relatively standard Abzan Aggro deck. There's a reason why the deck is so popular; it has the tools to deal with nearly everything. Sitting with two losses, his back was against the wall needing a few more wins to make top 8.


His opponent, Yoshihiko Ikawa, also sat with two losses. It had been nearly 5 years since his last premier event top 8 when he got 7th place at Pro Tour San Diego. Ikawa brought a creation of his own this weekend--a deck he dubs Dragon Devotion. Similar to the Dragon Metamorph deck that Makihito Mihara and Yuuya Watanabe are playing this weekend, Ikawa opted to play cards like [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) and Nykthos in order to power out his many colors of dragons. With the solid early game of [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) and [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor), Ikawa looked poised to take on Park's Abzan deck.


The Games
=========


Play started slowly between the two players. Park played [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) into [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc), while Ikawa's first major play was a [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar). Silumgar took control of the Roc for a moment, but Park had an answer prepared: [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm).


Things went back and forth between the two players: Ikawa cast [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) and used it to wipe the battlefield; Park used [Hero's Demise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Demise) to remove the planeswalker and followed it up with another [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). Ikawa then used his [Haven of the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haven+of+the+Spirit+Dragon) to return Ugin back to his hand and used it once again to wipe the board.


Park's big finish was a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). On the following turn, he attacked Ugin with it. When Ikawa double blocked with his newly minted [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) and [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), Park used [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) to two-for-on the Japanese Pro.

Still with Ugin in play, Ikawa cast [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental). When Park used his final removal spell to deal with the elemental, Ikawa untapped and cast a second copy of Silumgar, stealing the Rhino and taking the first game.


**Ikawa 1 - 0 Park**


Ikawa had a turbocharged start in the second game: he chained [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) into [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) on the third turn. Unphased, Park had an [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) for the Elemental.


Ikawa got lucky--his Manifested card was a [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor). He used [Self-Inflicted Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Self-Inflicted+Wound) to take out Park's blocker and dropped him to 6.

Park had a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and used it to go back up to 9, but Ikawa untapped, and, thanks to Nykthos, cast a [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka). Atarka removed the [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and sealed the match for Ikawa.


**Yoshihiko Ikawa defeats Park Jun Young 2-0!**
