As end the final draft of the swiss rounds, one thing has become apparent: White hasn't gained any new friends. Percentagewise, less people drafted this color with each successive draft over the weekend. Conversely, a lot of drafters started leaning towards blue in this last draft. This had the effect of lowering the overall win percentage of blue deck, as the color became heavily overdrafted. Green made a resurgence in the win department, for the same reasons: with less people drafting green, there were more quality cards to go around.

And for the last time this Pro Tour, I'll remind all of you at home that all percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent. There were 114 players entering the fourth draft of the swiss rounds. Only the three color combination of Green/Red/White made no appearance during this portion.

 18) R/U/G: 5-9-1 (33.3%), 1 Winless  
 19) B/R/W: 0-2-1 (0%)

Although the top two decks have statistically insignificant numbers, it's still impressive that the top four decks all contain white! As fewer and fewer people drafted the color, the quality of cards available for those who were drafting white increased, which in turn improved the quality of white decks.
