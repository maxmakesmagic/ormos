The Quarterfinals saw the battle of the Moris, with super high school student Katsuhiro Mori taking on world-famous APAC Champion Masaya Mori. Katsuhiro is playing white/blue/black/green and Masaya is playing green/white/blue. Katsuhiro wom the rock-paper-scissors, which seems to be the standard way of determining who starts in Japan, and decides to go first. Quite a few players have been choosing to draw and let the opponent start, but that is usually limited to the slow blue/white/green mirror match up.



Katsuhiro started things off with 1st turn Island, 2nd turn Plains, Galina's Knight. Masaya replies with 2nd turn Benalish Trapper, 3rd turn Nomadic Elf, 5th turn Razorfoot Griffin and 6th turn Harrow. Katsuhiro had not played any more creatures by his 7th turn and conceded. I was startled by this; with 12 life remaining and plenty of mana available surely there could have been some hope for him? Maybe his draft was a shocker or he had just had enough.



The second game saw Katsuhiro elect to draw, giving Masaya the opportunity to get off to a rocking start; 2nd turn Nomadic Elf, 3rd turn Galina's Knight (which was Prohibited), 4th turn Razorfoot Griffin, 5th turn Tower Drake and 6th turn Pincer Spider with kicker. You might be wondering what Katsuhiro did during these turns? Well, not much, to be honest. He cast a turn-four Power Armor and turn-five Phyrexian Reaper, then scooped again. 



This quarterfinal was not made of the sort of intense, down-to-the-wire games you would expect from the Top 8 of a Grand Prix, with both games concluding in under ten minutes.



Final Result: 2-0 Masaya Mori
