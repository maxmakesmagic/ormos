**Newly common cards from *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* will be available in Pauper starting April 19**


Unfortunately, an issue has resulted in the cards that are newly common in *Modern Masters 2017* not being legal in Pauper. This also applies to the commons that will be added to Magic Online Treasure Chests starting March 22.


This will be addressed with the April 19 build. Until that date, these new commons will not be legal in the Pauper format. Players will be able to play them in Pauper beginning April 19.


This wasn’t the experience we wanted to create for Pauper players with this release, and our apologies to those of you who were excited to begin brewing with the new cards right away.

**Build notes**


Duel Scene | Improved display feedback on buttons in the prompt box.


General | Fixed several crashes players could encounter on log in.


Duel Scene | Visual indicator improvements have been made to cards that cause different effects across multiple targets.


Limited | [Monstrous Onslaught](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monstrous+Onslaught) now triggers correctly off of controller’s creatures instead of owner’s creatures when cast via cards such as [Gonti, Lord of Luxury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gonti%2C+Lord+of+Luxury).


Modern | The first ability of [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) now correctly lasts until its controller's next turn.


Modern | Colored mana from two different [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) cards now show separately.


Modern | [Vanish Into Memory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vanish+Into+Memory) now correctly causes the caster to discard.


Modern | [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher)'s triggered ability now only triggers once for each spell that targets it.


Modern | Cards that reduce the costs of other cards, such as [Goblin Electromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Electromancer), now correctly affect alternate costs like buyback and multikicker.


Vintage | Spell copies created by [Eye of the Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+the+Storm) no longer trigger [Eye of the Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+the+Storm).


Vintage | [Natural Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Balance) now allows players with less than four lands to search their libraries.
