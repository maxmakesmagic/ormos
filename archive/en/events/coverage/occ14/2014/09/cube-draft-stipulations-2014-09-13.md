Here are all of the stipulations in play for the Cube Draft with Stipulations:



**Backout Draft – Erin Campbell (Community)**



For the first two booster packs, you will sit at the computer of the member of the opposing team who also has Backout Draft. He or she will do the same for you, and you'll draft cards for each other. For the third booster pack, you will each return to your own computer and draft your own cards.



**Even Keel – Paul Cheon (Community)**



Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into must contain only lands and cards with an even converted mana cost. (There are no restrictions on what you draft.)



**Constructed Player – Frank Lepore (Community)**



Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into must contain a minimum of 60 cards. (There are no restrictions on what you draft.)



**Rare Drafter – Mariah Pagliocco (Community)**



You must draft the highest rarity available (mythic rare if there are any, if not then a rare if there is one, if not then an uncommon if there is one, and if not then a common). For this purpose, only the rarity of the card in the cube matters, not any other versions of a card that may exist.



**Horrible Marksman – Bjorn Andreasson (Community)**



Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into can't contain any Equipment, any Auras, or any card whose rules text includes the word "target". (There are no restrictions on what you actually draft.)



**Disciple of Smashing – Tom Ross (Community)** 



Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into can only contain lands and creatures. (There are no restrictions on what you actually draft.)



**Trip to the Arcade – Sean Plott (Community)**



You must draft the card whose name sounds most like an arcade game. (A coverage team member will be assigned to you to assure that this is adjudicated fairly.)



***Magic* Editor – Scott MacCallum (Community)** 



Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into can have a maximum of 60 total words in their names, including lands. Duplicate words count multiple times. (For example, 17 Mountains count as 17 words. There are no restrictions on what you actually draft.)



**Pauper Player – Matt Gregory (Wizards)**



You must draft the lowest rarity available (a common if there is one, if not then an uncommon if there is one, if not than a regular rare if there is one, and if not then a mythic rare). For this purpose, only the rarity of the card in the cube matters, not any other versions of a card that may exist.



**Well, That's Odd – Dave Humpherys (Wizards)**



Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into must contain only basic lands and cards with an odd converted mana cost. (There are no restrictions on what you actually draft.)



**Zendikar, Born and Raised – Mike Turian (Wizards)** 



Creatures you control can't block, unless an effect would force such a creature to block. (There are no restrictions on what cards you draft or put into your deck.)



**Spellbound – Tom LaPille (Wizards)**



Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into can't contain creature cards. (They can contain cards that somehow become creatures on the battlefield, but can't contain cards with "Creature" in the type line. There are no restrictions on what you actually draft.)



**A-L you need – Aaron Forsythe (Wizards)**



Your main deck and any deck you sideboard into must contain only basic lands and cards whose names start with A through L. (There are no restrictions on what you actually draft.)



**Coward – Ryan Spain (Wizards)**



You must draft the card whose art looks the least threatening. (A coverage team member will be assigned to you assure that this is adjudicated fairly.)



**Backout Draft – Helene Bergeot (Wizards)**



For the first two booster packs, you will sit at the computer of the member of the opposing team who also has Backout Draft. He or she will do the same for you, and you'll draft cards for each other. For the third booster pack, you will each return to your own computer and draft your own cards.



**The Living Guildpact – Worth Wollpert (Wizards)** 



You must draft a multicolored card if able. If there are no multicolored cards, you can draft any card. (Lands are colorless.)
