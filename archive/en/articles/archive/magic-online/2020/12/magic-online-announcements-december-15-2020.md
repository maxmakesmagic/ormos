Modern Super Qualifier Added for Sunday
---------------------------------------


Okay, premier event players—we've heard your feedback and are adding a Modern Super Qualifier to the schedule for this Sunday, December 20, at 7 a.m. PT. This is the first opportunity to use your QPs this season, but if you haven't quite earned enough yet, you can join with Play Points or Event Tickets. Good luck and have fun!

*Commander Legends* has arrived!

Updated Alternative Play Schedule
---------------------------------


The alternative play schedule that was announced in the *Zendikar Rising* set article has changed! Check out the latest schedule below.


* December 23–January 13: ***Vintage Cube***. Another update in, this time with *Commander Legends* cards in the mix. This is easily the most common request we get, so . . . we hear you. More *Vintage Cube*. This will last for a few weeks, until . . .
* January 13–20: **A brand-new addition to the Spotlight Cube Series**. As usual, more details will come later, but this one promises to be a wheel of a good time.
* January 20–28: ***Vintage Masters* Flashback**. One of the most popular Draft formats of all time is back to round out *Zendikar Rising* season. We'll have a little more than a week of that, and then . . . well, it's not quite time to talk about *Kaldheim* just yet.

Showcase Qualifiers
-------------------


Players who earned entry into the Showcase Qualifier will be squaring off for an invitation to the Champions Showcase. The entry fee for Showcase Qualifiers is a format token that matches the format of the Showcase. As with QPs, after the season's Showcase Qualifiers are finished, all unused Format Tokens will be removed from players' accounts. Each Showcase Qualifier is a scheduled Swiss-style event with a Top 8 playoff. The winner of each Showcase Qualifier earns a spot in the final Showcase event and a chance to earn their share of $70,000 and an upcoming Premier Event invitation.


Showcase Qualifiers are scheduled as follows:





| **DATE** | **TIME** | **EVENT** | **FORMAT** | **INVITATION** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Saturday, December 19, 2020 | 10:00 a.m. | Vintage Showcase Qualifier | Vintage | Season 3 Showcase |
| Sunday, December 20, 2020 | 9:00 a.m. | Limited Showcase Qualifier | ZNR Sealed | Season 3 Showcase |
| Sunday, December 26, 2020 | 8:00 a.m. | Modern Showcase Qualifier | Modern | Season 3 Showcase |
| Sunday, December 27, 2020 | 8:00 a.m. | Legacy Showcase Qualifier | Legacy | Season 3 Showcase |

*Commander Legends* Phantom Queue Ending
----------------------------------------


Due to a lack of participation in the Phantom queue, we'll be closing the league on Monday, December 21, at 10 a.m. PT. This means no new entries will be allowed after that point, however, the regular League will remain open.
