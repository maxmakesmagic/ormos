My last three FNMs - Nottingham, England. Osaka, Japan. And now Sao Paulo, Brazil. Not that these happened on consecutive Fridays - that would be insane - but it's nonetheless an indicator of how lucky I am to be travelling the world watching the game I love.

*FNM in Action*

In Nottingham, I got handed a Blue-Black control deck that somebody as 'Spike' as I am should never be let near. I confess that I enjoyed going 5-0 rather more than a kindly Uncle Rich figure really should. Truth to tell, it's been a long time since I've had that much fun.


Then there was my Japanese episode, complicated by the fact that it was *M12* Draft, days after the set had been released, and using (I still don't know why they did this on the eve of Japanese Nationals in Japan) Japanese cards. Somehow I cobbled together a Blue-White control deck full of high-toughness speed bumps and tough to kill flyers, plus the small matter of three copies of [Elixir of Immortality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality). Even the really good Red-Black deck couldn't get over the humps I kept putting in the way, and that was a ridiculous 3-0.


And so to Brazil, and back to Standard. I travel light, and I always think it's much more fun to be given a 'random' deck anyway. On this occasion, the store owner was kind enough to give me a 'souped-up' version of the *New Phyrexia* Event Deck that has a turn two kill in it.


Wait, it has a what?


Practicing for a few minutes with the deck, I was rather excited by casting [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf) on turn one, and then laying a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) followed up by [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell)-[Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell)-[Mutagenic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth) on turn two. This seemed like an exceptionally fine way to play *Magic*.

*Thiago Jachelli*

Of course, things don't always work out that way in the field. I began with a match against Thiago Jachelli, who quickly showed me how problematic things were going to get by dumping almost his entire hand into play on turn one. Since he was playing [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel), I couldn't really blame him for this. [Steel Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer) was my undoing in game one, along with a variety of large flyers - which [Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) and [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) aren't supposed to be.


Game two was a bit more interesting when I was able to use [Green Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) to get [Viridian Corrupter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Corrupter), destroying his only blocker and stealing [Contested War Zone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) as a result, but it still wasn't really close. Ho hum.


Then I got to play some of the best (most fun) *Magic* I've had the chance to play in a long while. Against Leonardo, playing [Valakut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut), I won game one pretty easily, despite an early maindeck [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) taking out my [Ichorclaw Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorclaw+Myr) when [Primal Bellow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Bellow) had made it huge.

*Leonardo Martins*

Game two was soooo dumb, in all the right ways. On the play, Leonardo cast [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast) on turn two. Hmm. All my guys lose Infect. That's awkward. I cast [Rot Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rot+Wolf) and hit him for two. And another two. Then I cast [Putrefax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefax) and put him to nine. He cast [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), and fetched up two [Valakut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut)s.


OK then. [Vines of Vastwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vines+of+Vastwood) with Kicker, [Mutagenic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth), [Rot Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rot+Wolf) now an 8/8, cast [Apostle's Blessing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Apostle%27s+Blessing) to let it sneak past the Titan, put him to one. I was still on twenty. Then I died.


He attacked with his Titan, fetched two [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s, dealt all twelve to my face. I valiantly stuck [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) in the way of the Titan, in case he was looking to [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) me out. He wasn't. Two trample damage from the Titan took me to six, and his land for the turn [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) was the last six direct to the dome. An awesome game.

*Prizes!*

From there it was all downhill. I had my own Melira for his in game three, but he once again dealt all twenty in a single turn with [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) and [Valakut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut). 0-2. Ho hum once more. At least I was getting my Participation Points...


I won round three when my opponent Jonny failed to find anything good quickly enough with his [Valakut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut) deck, and ended up at 1-2. I would have played the final round, but needed to be fresh as a daisy this morning to bring you good people all the fun of Nationals.


As always, FNM provided some great people, a great atmosphere, some fun *Magic*, and memories to take away. Oh, and it also provided a Portugese *New Phyrexia* booster. Now, I wonder what country I can play FNM in next...
