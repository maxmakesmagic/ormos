*Sometimes you need to draw the perfect card. What's the best topdeck you've ever made?*


**Matt Place:** My favorite topdeck of all time was way way back in 1995. I was in a tournament at my school, University of Missouri–Rolla. This tournament was a very big deal to me because Zak Dolan, our first **Magic** World Champion, was in the tournament. Zak lost in the Semifinals and I was now in the Finals facing the guy who just beat the world champ. I really wanted to win this.



![Chaos Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chaos+Orb)

Late in the final game I had [The Abyss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Abyss) and some [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s, but my opponent had just attacked me down from 14 to 8 with three Mishra's Factories. I was losing badly. The cards I had left in my deck that could kill [Mishra's Factory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory) were [Nevinyrral's Disk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nevinyrral%27s+Disk), [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), and [Strip Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strip+Mine). None of these helped much—Disk was too slow since it comes into play tapped, and [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and [Strip Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strip+Mine) only dealt with one of the three threats.


The one other card I had that could kill a [Mishra's Factory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory) was [Chaos Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Orb), which I, of course, drew that very next turn. I played it instantly—I didn't want to give my opponent any chance to move his Mishra's Factories any further apart (the rules back then said that once someone announces [Chaos Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Orb) you can not move any of your cards). It didn't look like I could hit all three Mishra's, they were fairly far apart, but my only chance was to try.


I activated the Orb and dropped it, and it fell in the one perfect spot where it barely touched all three. The thirty or so people watching the game erupted and I felt great, especially since I knew the **Magic** World Champ was one of them!
