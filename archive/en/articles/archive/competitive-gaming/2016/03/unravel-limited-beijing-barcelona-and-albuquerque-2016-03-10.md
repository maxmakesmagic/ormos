Unravel the mysteries of *Shadows over Innistrad* Limited, and uncover the depths of the new set in some premier play offerings that will leave you delirious with excitement!


Once you're done seeing what the brand-new set has to offer at a *Shadows over Innistrad* Prerelease near you (April 2!), how about exploring the new set with a few thousand of your fellow *Magic* players all over the world? Read on to see where you'll be able to take part in the world's first weekend of *Shadows over Innistrad* premier play fun.


Grand Prix Madness: Beijing, Albuquerque, and Barcelona
=======================================================


Your first chance to play with *Shadows over Innistrad* at a Grand Prix will be on the weekend of April 15–17 at one of three GPs taking place across three continents. Beijing in Asia, Albuquerque in North America, and Barcelona in Europe will all play host to Grand Prix that will spotlight *Shadows over Innistrad* Sealed Deck and Booster Draft in their respective two-day main tournaments. Each tournament has a $50,000 prize pool, meaning that a grand total of $150,000 will be awarded across three continents and three tournaments in one weekend!


Players who preregister and play in the Grand Prix have an opportunity to receive an event-exclusive playmat. This weekend also marks a little change in the GP playmats—there is one piece of art used across one weekend. Participate in a global Grand Prix bash, and represent your location with a playmat featuring your Grand Prix's logo.

This is something you will see going forward. Also, notice the art. Isn't that a pivotal moment in the *Shadows over Innistrad* story? Hmm...I wonder if this is also something we may be seeing more...it's not like I'll be showing you a lot more playmats on March 24 or something, right?


How you get a Grand Prix playmat differs between each event, so I highly suggest checking out the [GP Beijing](http://www.pandaevents.cn/en/), [GP Albuquerque](http://www.gpabq.com/), and [GP Barcelona](http://magic.tournamentcenter.eu/) websites for more information on how you can obtain your playmat, featuring artwork from the card Declaration in Stone.

While you're checking out the website for the Grand Prix closest to you, I also strongly suggest preregistering if you are planning to go. Preregistering is often a way to potentially get that playmat, and sometimes even discounts on the participation fee. More importantly though, preregistering reserves your seat in the main event, as capacity for the main event is limited, and if the seats sell out, then you may end up out of luck. Don't wait if you're planning to go, and be sure to preregister first and foremost before booking the rest of your travel.


What's Coming Up Before Then
============================


Of course, the next Grand Prix triple weekend isn't coming for another few weeks. We've still got two Grand Prix and a Prerelease before then.


***Magic Online*** **Pro Tour Qualifiers**


The new season of *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifiers (PTQs) has begun. Players will be able to compete in Constructed and Limited Preliminary PTQs. Go 4-1 or better in a Preliminary, and you'll earn a Finals Token that grants you entry into a Finals PTQ during the season.


Finals PTQs during this season award an invitation to Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*, taking place in Sydney, Australia, August 5–7, along with an opportunity to compete in a Pro Tour Challenge event on Sunday at the Pro Tour.


The first Preliminary PTQs take place today, with three Standard and two Sealed Preliminaries. Tomorrow features six Standard and four Sealed Preliminaries, and then two Standard and four Sealed Preliminaries on Saturday. The PTQ Finals Standard tournament of the week takes place March 12 at 9 a.m. PT. The Limited PTQ Finals take place Sunday, March 13, at 7 a.m. PT.


For full information on *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifiers, check out the [event information page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-pro-tour-qualifiers) for event details as well as the schedule for this season's PTQs.


**Grand Prix Washington, D.C.**


While folks continue to preregister for a triple Grand Prix weekend, thousands of players are getting ready for a different kind of Grand Prix based around threes.


Grand Prix Washington, D.C., just recently increased their main event maximum capacity to support up to 1,800 teams of three (5,400 players!), which is sure to make this an event to remember.


Marc Calderaro and Corbin Hosler will be providing the latest updates, articles, and more from the tournament floor, which you'll be able to find on the [Grand Prix Washington, D.C., coverage page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpdc16) starting Saturday. In addition to that, Brian David-Marshall and camera operator David Wright will be at Grand Prix Washington, D.C., recording video segments with various teams throughout the weekend. You'll be able to find those video segments via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic), with longer videos being posted to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/wizardsmtg/) and the coverage page. Look for them!

**Grand Prix Paris**


Paris will play host to the last Grand Prix of the first season in 2016. This is also the last event that offers invitations to [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi), so if you're looking to join us in Madrid, Spain, April 22–24, this is your final opportunity to earn your seat!
