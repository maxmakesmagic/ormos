Incinerate has been getting a lot of attention thanks to [Selecting Tenth Edition](/en/node/642121) announcing its return to Standard next year. In the final sketch vote from that promotion, Zoltan Boros & Gabor Szikszai dominated the poll, taking over 80% of the vote. The final version of their [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) is now here in the office, so today we're able to give you a look at the piece's journey from sketch to completed illustration.

The artists even included an animated file to tie the whole thing together. [Click here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1181_Incinerateanim.gif) to start it.


Special thanks to Zoltan and Gabor for sharing their process with us. You'll get to see how it looks on actual *Tenth Edition* cards starting Summer '07. In the meantime, keep watching **magicthegathering.com** as more Selecting *Tenth Edition* final pieces arrive here at Wizards of the Coast.
