The April 24, 2017 Update
=========================

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 24, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) and [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top)—[slowly being banned (or restricted) from every format ever](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/april-24-2017-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2017-04-24). Also [Gush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gush) is there too. We'll pour one out for you all in Commander.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> I think there's a ton of backlash because the previous format was bad, but we really dont know if this one is bad. They know more than we do

There are a lot of wide, varying opinions on today's [banned and restricted announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/april-24-2017-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2017-04-24), but Paulo's tweet managed to capture both sides of the coin. The key part from Aaron Forsythe's article today:


*We have not seen the movement in the format we had hoped for with the Grand Prix in the latter half of the season, but we still believe we need to gather more data—particularly with an eye toward the effect of* Amonkhet *on the Pro Tour.* Amonkhet *has a number of exciting and powerful cards, both proactive and reactive, and too much can change with the introduction of that set. We don't want to ban something that might ultimately not have been a problem, or, worse, create a potentially worse problem due to lack of information. We need to let the players loose on this format and hope things turn out well—an outcome we believe is possible. However, if that does not happen, we will re-evaluate the situation a few weeks after the Pro Tour.*

Sure, it's going to get lost in the noise today from our first item, but this weekend was all about people posting about their *Amonkhet* Prerelease. It seemed like people had a great time, generally speaking. Plenty of people showed their [jealousy-inducing pulls](https://twitter.com/Marshall_LR/status/856307722454618112), others their [fun-loving owners](https://i.redd.it/v3fjoyupkdty.jpg), and yet others just shared how cool it was [to attend the event for the first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/675c34/4_days_ago_i_asked_the_sub_tips_for_me_and_my/).


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [The Goodbye Bracket](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/thegirlfriendbracket-04222017-the-girlfriend-bracket-100-the-goodbye-bracket/) | The Girlfriend Bracket | Erin Campbell, Hallie Santo, Katie Neal, and Kriz Schultz

I missed this on Friday purely due to bad timing, but I couldn't let the final episode of The Girlfriend Bracket pass without acknowledging their work over the 100 episodes of their podcast. It's been two years of talking about *Magic*, so let's take a moment to appreciate what they've done. Thank you Erin, Hallie, Katie, and Kriz—you'll be missed.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Amonkhet* Constructed Set Review: White](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/aliaintrazi-04242017-amonkhet-set-review-white/) | Gathering Magic | Ali Aintrazi

It's a simple, time-tested formula: go card-by-card through one color, rate each card, say a little bit about its applications or potential applications, finish with a ranking of some kind, and voila, set review!


If you're looking for more set reviews and have StarCityGames.com premium, Patrick Chapin started [his Constructed review today as well, with black.](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34971_Amonkhet-Complete-Review-Black.html)


1. [*Amonkhet* 2: Electric Brew-galoo](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34973_Amonkhet-2-Electric-Brew-galoo.html) | StarCityGames.com | Chris Lansdell

Lansdell does what Lansdell does best—brew a bunch of decks across a variety of archetypes, all with a bit of zing to them. Yes, zing.


1. [Victor Adame Mínguez Rules](http://muddycolors.blogspot.mx/2017/04/victor-adame-minguez-rules.html) | Muddy Colors | Jesper Ejsing and Victor Adame Mínguez

Victor Adame Mínguez, who created both [Vizier of the Menagerie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+the+Menagerie) and [Anointed Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointed+Procession) for *Amonkhet* (among others), explains his process behind [Anointed Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointed+Procession). It has the art description, some drawings that show steps along the way, the artist himself explaining the process—what more could an art aficionado want?


And if you want even more art today? Noah Bradley was kind enough to [share his process](https://imgur.com/gallery/VOPKm) for [Cradle of the Accursed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cradle+of+the+Accursed).


1. [Highlights from *Amonkhet*](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/simon-nielsen/highlights-from-amonkhet) | MTG Mint Card | Simon Nielsen

Nielsen highlights some obvious and not-so-obvious cards from *Amonkhet* that he thinks will break out, plus some idle musings on possible new combos and synergies. No word yet on my [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon)-[Bloodrage Brawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrage+Brawler) concept.


1. [As the Wurm Turns](http://www.cranialinsertion.com/article/2289) | Cranial Insertion | Nathan Long

This rules-focused article looks squarely at *Amonkhet* and says "I got you, fam."


I'm 99% sure I'm using that incorrectly. The kids these days and their slang.


What to Watch Today? Tomorrow? I'm not really sure
==================================================


1. > 
> [@blakepr](https://twitter.com/blakepr) new event we are running for Aussie content creators :) [pic.twitter.com/aDscopZBK5](https://t.co/aDscopZBK5)

So, a group of Australian *Magic* content creators (see above) are getting together to run an event at 7 p.m. AEST on April 25. Considering it's already April 25 there, [it must be happening sometime today](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS724US724&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=what+time+is+it+in+australia). I think. I don't know, it's the future. Everything streams on [twitch.tv/mtgaustream](https://www.twitch.tv/mtgaustream).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Red-Green Monsters](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/rg-monsters-with-amonkhet/) | ChannelFireball | Andrea Mengucci

Mengucci just wants to smash, and he's found a monstrous deck with which to do so in *Amonkhet* Standard. It's a no-holds-barred approach to beating down, with just a bunch of mana creatures, efficient monsters, and not much else. Because why would you need much else when they're dead?


[Glorybringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer), [Rhonas the Indomitable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhonas+the+Indomitable), and [Channeler Initiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channeler+Initiate) are the big additions to the deck—and I do mean big. Play ramp creatures, play giant monsters, smash. There's nothing cleaner.
