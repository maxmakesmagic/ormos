Owl? Crow? Seagull? Not funny.


Chicken? Instant funny.


One of the running themes in *Unglued* is chickens. There are more of the traditionally funny fowl in the set than you might think, however: they appear not just in the type line, but also in *Unglued* art (especially that of Kaja Foglio), flavor text, and rules text. Here's a list of *Unglued* cards that support the chicken theme. Also, click the pictures at right for high-resolution images of some finger-lickin' chicken art.
