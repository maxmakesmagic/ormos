![Harrier Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Harrier+Griffin)What could impede a guild determined to satisfy its every sadistic desire? What force could rise up to oppose a demon-led guild of over-the-top miscreants? *What stops Rakdos?*
Could it be… white spells?


It’s common for the art of a creature-affecting card to depict a creature aligned with the spell’s enemy colors as the victim of the spell. [Echoing Decay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay) depicts white-aligned leonin warriors getting whacked, while [Awe Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awe+Strike) shows a black-aligned nim zombie taking the brunt.


In *Ravnica*, enemy colors means rival guilds. And black-red Rakdos’s natural enemy is the color white.


We’ve [already seen](/en/articles/archive/guildpacts-peeks-dissension-guilds-2006-04-13) that [Harrier Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrier+Griffin) shows a Rakdos warrior getting munched by the eponymous griffin. But there are more Rakdos cameos. 


*Ravnica’s* [Devouring Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Light) shows a minor Rakdos demon shriveling under the holy blast of energy of the spell, for example. See the characteristic design of the skull armor, and the multiple horns?

*Dissension’s* splashy removal spell [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) shows a burly Rakdos cultist humbled by the swift judgment of an Azorius ruling.

There’s even a touch of Rakdos showing up in [Plumes of Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plumes+of+Peace). As artist Justin Sweet shows, it’s tough to swing your bloodstained sword—or even see your target—with all those irritating doves around. Blasted lawmages!
