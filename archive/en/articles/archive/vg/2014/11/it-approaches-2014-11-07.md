This weekend features the first lull in the *Magic* premier play stream schedule for the next couple of weeks. However, in less than four weeks, we'll be delving into the biggest week of *Magic* coverage for the year.

Worlds Week, featuring the World Championship and the World *Magic* Cup, begins on December 2. That is Day One of the 2014 World Championship, where 24 of the world's best players will compete for *Magic*'s biggest title.



The 2014 World Championship coverage begins on December 2 and 3 at 9 a.m. local time/12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET/8 a.m. GMT.


Then, after a one-day break, coverage begins again with the 2014 World *Magic* Cup. The tournament features teams of four from 72 countries comprised of each nation's best players battling for fame, fortune, and national pride.


Coverage for the World *Magic* Cup begins on December 5 at 10 a.m. local time/1 a.m. PT/4 a.m. ET/9 a.m. GMT, and again on December 6 at those same times.


Then, on Sunday, December 7, watch the playoffs for both of these events as we showcase matches that often comprise of *Magic*'s greatest moments. Start time for coverage on the fifth and final day of Worlds Week is 9 a.m. local time/12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET/8 a.m. GMT. Don't miss it! You can find every minute of Worlds Week action on the  [*Magic* Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/magic)  channel.


Looking to fill the time between now and Worlds Week? While there are no Grand Prix taking place this weekend, there's still fresh content for you to check out!

The [Vintage Super League](http://vintagesuperleague.com/)'s inaugural season is nearing a close. In the second week of the playoff, Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas will battle against Eric Froehlich in the 75-card Sultai-fueled [Fastbond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fastbond) mirror match to see who will move on to face Steve Menendian and his Blue-Red Delver deck in the finals. It's best two out of three *matches*, so anything can happen. Who will move on to compete against the Delver menace?



Join host Randy Buehler with guest commentary from the competitors on Tuesday, November 11, at 7 p.m. PT/10 p.m. ET/2 a.m. GMT to see the matches play out live!

The second week of the Swedish Super Cup highlights the remaining two matches for the first-round quarterfinals, where the competitors will battle with their favorite Standard decks from *Magic* history!



This Sunday, Olle RÃ¥de will compete against Elias Watsfeldt, and Anton Jonsson squares off against Mattias Jorstedt. You can see what each of these competitors have chosen to play with on the [SvMTV website](http://www.svmtv.org/quarterfinals-3-and-4/).


The matches begin at the [SvMTV Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/svmtv) on Monday, November 10, at 12 p.m. PT/3 p.m. ET/8 p.m. GMT.

Looking to watch some Standard and Legacy in action? The SCGLive crew's got you covered this weekend. The [StarCityGames.com](http://www.starcitygames.com/) Open Series makes a stop in Columbus, Ohio, this weekend. The last Open Series in Oakland caused a stir in both formats, with Ivan Jen's Jeskai Heroic Combo deck causing Standard commotion and Joseph Moreno's Dredge reminding Legacy Delver players that ignoring [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) and pals can have consequences.



With both formats shaken up, how will the players in Columbus adjust?


Join hosts Patrick Sullivan and Cedric Phillips on the [SCGLive Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/scglive) channel as they bring you live coverage for both the Standard and Legacy Open this weekend. Coverage for the Standard Open begins on Saturday at 7:30 a.m. PT/10:30 a.m. ET/3:30 p.m. GMT. Coverage resumes on Sunday at 5 a.m. PT/8 a.m. ET/1 p.m. GMT for the Standard Open Top 8, and Legacy Open coverage will begin shortly after.
