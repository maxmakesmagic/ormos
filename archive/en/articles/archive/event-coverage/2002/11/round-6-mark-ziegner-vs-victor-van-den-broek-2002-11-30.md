![Hermit Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hermit+Druid)Victor is playing an updated version of his Angry Ghoul deck he and his teammates played at Pro Tour Houston, where he failed to make day 2. He's been doing a lot better today, both he and Mark are on 5-0. Mark is playing a Blue/White Rebel deck featuring a lot of techy cards and an [Enlightened Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor) sideboard.### Game 1

Victor chose to play the first game and after some deliberation decided to keep his hand. Mark simply nodded and kept as well. Victor had a turn 1 [Hermit Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermit+Druid) and Mark could only frown:

"Why'd you think that long..."

Victor not only had the druid but the [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) as well so he milled his whole deck turn 2 and [Reclaim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclaim)ed 2 [Exhume](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume)s. Mark's [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) wasn't really up to the task of stopping a 40/40 Trampler so he wisely conceded.

"So you're playing...plains."

Vic decides to go for a safe plan of just boarding in his [Sickening Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Dreams) to get rid of annoying [Whipcorder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipcorder)s and the like.

Mark boarded [Reprisal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reprisal)s, [Topple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topple)s, some Tutors and a [Seal of Removal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Removal).

### Game 2

Mark played first and kept his hand again. Vic had to mulligan a hand consisting of over 20 power and toughness worth of creatures and no real business spells. His second hand is a bunch of land a [Hermit Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermit+Druid), an [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) and a [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and he decided to keep. A [Mox Diamond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond) off the top gave him another nice start of turn 1 Druid.

![Sutured Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sutured+Ghoul)Mark then showed his first spell of the match with an [Enlightened Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor) for [Seal of Removal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Removal). Vic gave a little smile and nodded. The Seal came out the turn after ready to bounce any incoming fatties. The [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) gave Vic a [Reanimate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) and more food for thought as the [Seal of Removal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Removal) on the board can cause a lot of problems.As long as Mark doesn't have any significant pressure, it really won't help him much though. A [Reanimate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) on a [Petradon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petradon) spelled some more trouble for Mark as he apparently ran out of land and he was unwilling to bounce the [Petradon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petradon) just yet. He bounced it in Vic's attack phase with a little cheer that may or may not have been sarcastic:

"Whoo, I have permanents."

Vic gave the go ahead and Mark drew, having not played a creature as of yet. He did manage a third land, an [Adarkar Wastes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Wastes). Vic mills the rest of his deck at the end of Mark's turn and [Reclaim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclaim)s a single [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). The [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) nabs a [Reprisal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reprisal), Mark's only out against the huge [Sutured Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sutured+Ghoul) in Victor's graveyard. The crappy rare turns into a 30/30 monster giving the game and match to Victor.

**Final Result:** van den Broek 2 - Ziegner 0

As it turned out Mark simply forgot to play the [Adarkar Wastes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Wastes) on his turn. If he had, he could've played a [True Believer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True+Believer) disabling Victor's [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and allowing him to [Reprisal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reprisal) whatever Victor would [Reanimate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) on turn 4. Even the pro's can make mistakes sometimes.
