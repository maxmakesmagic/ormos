Did you enjoy the *Gatecrash* Prerelease? Great! Now let's jump forward a few months and talk about what's going to happen at the *Dragon's Maze* Prerelease, because it's not going to be exactly like *Gatecrash* and *Return to Ravnica*.


Here's what's different:


### All Ten Guilds


When you walk in to a *Dragon's Maze*  Prerelease, you'll get to select your favorite guild from among all of the ten guilds of Ravnica! That guild pack will have a secret allied guild, which will share one color with your chosen guild, and also always be from the opposite set as your chosen guild.


So let’s look at an example: You’re a Dimir player, so that’s the guild you pick. That guild pack might have *Return to Ravnica*'s Azorius as its secret ally (although it could also be Izzet, Rakdos, or Golgari). That guild pack would have four *Dragon's Maze* booster packs, one *Gatecrash* Dimir guild Prerelease pack, and one *Return to Ravnica* Azorius guild Prerelease pack. The two guild packs will be the same as they were in their original Prerelease, but will not have that set's Prerelease promo for those guilds. The guild Prerelease packs will not contain a Spindown life counter, sticker, or guild welcome letter.

### One Prerelease Card


Everyone who plays in a *Dragon's Maze* Prerelease will get the same alternate-art promo foil card, while supplies last. This card will *not* be playable in your Prerelease deck.


### The Maze


There's also a maze! Players (that's you) will work collectively to advance their chosen guild through the Implicit Maze each round. There are prizes for each guild that gets all the way through the maze, and special prizes for the first guild that does it. And when the maze is completed, all participating players will receive a premium (foil) basic land promo card!

### No Basic Land in *Dragon's Maze* Booster Packs


Wait... that sounds kind of negative. Let's rephrase it.


### *Dragon's Maze* Booster Packs All Contain Nonbasic Lands


That's better! The fifteenth card in all *Dragon's Maze* packs isn't basic land; it's nonbasic land. All ten guildgates will be showing up (with the *Dragon's Maze* expansion symbol), as will all ten shocklands from *Return to Ravnica* and *Gatecrash* (with their *Return to Ravnica* or *Gatecrash* symbols). You are about half as likely to open a shockland in *Dragon's Maze* as in *Return to Ravnica* and *Gatecrash* and, since this is for all ten shocklands rather than five, that means you are about a quarter as likely to open a specific one. There's also a mythic rare land from *Dragon's Maze* that will show up there sometimes!
