Congratulations Nathan Steuer, Two-Time MOCS Showcase Champion!
---------------------------------------------------------------


Eight top *Magic Online* players battled in *Modern Cube* and Pioneer formats for a $70,000 prize pool and two invitations to the 2023 *Magic* World Championship.


Kiran Dhokia (cherryxman) punched his ticket to the World Championship with a sweep of *Modern Cube* rounds with a Rakdos Aggro build. Then Nathan Steuer (nathansteuer) joined Kiran in the finals by completing a 3–0 run in Pioneer with Izzet Phoenix. In the end, Steuer grabbed his second Showcase win in the past twelve months with a two-game Pioneer triumph over Dhokia.


Check out all of the coverage at [magic.gg](https://magic.gg/events/2022-magic-online-champions-showcase-season-2). Congratulations to Nathan and the other competitors this weekend!


The next MOCS Showcase will be held on Saturday, January 21, and will feature *Vintage Cube* and Modern. You can qualify for this event—find out how on the [Premier Play info page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/2022-magic-online-premier-play-program).

Banned List Update
------------------


As announced in [yesterday's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/october-10-2022-banned-and-restricted-announcement), two cards have been added to the Banned List for Modern and Standard:


**Standard**:


[The Meathook Massacre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Meathook+Massacre) is banned.


**Modern**:


[Yorion, Sky Nomad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yorion%2C+Sky+Nomad) is banned.


These changes took effect in *Magic Online* yesterday, and all players with those cards in their League decks at the time of the banning have had those League courses ended with the entry options returned.

Chrome-atic Chaos Draft October 12–18
-------------------------------------


Chrome-atic Chaos Drafts offer a mashup of multicolor and artifact sets, and players can join in starting tomorrow, October 12, through October 18. Entry options are 10 Event Tickets or 100 Play Points. This is a Phantom draft—cards won't be added to players' collections.


**PLEASE NOTE**: This League will end at Tuesday's downtime—one fewer day to play than normal.


In the draft, boosters from eighteen different expansions are available. There are two copies of each booster in the virtual grab bag. With 24 packs being randomly selected by the system for each eight-player draft, it's a new experience every time!


The expansions available to draft include:


* *Invasion*, *Planeshift*, and *Apocalypse*
* *Ravnica: City of Guilds*, *Guildpact*, and *Dissension*
* *Return to Ravnica*, *Gatecrash*, and *Dragon's Maze*
* *Shards of Alara*, *Conflux*, and *Alara Reborn*
* *Mirrodin*, *Darksteel*, and *Fifth Dawn*
* *Scars of Mirrodin*, *Mirrodin Besieged*, and *New Phyrexia*

*Modern Cube* Ends Tomorrow
---------------------------


Players have one more full day to enjoy *Modern Cube* while they still can! We'll have both a regular Phantom Draft League and Single-Elimination Draft for a two-week run, just like always.


Be sure to check out [the *Modern Cube* update article from Carmen Handy and Aaron Sorrells](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/modern-cube-magic-online-september-2022-09-27) and [the latest changes to the *Modern Cube* card list](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/modern-cube-cardlist).

Showcase Challenge Weekend
--------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend.


These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and invitations to the 2023 World Championship!


On Saturday, October 15, we have the Modern Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC), and on Sunday, October 16, we have the Pioneer Showcase Challenge at 6 a.m. PT (13:00 UTC).


Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in December.
