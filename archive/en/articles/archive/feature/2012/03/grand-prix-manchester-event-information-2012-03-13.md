A Grand Prix Manchester is in the centre of town, you'll be able to experience it all—home of two of the UK's greatest football teams, it also has a thriving nightlife and some awesome attractions. 


Getting to and from Manchester is also very simple as its international airport connects to most major European cities. Also, you can arrive via the train by traveling on Eurostar to London and getting a direct train to Manchester. 



*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).

* [Day 2 and Top 8: Booster Draft](/en/node/704561) (1 pack of *Dark Ascension*, 2 packs of *Innistrad* drafted in that order)
* Deck lists are required.
* If product is not stamped or preregistered, deck registration and deck swap will be performed for the Swiss Sealed Deck.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

 The Head Judges for this event will be Kevin Desprez and Carlos Ho.

### Travel Information


**Arriving by Plane**
  
 Manchester International Airport is under 10 miles from the event venue taking approximately 25 minutes by taxi, or alternatively there is a direct half-hourly express rail service to the city centre that takes approximately 20 minutes.


**Arriving by Train/Metrolink**
  
 Manchester has direct rail connections to all major UK cities – London is just over two hours away by train. Services come into the city at either Piccadilly or Victoria station, both of which connect to Manchester’s Metrolink light-rail system which provides easy access to all parts of the city centre. Take the Metrolink from either Piccadilly or Victoria (in the Altrincham or Eccles direction) and alight at St Peter’s Square, which is within a 5-minute walk of Manchester Central. You can also take advantage of the free Metroshuttle bus that travels between the two stations across the city centre. 


**Arriving by Car**
  
 Manchester is at the heart of the Northwest’s motorway network with easy access from all directions onto the M60, the city’s orbital motorway. Once on the M60 exit at Junction 12 and join the M602 signposted towards the city centre. Follow the A57 straight on from the end of the M602 passing under a railway bridge before taking the left hand exit to merge onto the A56 Bridgewater Way. Turn right onto Whitworth Street West at Deansgate station and then turn left onto Albion Street. The entrance to the Manchester Central Car Park is through the next set of traffic lights on the left, opposite The Bridgewater Hall.


If you are using sat nav, type in M2 3GX which will take you to the car park at Manchester Central.
