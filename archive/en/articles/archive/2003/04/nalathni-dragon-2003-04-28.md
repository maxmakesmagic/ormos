One Dragon that doesn't fit the normal mold is the rarely-seen [Nalathni Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nalathni+Dragon):


The card was created as a giveaway for the [Dragon\*Con](http://www.dragoncon.org/) convention in 1994 (hence the dragon expansion symbol). It was also distributed in *The Duelist* #3 (much to the annoyance of people that paid/traded heavily for them after Dragon\*Con).


Not only is [Nalathni Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nalathni+Dragon) the smallest Dragon ever made, it also has the very out-of-flavor ability of banding (and is the only red creature with the ability).


Nalathni Dragon is legal in Type 1 tournaments. The card's Oracle text:


**Nalathni Dragon**

If this ability is played four or more times during this turn, sacrifice Nalathni Dragon at end of turn.
