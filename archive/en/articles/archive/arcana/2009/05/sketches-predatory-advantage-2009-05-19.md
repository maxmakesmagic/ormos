Welcome to another edition of Sketches! Today we look at the process behind illustrating that potentially unending source of lizards, [Predatory Advantage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predatory+Advantage)!

### Artist Background

Artist [Raymond Swanland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Raymond%20Swanland%22%5D) started illustrating **Magic** cards in *Future Sight*, then became one of the go-to guys for Jund starting with *Shards of Alara*. His process has already been showcased in [this edition of Sketches](/en/articles/archive/sketches-predator-dragon-2008-10-30), showing off his magnificent [Predator Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator+Dragon).

### Art Description

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions given to Raymond for Predatory Advantage:


> *'Color: Red and green spell  
>  Location: Naya  
>  Action: In Jund the alligator-like Viashino are a sentient race. In Naya, the humans ride alligator-like mounts. This card depicts an ironic scene: A Jund viashino is surrounding by Naya alligator-beasts . . . which is sort of analogous to a modern-day human being hunted down by cavemen.  
>  Focus: the scene  
>  Mood: Dinner with the ancestors. You're the entree.* 
> 
> 
> 

The next step is for the artist to submit sketches of his or her vision of the art description.

### Sketches

Here's Raymond's initial sketch submitted for Predatory Advantage:

It's just a sketch, but the air of menace is unmistakable.

### Final Art

Raymond submitted this final art.

### Finished Card

And here's the card in its final state, as you can find in booster packs of *Alara Reborn*!
