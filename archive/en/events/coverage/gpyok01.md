Grand Prix Yokohama Coverage
----------------------------


Team AlphaBetaUnlimited.com came out on top over 282 teams from four different countries to win Grand Prix Yokohama! This isn't exactly the same ABU that won the Masters in Tokyo (Noah Boeken's spot is being filled by David Williams), but it's still clear that this team is unstoppable in Japan.
