**What's the toughest first-pick decision you've had in *Born of the Gods* / *Theros* draft?** 



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpnag14/yasooka.jpg)***Shouta Yasooka**: For me, there are no difficult picks.* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpnag14/yamamoto.jpg)***Kentarou Yamamoto**: [Raised by Wolves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raised+by+Wolves) vs. [Bolt of Keranos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bolt+of+Keranos). I hate green, but I couldn't say no to the enchantment.* 



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpnag14/kuo.jpg)***Tzu Ching Kuo**: [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) vs. [Retraction Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retraction+Helix).* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpnag14/yukuhiro.jpg)***Ken Yukuhiro**:[Fall of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fall+of+the+Hammer) vs. [Asphyxiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asphyxiate). I used to think it was [Fall of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fall+of+the+Hammer), but now I think [Asphyxiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asphyxiate) is right.* 



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpnag14/lee.jpg)***Shi-Tian Lee**: [Retraction Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retraction+Helix) vs. [Glimpse the Sun God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Sun+God).* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpnag14/mori.jpg)***Katsuhiro Mori**: (6-0 in draft at the Pro Tour, 3-0 his first draft here) It's all easy!*
