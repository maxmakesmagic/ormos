***Jake Hart:** Play. It's a fast format and this allows the ability to convoke first.*

***Huang Hao-Shan:** Draw, provided you have enough removal.*

***Chapman Sim:** Usually draw, unless your deck is aggressive enough.*

***Soh Weng Heng:** Play if your cards are fast, draw is you have 6 to 8 removal spells.*

***Kelvin Chew:** Draw. It allows me to get my lands to play my bombs.*
