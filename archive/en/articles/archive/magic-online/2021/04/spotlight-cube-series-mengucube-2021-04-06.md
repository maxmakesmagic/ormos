 Andrea Mengucci è un giovane giocatore marchigiano, che vanta tra i suoi risultati una Top8 al Pro Tour Journey into Nyx e la medaglia di Capitano Italiano per il 2014 oltre alle dieci partecipazioni a Pro Tour. 






It brings me great joy to show you the cube that I and my friends from Senigallia, Italy, my hometown, have worked on and improved for almost three years.


My community is mostly Legacy and Vintage players, so it was natural for us to start with *[Magic Online](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist)*['s](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist) *[Vintage Cube](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist)*, and from there, we modified it with our personal preferences, set after set.


The first thing we noticed was that the packs were always running out of blue cards, and we would always find ourselves with several white, red, and green cards that none of us really wanted by the end of each pack.


Our play group was more attracted to blue control, artifact strategies, or combo decks. As a result, cards like [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), [Baneslayer Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel), and [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) were just underappreciated. Often, you were forced to draft certain archetypes when you didn't want to, even though Cube Draft is supposed to be an escape from normal Draft and a place where one could draft some of the most busted cards in *Magic*.


As a result, the *MenguCube* isn't perfectly color balanced. We have 87 blue cards, 84 artifacts, 72 lands, 66 green cards, 60 red cards, 57 black cards, 57 white cards, and even the multicolor cards skew toward blue. As you can see, the cube includes more of the colors and archetypes that we enjoy most: blue cards and artifacts.


In the *MenguCube*, you don't need to aggressively cut blue in the first picks, like I tend to do whenever I draft MTGO's *Vintage Cube*. You can focus on some precious dual lands or artifacts first.


ARCHETYPES
==========


ARTIFACTS
---------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Izzet+Signet)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Signet)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Talisman+of+Creativity)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Creativity)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mishra%27s+Workshop)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop)
Artifacts is the archetype that I love the most, and it's very hard to come together in the normal *Vintage Cube* on MTGO. There are only ten Signets, and every player is looking for them. In *MenguCube*, not only do you have twelve options between Signets and Talismans, but you also have access to [Coldsteel Heart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coldsteel+Heart), [Prismatic Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens), [Chromatic Lantern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Lantern), and [Hedron Archive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Archive).


You will find every single blue Talisman and Signet, once again prioritizing blue mana fixing since your deck is most likely to be blue and you'll want that extra fixing from mana rocks.


The best payoff for ramping up with mana rocks is [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), but I also love to cast [Wildfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) and [Burning of Xinye](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+of+Xinye). [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) and [Emry, Lurker of the Loch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emry%2C+Lurker+of+the+Loch) are two very powerful cards that only get exploited in this archetype, two of which you definitely have to pick high if you want to draft this archetype.


A special card in my heart is [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer), which is castable in this cube thanks to the Talismans and the pain lands such as [Shivan Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef).


*MenguCube* also has plenty of answers for this super-good and fun archetype, with red having access to [Embereth Shieldbreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embereth+Shieldbreaker), [Irreverent Revelers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irreverent+Revelers), [Manic Vandal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal), [Opportunistic Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opportunistic+Dragon), and [Release the Gremlins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Release+the+Gremlins). Green has [Manglehorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manglehorn), [Reclamation Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclamation+Sage), [Gemrazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemrazer), [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime), [Sawtusk Demolisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sawtusk+Demolisher), and [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim). These work to hose this archetype.


AGGRO DECKS
-----------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fiery+Confluence)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Confluence)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Armageddon)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon)
Even though we cut down the number of red and white cards, that doesn't mean this is only a combo or control cube. Boros aggro and mono-red are the most winning archetypes in our cube. If you want to draft aggro, you'll find a higher density of good cards in those colors with less competition, since most people just want to draft the fancy cool stuff rather than beating down with a [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide).


Since there's a lower number of cards of some colors going around, you have to be aware of that. Picking up some dual lands can really help a Boros or Gruul deck to be ready for a splash. Or, you can go fully Boros. White and red are the two best aggro decks, with red being great at killing fast and white shutting the door with [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) and [Ravages of War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravages+of+War).


As I mentioned, keep an eye on anti-artifact creatures. Those are very important and definitely main-deckable considering the huge number of artifacts going around in the packs.


White-Blue X BLINK
------------------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soulherder)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulherder)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ephemerate)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephemerate)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Flametongue+Kavu)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu)
An archetype that we recently added and loved is white-blue X blink. [Soulherder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulherder) is a special card and fun to pair with "enters the battlefield" creatures such as [Flametongue Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu) or [Avalanche](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche) Rider.


[Ephemerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephemerate) is another important piece of the ETB blink deck and is especially nice to pair with evoke creatures such as [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) or [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw). You can cast these creatures for their evoke cost and blink them before they get sacrificed to get double (or even triple!) triggers and then keep the creature around.


INFINITE TURNS COMBO
--------------------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Time+Vault)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ral+Zarek)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ral+Zarek)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kiora%27s+Follower)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%27s+Follower)
[Time Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault) is a card that appeared in one iteration of *Vintage Cube* and was further removed for being "unfun." We generally agreed with that and removed most of the regular combo pieces you'd see along with it, such as [Manifold Key](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manifold+Key) and [Tezzeret the Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret+the+Seeker).


However, we decided to keep the [Time Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault) combo around. It can only go off with a few specific cards such as [Ral Zarek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ral+Zarek) and [Kiora's Follower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%27s+Follower); you can still create an infinite-turn loop, but it'll involve cards that are much easier to remove.


Alternatively, you can also pair the [Time Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault) with [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), or [Zealous Conscripts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zealous+Conscripts) to grant yourself an additional turn by untapping the Vault. If you pair them with a [Soulherder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulherder), you can even get an infinite loop!


RAMP
----


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gaea%27s+Cradle)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Cradle)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Natural+Order)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Opposition)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition)
Ramp is one of the easier archetypes to draft in *Vintage Cube*, and it's well supported in *MenguCube*. Green *is* the second most popular color. When drafting ramp, focus on getting four or five cheap mana creatures, some powerful payoffs, and some key interactions.


The deck is often in Simic colors since you're splashing for some powerful blue cards that you will likely pick up along the way. It's very important to have a [Tropical Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tropical+Island) or a [Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool) because most of the strong blue cards are double-blue and this deck must have at least ten green sources to always kick things off with a [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) of some sort.


Once again, it's very important that you prioritize artifact removal. There's plenty of those to choose from, and I tend to main deck all that I draft.


REANIMATOR AND OTHER COMBO DECKS
--------------------------------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=entomb)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sneak+Attack)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Palinchron)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palinchron)
Just like in *Vintage Cube*, reanimator, storm, and [Eureka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eureka)/[Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) decks are available. For those who haven't played them, let me explain them.


Swamp, [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual), [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb), [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) is your four-card combo to get a [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) into play as early as turn one. Reanimator isn't just an all-in combo, though. One of my favorite ways to draft a reanimator deck is to pair it with efficient interactive cards, making a blue-black control deck that can hard-cast threats like [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) and [Massacre Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Massacre+Wurm) if it needs to.


My favorite reanimation target is [Terastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terastodon) since it dodges removal by having a strong enters-the-battlefield trigger. You can often blow up key pieces of the opponent's board to unlock your game or apply lots of pressure by blowing up your own lands and attacking with Elephants.


I tend to take [Terastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terastodon) very high, since it also works in [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack), [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach), and [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order) decks. It's really the perfect card whenever you want to do unfair stuff. If you can't find [Terastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terastodon), *MenguCube* also has [Worldspine Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldspine+Wurm), which is great with any of those cards, too.


Storm is obviously a very supported archetype, with several ways to get infinite mana going with [Palinchron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palinchron), [High Tide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide), [Mana Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Flare), or [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring). After playing storm decks over and over, we ended up cutting [Past in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames), [Yawgmoth's Bargain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Bargain), and [Thousand-Year Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thousand-Year+Storm). Despite the fact that these cards are usually associated with storm decks, they just aren't that good. If you want to win with the storm archetype, you should focus on efficient interactions, card advantage, and a win condition. The best option is to deck your opponent with [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze), but you can also just kill them with [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) or [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony).


BLUE CONTROL
------------


Last, but certainly not least, is blue control. With 87 blue cards and many more among the multicolor cards, you'll often find yourself in a blue deck that, of course, can take many different routes: I've already talked about green-blue ramp, white-blue aggro, blue-black reanimator, and blue-red splinter twin. Basically, blue is like parsley: wherever you put it, it'll be a nice addition.


Starting a draft by picking [Glen Elendra Archmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glen+Elendra+Archmage) and [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) can never lead to a disaster. You can, of course, draft white-blue or blue-black control, but it'll have a harder time than in regular *Vintage Cube*. There are fewer mediocre Naya creatures, and you'll find yourself winning games less often just by casting a [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God).


Nonetheless, blue control is an excellent archetype. Counterspells plus removal spells plus very good win conditions ([Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx), [Bribery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery), etc.) is a great way to win in *MenguCube*.


I hope I covered most of the differences between *MenguCube* and its ancestor, the normal *Vintage Cube*. I'm proud to assert that we've made a great alternative version of it.
