Have you ever wanted to waltz right into Wizards of the Coast's office and school them in games of *Magic*? You might not get that chance any time soon, but in the meantime, you can watch some of the *Magic*'s beloved streamers, podcasters, and other content-makers fight on behalf of the entire community! Follow Walking the Planes and go inside Wizards for the annual Community Cup. Equal parts casual and epic, it all adds up to one of the most fun events of the year.
