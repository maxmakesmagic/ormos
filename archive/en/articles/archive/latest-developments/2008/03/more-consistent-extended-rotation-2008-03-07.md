Welcome back. Today I'm going to talk about our [recent change](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=dci/announce/dci20080229a) to Extended rotation. If tournaments aren't your bag, feel free to skip this one and check back later.


**Quick Quiz** Under the old Extended rotation system, how many years of **Magic** sets would be legal in October 2009, when the set codenamed "Live" becomes legal for play? Is the answer a little hard to name off the top of your head? Is the answer "I'd have to look it up"? That's because the old Extended rotation system is not very easy to remember. That's one of the reasons our recent announcement streamlined the Extended rotation system to a new, simpler, twelve-word definition:


*"Extended is the last seven years of **Magic** blocks and core sets."* 


Implemented six years ago in May 2002, the old Extended rotation system was to rotate out three **Magic** blocks every three years. That system is easy to describe in the abstract, but makes it hard to figure out what's legal at any particular time, or what will be legal a couple of years down the road.


Under the old rotation policy, to figure out the answer, it feels like you would need the internet, a number two pencil, a protractor, and an SAT prep book.


Under the new rotation policy, to figure out the answer, just say "seven years." Because now every block is legal in Extended for exactly seven years.


So how has the Extended rotation actually changed? One big difference is that under the old system, Extended was sometimes six years of blocks, sometimes seven years of blocks, and sometimes eight years of blocks. By contrast, in the new rotation system, Extended is always seven years of blocks.


Likewise, under the old system, some blocks were legal in Extended for six years, some were legal for seven years, and some were legal for eight years. In the new rotation system, every block is legal for exactly seven years.


The best way to show the difference is visually:




| OLD ROTATION SYSTEM |
| Oct 2008 | Oct 2009 | Oct 2010 | Oct 2011 |
| 6 Blocks | 7 Blocks | 8 Blocks | 6 Blocks |
|  |  |  |  |
| *Mirrodin* | *Mirrodin* | *Mirrodin* |  |
| *Kamigawa* | *Kamigawa* | *Kamigawa* |  |
| *Ravnica* | *Ravnica* | *Ravnica* |  |
| *Time Spiral* | *Time Spiral* | *Time Spiral* | *Time Spiral* |
| *Lorwyn / Shadowmoor* | *Lorwyn / Shadowmoor* | *Lorwyn / Shadowmoor* | *Lorwyn / Shadowmoor* |
| "Rock" | "Rock" | "Rock" | "Rock" |
|  | "Live" | "Live" | "Live" |
|  |  | "Lights" | "Lights" |
|  |  |  | "Shake" |



| NEW ROTATION SYSTEM |
| Oct 2008 | Oct 2009 | Oct 2010 | Oct 2011 |
| 7 Blocks | 7 Blocks | 7 Blocks | 7 Blocks |
|  |  |  |  |
| *Onslaught* |  |  |  |
| *Mirrodin* | *Mirrodin* |  |  |
| *Kamigawa* | *Kamigawa* | *Kamigawa* |  |
| *Ravnica* | *Ravnica* | *Ravnica* | *Ravnica* |
| *Time Spiral* | *Time Spiral* | *Time Spiral* | *Time Spiral* |
| *Lorwyn / Shadowmoor* | *Lorwyn / Shadowmoor* | *Lorwyn / Shadowmoor* | *Lorwyn / Shadowmoor* |
| "Rock" | "Rock" | "Rock" | "Rock" |
|  | "Live" | "Live" | "Live" |
|  |  | "Lights" | "Lights" |
|  |  |  | "Shake" |

You might notice that this table contains a few codenames for future sets. In 2005, Mark Rosewater ran a poll to determine upcoming codenames. When he [announced the results](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/epic-struggles-2005-05-09), he revealed that the block beginning in fall of this year is codenamed "Rock" / "Paper" / "Scissors," and the block after that is codenamed "Live" / "Long" / "Prosper." Now, it's my pleasure to announce for the first time that the block beginning in fall of 2010 is codenamed "Lights" / "Camera" / "Action," and the block beginning in fall of 2011 is codenamed "Shake" / "Rattle" / "Roll." Both of these are triplets that also appear in Mark's poll.


### Extended Rotation Details


*"Extended is the last seven years of **Magic** blocks and core sets."* 


[![Crop_Rotation](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/UZ/Crop_Rotation.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crop%2BRotation)Each year, when a new large set is released in the fall and becomes legal in Extended, the oldest year of blocks in Extended rotates out.


*Coldsnap* rotates out of Extended when *Time Spiral* block does, in 2013, seven years after *Time Spiral* entered Extended. (*Coldsnap*‘s rotation is attached to *Time Spiral* block, just like it is in Standard.)


The *Lorwyn* / *Morningtide* block and *Shadowmoor* / *Eventide* block count as "one year of blocks." All four sets rotate out of Extended together, in 2014, seven years after *Lorwyn* entered Extended.


### Examples of Extended Rotation


When "Rock" becomes legal for tournament play this October, *Odyssey* / *Torment* / *Judgment* block and *Seventh Edition* rotate out of Extended. At that time, the seven years of blocks legal in Extended will be *Onslaught*, *Mirrodin*, *Kamigawa*, *Ravnica*, *Time Spiral*, *Lorwyn* / *Shadowmoor*, and "Rock" block. *Coldsnap* will be legal because it sticks with *Time Spiral* block. All core sets from *Eighth Edition* forward will be legal.


When "Live" becomes legal for tournament play in October 2009, *Onslaught* / *Legions* / *Scourge* block rotates out of Extended. At that time, the seven years of blocks legal in Extended will be *Mirrodin*, *Kamigawa*, *Ravnica*, *Time Spiral*, *Lorwyn* / *Shadowmoor*, "Rock" block, and "Live" block. *Coldsnap* will be legal because it is sticks with *Time Spiral* block. All core sets from *Eighth Edition* forward will be legal.


The last seven years of core sets are legal as well. When "Rock" enters Extended this October, the core sets of the previous seven years will be in Extended too: *Eighth Edition*, *Ninth Edition*, and *Tenth Edition*. When a core set is released in the summer of 2009, nothing rotates out of Extended and *Eighth Edition* remains legal, since *Eighth Edition* will have been released within the last seven years. When "Live" enters Extended in October 2009 and *Onslaught* block rotates out, Eighth Edition still stays legal, since it will have been released within the last seven years.


There are three big reasons for the change:


**1) Each block should be legal in Extended for the same amount of time.**


Under the old system, it was unfair and bizarre that some blocks were legal in Extended for eight years total, some were legal for seven years total, and some were legal for six years total. For example, in the old system, *Invasion* would be legal in Extended for eight years, *Odyssey* would be legal in Extended seven years, and *Onslaught* would be legal in Extended only six years.


Why should *Onslaught* be doomed to rotate out so quickly? Why should *Onslaught* cards have such a shorter lifespan in Extended than *Invasion* cards? Those very different lifespans were completely arbitrary. If *Mercadian Masques* had been released in 2000 instead of 1999, it would have been legal in Extended for eight years total instead of six years. It was completely random, based only on the digits in a set's release date.


The new rotation policy is more consistent and more fair to each block. The new system keeps each block legal in Extended for exactly seven years, just like every other block.


**2) Historically, eight-year Extended formats have been a little too big, and six-year Extended formats have been a little too small. We believe seven-year Extended formats have had the best gameplay, power, speed, balance between deck types, and level of interaction.**


Once we decided to make each block legal in Extended for the same amount of time, the question became "How long should each block be legal?" Extended has been steadily growing in popularity over the last six years, ever since it diverged from its Stone Age roots in the Legacy-style "Type 1.X" format many years ago.


[![Incremental_Growth](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/LRW/Incremental_Growth.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Incremental%2BGrowth)During the last six years, Extended has oscillated between six years of cards and eight years of cards, and players have reported that that size feels about right. It's important to us and to players that Extended be very different from Standard, and very different from Legacy and Vintage. Extended has truly achieved its own personality.


The average lifespan of a block in Extended so far has been seven years, and we feel that's right on. To maintain the level of gameplay, power, speed, balance between deck types and level of interaction of Extended over the last several years, we believe that we should stick to that average seven-year lifespan that has worked well for the format so far. The best way to keep the overall feel of Extended the same is to keep the average lifespan of a block in Extended the same: seven years.


In addition, when Extended has been eight years large (once every three years), it has sometimes threatened to be too fast, with games decided too quickly and with too little gameplay interaction. Combo decks are always powerful in Extended, but they can get especially insane during those eight-years-large Extended formats. For example, the current Extended format is eight years large, and Dredge can consistently win on turn two or three, held in check only by zero-mana answers like [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) and [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void).


In general, combo is a natural, healthy part of Extended, but eight-years-large Extended formats can allow combo decks to get too far out of hand. The more years of cards are available in a format, the stronger combo decks tend to be.


**Magic** Developer and Top 8 veteran of (Extended) Pro Tour–Rome 1998 Erik Lauer elaborates:


**3) The new Extended rotation policy is easier to remember.**


[![Ancestral_Memories](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/MI/Ancestral_Memories.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ancestral%2BMemories)You've probably memorized it already:


*"Extended is the last seven years of **Magic** blocks and core sets."*


No more asking...


*"When does Extended rotate?"* 


or...


*"What rotates out of Extended this time?"* 


or...


*"Hey, what's legal in Extended these days?"*


Because now the answers are always consistent and predictable. To me, the result is an Extended format that is fundamentally the same as it ever was, just more stable and more fair to each block.


### No Bans for Now


We have been keeping a close eye on Extended recently, watching its best decks, how fast they are, and how effective the tools are to disrupt them. Overall, Extended players have been happy, and we've been happy. The format keeps evolving week by week, with new "best decks" arising each week, then falling back into the crowd as other players find ways around them. That's always a good sign of a healthy format. There are no bans in Extended this time.


October 31st marks the post-rotation, "Rock"-legal Extended Pro Tour–Berlin. I'm looking forward to seeing the face of the new format.


### Looking to the Future


The details of the next block's Extended rotation will always be available and updated on the [format page](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=judge/resources/banned) and in the  [**Magic** floor rules](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home).


We haven't changed the Extended rotation policy since May 2002. I won't say we'll never change it again, but I would expect this rotation policy to last at least that long, which takes us up through 2014 and beyond. If anyone has early predictions about which Extended decks will be good in 2014, send them my way!


As for myself, I have an early prediction of a card I'm pretty sure will be highly playable in Extended of 2014. Click here to see it and decide if you agree:

### Last Week


One thing I wanted to add to [last week's article](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/be-careful-stealing-2008-02-29) about [Control Magic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic)s is that I feel [Persuasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion) is a good, simple card at the right power level. I'd be happy to see [Persuasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion) in future core sets. I also like printing [Persuasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion) at *Tenth Edition*‘s uncommon level, not *Odyssey*‘s rare. I feel ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) is the correct cost for this effect and I'm happy to print it there. I just don't want to super-push its power level needlessly high by going to ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)[Control Magic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic) or [Treachery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery). As in many development scenarios, it's amazing how much difference one mana can make.


### Last Week's Poll




| **Have you ever played in a group with house rules that ban cards for being too annoying?** |
| Yes | 4101 | 53.1% |
| No | 3625 | 46.9% |
| **Total** | **7726** | **100.0%** |

This is one of the closest poll results we've had yet. Some multiplayer groups decided to ban multiplayer-superkicked cards like [Weird Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weird+Harvest) or [New Frontiers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=New+Frontiers). On the other side of the spectrum, one group banned "[Disenchant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant)" because it kept disrupting their intricate combos! Most people in casual groups who said they have never banned a card instead rely on "frown technology," where people keep frowning at the guy with the [Words of Wind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Words+of+Wind) combo deck that keeps making everyone put all their permanents in their hands until that guy gets the message and puts his [Words of Wind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Words+of+Wind)deck back into his deckbox.
