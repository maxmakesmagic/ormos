![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a907.jpg)Both Regis Lavoisier and Fabien Francois are good French players. Both are relatively unknown outside of their country as they don't often travel much. Today they are still in contention for top 8 with 10-2 records. Francois is running another deck popular with the French today, blue-green madness, while Lavoisier is running the crazy red-blue [Draco](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco) explosion deck the Japanese debuted at PT Houston.

Francois started with a [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) on turn 1 then shuffled away the card he didn't want with a [Flooded Strand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand). He followed with a surprise visitor to the Extended arena â€“ [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba).

Francois was stuck with two islands and could only make another [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba).

Lavoisier wasn't faring much better as he dropped a [Scroll Rack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Rack) in an attempt to find a third land. He activated it and switched all eight cards from his hand.

Both [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba)'s came in next turn. With R1 mana open Francois chose to only switch the power of one. Sure enough Lavoisier had [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)/[Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice) and dispatched one. The second met the same fate the following turn.

Francois had [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) in graveyard, but concerned about what Lavoisier might do he kept mana open to sit on countermagic. Lavoisier had to go for more land, he tapped an island for [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) but only found a forest leaving Lavoisier a window of opportunity. Lavoisier [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ed for an island at end of turn. He untapped and switched two cards from his hand with the rack. He then pointed an [Erratic Explosion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion) at Francois's head. Not quite as Erratic when you know the top card is [Draco](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco).

While this didn't kill Francois it left him at a precarious 1 life. He countered the [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) but had no answer for Lavoisier's [Fairie Conclave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fairie+Conclave).

Lavoisier 1-0 Francois

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a908.jpg)Francois found an early forest this time and started with the UG classic of turn two [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) followed by turn 3 [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm).

Lavoisier switched 6 cards with a [Scroll Rack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Rack). He made a [Polluted Delta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) then passed turn. Francois asked if he could attack and Lavoisier got rid of the useless cards on top of his library with the Delta and Racked for the answer.

[Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)/[Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice) looked a strong possibility, but it didn't prevent him from dying as Francois had a [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic) in hand.

Lavoisier 1-1 Francois

Game 3 Francois pulled off a [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)/sac land trick of his own. He went for [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) only for Lavoisier to [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) it.

Both players proceeded to build up their hands, Francois with [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), Lavoisier with an amazing 3 [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge). A [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) from Francois met with a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), but he could still make a [Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a909.jpg)The turn after Francois went to add an elephant token to the mix with [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd). This sparked an interesting exchange as Lavoisier went for his 4th [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) in response. Francois attempted to [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic) it, this was countered and then Lavoisier dealt with the elephant token with a [Chain of Vapor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor). A [Scroll Rack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Rack) looked good for Lavoisier with all the cards he'd drawn.

Francois wasn't getting any quick offence, just another [Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla) as he flashed back [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). He deliberately left himself 3 mana open for [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic).

Lavoisier upset that plan by tapping an island end of turn with [Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice). Francois [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize)d the [Scroll Rack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Rack) in the hope that would help but Lavoisier had already set his library up.

Boom. [Erratic Explosion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion) flipped over [Draco](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco) and that was game and match to Lavoisier.

**Final Result:** Regis Lavoisier beat Fabien Francois 2-1
