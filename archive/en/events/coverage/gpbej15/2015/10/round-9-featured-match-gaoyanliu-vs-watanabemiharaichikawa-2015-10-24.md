As mentioned in a previous [Feature Article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbej15/awesomeness-scale-1-10-2015-10-24), three of the region's titans are in danger of elimination. Sitting at the 6-2 record, Yuuya Watanabe, Makihito Mihara and Yuuki Ichikawa will need to best Gao Zhenxing, Yan Tianji and Liu Xu if they wished to advance.


The Japanese players have assembled a Blue-Black Ingest deck, a Black-Green Eldrazi Ramp deck with a Red Splash, as well as the ubiquitous Red-Green Landfall deck. This seemed like the "standard industry practice" and all three decks looked pretty solid.


The Chinese were equipped a Black-Green Eldrazi Ramp deck too, but the other two decks were quite different. Their Blue-Black Ingest deck wasn't quite at the power level they desired and preferred to go with White-Blue Fliers instead.


In addition, they've axed the Red-Green Landfall strategy to make way for a 5-Color Green deck to fully utilize all the remaining rares cards in their pool, including [Shambling Vent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Vent), [Cinder Glade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cinder+Glade), [Angelic Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Captain), [Exert Influence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exert+Influence), [Akoum Firebird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akoum+Firebird), [Prism Array](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prism+Array) and [Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames)!


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Prism+Array)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prism+Array)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Radiant+Flames)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames)
Let's see if this decision will pay off for them!


Table A: Gao Zhenxing (5-Color Green) vs. Yuuya Watanabe (Blue-Black Ingest)
============================================================================


 


Watanabe countered [Valakut Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut+Invoker) with [Horribly Awry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horribly+Awry), before cycling [Grave Birthing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Birthing) to ramp out [Windrider Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windrider+Patrol). Gao toasted it with [Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames), but Watanabe reloaded with [Kozilek's Channeler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Channeler) and [Ruin Processor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+Processor), two threats that proved too difficult to handle.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kozilek%27s+Channeler)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Channeler)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ruin+Processor)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+Processor)
Game 2 was pretty similar, with Watanabe using his first few turns to deflect Gao's threats using [Complete Disregard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Complete+Disregard) and [Spell Shrivel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Shrivel). When [Kozilek's Channeler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Channeler) landed, that provided a premature [Ruin Processor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+Processor) once again. Still holding on to [Ulamog's Nullifier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%27s+Nullifier), Watanabe quickly secured the first victory for his team.


Now, only either of his teammates needed to win to advance to Day 2.

*Completing his match quickly, Watanabe quickly slides over to help out Ichikawa who is in trouble. A worried Mihara watches as he sideboards for his match.*


**Gao Zhenxing 0—Yuuya Watanabe 2**


Table B: Yan Tianji (White-Blue Fliers) vs. Makihito Mihara (Black-Red-Green Eldrazi Ramp)
==========================================================================================


Mihara recruited [Lifespring Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifespring+Druid) to gain access to all his three colors, before attempting to resolve [Barrage Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrage+Tyrant). It met with [Spell Shrivel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Shrivel), and Liu used [Murk Strider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murk+Strider) to bounce home [Lifespring Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifespring+Druid).


However, Mihara turned up the heat with [From Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=From+Beyond) and quickly took over the game by assembling the ridiculously-unfair engine of [Smothering Abomination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smothering+Abomination), [Vampiric Rites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Rites) and [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat)!

"Jeez, he's got everything," Yan laughed it off and reached for his sideboard.


Once again in Game 2, [Lifespring Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifespring+Druid) enabled a turn-four [Barrage Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrage+Tyrant), but it was sent to the top of Mihara's deck via [Roil Spout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roil+Spout). Despite "topdecking" it again, Mihara elected to summon [Brood Monitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brood+Monitor).


That enabled a 5/5 [Vile Aggregate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Aggregate) to hit the board next turn, and Yan's clock of [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner) and [Cloud Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Manta) was no match against Mihara's board. [Bone Splinters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Splinters) ensured that Yan would never reach the finish line.

*The writing was on the wall for Yan, Liu and Gao. The Japanese had bested them.*


**Yan Tianji 0—Makihito Mihara 2**


Table C: Liu Xu (Blue-Black Ingest) vs. Yuuki Ichikawa (Red-Green Landfall)
===========================================================================


Ichikawa's Red-Green Landfall deck ran as smoothly as a well-oiled machine. Kicking off with [Snapping Gnarlid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Gnarlid), [Grove Rumbler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+Rumbler) and [Territorial Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Territorial+Baloth), a timely [Stonefury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonefury) denied Liu of any fatties that could trade.


Just like that, Liu was down a game.


In the second game, Liu quickly snuck in for a couple of hits with [Sludge Crawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sludge+Crawler) before using [Call the Scions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+the+Scions) to accelerate into [Brood Monitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brood+Monitor). Ichikawa had a slow start, but had [Boiling Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boiling+Earth) to wipe out the horde of Eldrazi Scions, before assembling the formidable offense of double [Grove Rumbler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+Rumbler).


However, they were forced to chump when Liu recovered with a second copy of [Call the Scions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+the+Scions) and [Spawning Bed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawning+Bed). The follow-up was a pair of [Swarm Surge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+Surge)s and Ichikawa immediately was kept on the back-foot. Down to just two life facing five Eldrazi Scions, he was forced to keep his team of [Snapping Gnarlid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Gnarlid), [Valakut Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut+Predator) and a pair of [Valakut Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut+Invoker)s back home to play it safe.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Valakut+Invoker)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut+Invoker)
But whoops, Liu had topdecked [Plated Crusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Crusher) and was able to trample past Ichikawa's defenses for the final two damage.


Thankfully for Ichikawa, playing out Game 3 wasn't necessary, because his trusty teammates have already secured the match and their spot in Day 2.


**Liu 1—Yuuki Ichikawa 1**


**Watanabe/Mihara/Ichikawa defeats Gao/Yan/Liu to progress to Day 2, and lived to see another day!**
