Look, it's our 25th Anniversary *and* the return of the core set. You could excuse us for getting a little excited. So excited, in fact, that we're moving the release date of *Core Set 2019* up a week to July 13, 2018. It was previously announced as July 20, 2018.


That moves up many of the previously announced dates for *Core Set 2019* as well. The new dates are as follows:


**Open House**: June 30–July 1, 2018  
**Prerelease Weekend**: July 7–8, 2018  
**Draft Weekend**: July 14–15, 2018  
***Magic Online* Launch**: July 16, 2018  
**On Sale in *Magic Online***: July 20, 2018


The dates for the *Core Set 2019* Store Championship (September 15–16) and the 25th Anniversary Pro Tour (August 3–5) remain unchanged.
