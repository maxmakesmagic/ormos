What's your favorite card, and why?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** There are lots of cards I like. I love [Sliver Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen) because it's the first card whose art ever made me feel *tiny*. I love [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) because it has probably my favorite line of text on a **Magic** card ever. And I love [Reaper King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+King) for its unapologetic five-color, "twuberg," artifact-gold frame, "harvest time" wackiness.

But if you're talking about specific cards, I'd have to say it's the *Revised Edition* [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon) I opened the first time I ever bought **Magic** cards. I bought a 60-card starter and two boosters, but I don't remember which order I opened them or which one [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon) was in. Anyway, it's one of the first 90 cards I ever owned, and although it may not be all that rare or sought-after, it's very dear to me.

Are there stronger cards? Sure. Cards with better art? Definitely. But that particular copy of [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon) marks the moment when I fell totally in love with **Magic**. In fact, that very card now hangs on my cube wall, to remind me why I work on this web site every day:

I'm here for the dragons.
