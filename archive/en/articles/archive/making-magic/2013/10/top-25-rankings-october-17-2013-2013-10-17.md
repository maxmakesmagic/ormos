There's a new name on top of the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings, and it completes a memorable weekend for new Hall of Famer Ben Stark. His Top 64 finish at [Pro Tour *Theros*](/en/events/coverage/ptthr13) was enough to take him just ahead of reigning Player of the Year Josh Utter-Leyton. With [World Champion](/en/events/coverage/woc13) Shahar Shenhar remaining in 3rd place, the top of the table is dominated by team [ChannelFireball](http://store.channelfireball.com/landing). 

 With one exception, the rest of the Top 10 from last week remained, with Reid Duke overtaking Japan's Yuuya Watanabe for 4th place. The exception was the extraordinary performance of France's Jérémy Dezani. The [Grand Prix Lyon 2012](/en/events/coverage/jund-jolts-jeremy-top) champion came to the Pro Tour as part of Team Revolution, and their mono-blue devotion deck paid off handsomely; Dezani ultimately claimed the title from compatriot and teammate Pierre Dagen. 

 Dezani heads the list of four new players in the rankings this week, and the others all hail from the United States. [Pro Tour Amsterdam 2010](/en/events/coverage/ptamd10) champion Paul Rietzl enters at no. 17, thanks to his Top 8 finish in Dublin. [Pro Tour Nagoya](/en/events/coverage/ptnag11) champion David Sharfman joins the rankings in 19th place, with a finish at the Pro Tour just outside the Top 8. Then there's [Grand Prix Minneapolis 2012](/en/events/coverage/calcano-triumphant-aberrant-delver-deck) winner Christian Calcano. He brought Esper Control to the Standard rounds and finished in the Pro Tour Top 16. 

 Other big movers were the two semifinalists. Makihito Mihara, the [2006 World Champion](/en/events/coverage/mihara-dutch-crowned-world-champions), pushed past a ton of big names on his way to no. 12 on the list, while Sam Black was the week's biggest mover, starting the week tied for 25th place and finishing it in 13th. It's also noticeable that, on the biggest stage, only three of the top 25 failed to make Day Two of the Pro Tour. 

 Join us again next week for the latest update in the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings.
