The 'Crux of Modern
===================

Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 







Hello and welcome to Pro Tour *Dark Ascension* Week here on **DailyMTG.com**. The Pro Tour is the highest level of **Magic** competition. Pro Tour competitors are competing for a prize pool of more than $230,000. Money is nice, but qualifying for the Pro Tour is an incredible opportunity for a number of reasons. Thanks to it, I've been to Japan, Malaysia, Spain, Germany, England, and countless other places my friends could only dream of visiting. My time on the Pro Tour was valuable to my personal growth and it gave me a much broader worldview.


I'm getting ahead of myself, though. You have to qualify before you can go to the Pro Tour and experience these incredible events. There are a few different ways to qualify, but Pro Tour Qualifier events are the most accessible by far. Pro Tour Qualifiers are held regularly all over the world. Winners of these events receive free travel to the upcoming Pro Tour and an invitation to play.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab181_islands.jpg)Pro Tour *Dark Ascension* is being held in Honolulu, Hawaii. Live coverage of the event will be on **DailyMTG.com** all weekend. Make sure you tune in and watch the best players in the world duke it out to see who will be the Pro Tour *Dark Ascension* champion.


The format of Pro Tour Qualifiers changes from season to season. The current PTQ season is Modern, the newest constructed format. Modern can be a difficult format to build a deck for. There are a lot of cards, like the *Ravnica* shocklands, that can be very difficult to acquire. Many newer players have shied away from Modern PTQs because they're not willing to invest a huge amount to build a competitive deck.


This week, I'd like to offer up a new Modern strategy with the ability to compete against tier-one decks. A few years ago, Adrian Sullivan showed me a Standard brew he was thinking about playing at Nationals. The deck, called Ivan Drago, featured [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux), an overlooked rare from *Eventide*.



![Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Primalcrux)

 

[Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) has always been a beating in the right deck, but newer cards like [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) and [Strangleroot Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangleroot+Geist) give the deck the added boost it needed to compete with some of the more threatening decks in the format. [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) demands you play an overwhelmingly green deck. In the past, this meant you couldn't play removal spells and your two-drop slot was lacking; this made the decks very weak against early removal spells on mana creatures and defenseless against fliers like [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique). [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) and [Strangleroot Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangleroot+Geist) solve the major issues I felt plagued the deck when I tried it in old Extended formats.

I want to build a deck that makes [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) essentially a one-hit kill. I want all my permanents to have all green mana symbols on them. A lot of people might complain that [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) doesn't have enough evasion—there's no shroud or hexproof and something so simple as a [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) is enough to stop it. It's unlikely opponents will still have [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) in their hands when the [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) comes down, though. [Strangleroot Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangleroot+Geist), [Boggart Ram-Gang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Ram-Gang), [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher), [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity), and [Oversoul of Dusk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversoul+of+Dusk) are all going to hit the table before your [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux). It takes a very special kind of human to not use a [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) on targets like that. Then, conveniently enough, [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) actually ramps you into your [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux), which comes down and starts attacking for 20-something points at a time.


Sometimes we're not going to draw [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux), and in those situations we're going to need some other fatties to fill the void.


[Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher) is a super-powerful creature from *Lorwyn*. It's a 7/7 for six mana with flash, and its come-into-play trigger is probably the best thing you could ask for in the current Modern format. [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) might be the most exciting card in the deck, but [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher) is what made me want to build a green ramp deck in the first place. Cawblade and Faeries are the two most popular decks in Modern right now, and [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher) is a nightmare for both of them.



![Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cloudthresher)

 

I've always had a soft spot in my heart for [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity). In 2008, I built a red-green deck for Pro Tour Hollywood that featured this incredible creature. If you're playing a lot of mana-acceleration creatures, it's not unusual to cast [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity) on the third turn. It's easy to imagine how hard it is to lose when you're ahead and have a Deus destroying your opponent's lands. There are a lot of fun tricks with [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity) that allow you to destroy lands even when your opponent decides to chump it with something like a [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk). Remember, [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity) has trample. I like to attack with [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity) and entice my opponent to chump block it in order to save a land. When my opponent chumps with a single creature I can cast [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) on the creature and still deal the full 6 points, thus killing a land. I highly recommend casting this card if you've never gotten the chance—it's quite the beating.



![Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Deus+of+Calamity)

 

I liked [Oversoul of Dusk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversoul+of+Dusk) in theory, but I was underwhelmed when I played against decks like Affinity. I decided to move the [Oversoul of Dusk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversoul+of+Dusk) to the sideboard and bring it in when my opponents had no way to deal with it.


My deck needs to have a solid mid-range game plan to soak up my opponents' removal and keep them on a reactive strategy.


[Boggart Ram-Gang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Ram-Gang) is excellent here, especially since the hybrid mana symbols count as green symbols for my [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux). A 3/3 hasty for three mana is enough to put most opponents on their heels. They'll be forced to do something crazy, like a [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), which is a grave mistake on their part because you'll use the extra mana to start casting [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher)s and [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux)es a turn earlier. You can replace these with [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) if you're able to acquire them and you're having trouble with RUG Delver decks.



![Boggart Ram-Gang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Boggart+Ram-Gang)

 

[Viridian Corrupter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Corrupter) is another excellent three-drop in the current format. It's hard to find a deck that doesn't include cards like [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating), [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), [Vedalken Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles), or [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). Each of these cards is absolutely crucial to the respective decks' game plans against us. I chose to play [Viridian Corrupter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Corrupter) over [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) because it more effectively baits people into using removal spells. Opponents will be unable to attack or block with their [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) and that's a surprisingly big deal. I also have a few copies of [Vines of Vastwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vines+of+Vastwood) between my main deck and sideboard. It takes some luck, but a well-timed pump spell on an infect creature can steal the game from time to time.

[Strangleroot Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangleroot+Geist) is an exciting addition. I feel like [Strangleroot Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangleroot+Geist) is one of the only two-drops you can play that absolutely demands your opponent to cast [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) in most situations. It's very hard to effectively trade or race [Strangleroot Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangleroot+Geist) and opponents will be given fits by the card's tremendous ability to apply constant pressure.


The deck also needs mana accelerators. Cards like [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) aren't very impressive if you're opponent already had time to establish a board presence and has the mana to use a spell like [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). We need to be casting our threats early and often.


[Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf) are the obvious mana accelerators. [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) is better than [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf), but the card is difficult to acquire. If you're lucky enough to own a few, don't be afraid to make the swap.

[Joraga Treespeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joraga+Treespeaker) lets this deck have some really degenerate draws. Think about it: turn one Treespeaker; turn two level-up Treespeaker and tap it to cast [Strangleroot Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangleroot+Geist), turn three [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity). It's going to be difficult for any deck to keep up with that kind of power.



![Joraga Treespeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Joraga+Treespeaker)

 

Originally, I played all [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s as my lands. This was all well and good, but I quickly realized how often I would have been able to activate a [Mosswort Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mosswort+Bridge). It's nice to have some form of card advantage and [Mosswort Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mosswort+Bridge) can shut people out of games very nicely.


Here's the final decklist once I put it all together. The deck plays fifteen rares in the main, but all of them should be easy to trade for.

I played a few games with this list against the best decks in Modern to see how it fared.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab181_sword.jpg)I lost the roll and kept [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Mosswort Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mosswort+Bridge), [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Strangleroot Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangleroot+Geist), [Viridian Corrupter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Corrupter), [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity), and [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux). My opponent played a [Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast). I drew a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played it, and cast [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). My opponent played a land and cast [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), searching up two more copies of the bird. I drew [Vines of Vastwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vines+of+Vastwood), cast [Strangleroot Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangleroot+Geist), and attacked for 2; my opponent took the damage and I played [Mosswort Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mosswort+Bridge) to hide a [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher). My opponent attacked for 1, then cast [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine). I drew [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf), cast [Viridian Corrupter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Corrupter), destroyed the [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), attacked for 2 with [Strangleroot Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangleroot+Geist), played my [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and cast [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf). My opponent attacked for 1 again, cast [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), and played a [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade). I drew a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played it, cast [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity), and passed the turn with one green mana open. My opponent attacked me for 1 again, cast another [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) and played another [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade).


On my next turn, I drew a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played it, and attacked with my team. My opponent blocked the [Strangleroot Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangleroot+Geist) with [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) and aimed a [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) at my [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity), but I was ready for that. In response, I cast [Vines of Vastwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vines+of+Vastwood) with kicker on the [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity) and my opponent took 11 damage, allowing me to destroy a land. I used my [Mosswort Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mosswort+Bridge) to flash in my [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher) and with it destroyed both of my opponent's Hawks.


My opponent passed the turn after playing a fifth land. I drew a [Mosswort Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mosswort+Bridge), cast it, removed a [Boggart Ram-Gang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Ram-Gang), and went to my combat step. My opponent used a [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to tap my team. I cast [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) during my second main phase. My opponent played a sixth land and passed the turn again. I drew a [Boggart Ram-Gang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Ram-Gang), cast it, used the Bridge to make another, and went to my combat step. My opponent cast a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) and used the flashback on [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to tap my team and draw another card. My opponent untapped, played a seventh land, and attacked for 2. I drew a [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), then went to my combat step and got [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)ed again. My opponent cast a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) on my end of turn step, then conceded after not finding another [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) on the draw. For the record, my [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) was big enough to kill in a single swing.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/1_0Footer.jpg)It's important to stress the importance of [Guttural Response](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guttural+Response) in your sideboard when playing against decks with [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab181_game2.jpg)Melira Pod is one of the breakout decks of this PTQ season. The deck uses [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast) with [Viscera Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer) and [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) or [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) to either gain infinite life or deal infinite damage. Melira's ability prevents your persist creatures from getting a –1/–1 counter when they come back. You can repeatedly sacrifice [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) or [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) and use their comes-into-play triggers.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab181_melira.jpg)I lost the roll and kept [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Mosswort Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mosswort+Bridge), [Joraga Treespeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joraga+Treespeaker), [Viridian Corrupter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Corrupter), [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher), and [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). My opponent fetched up a [Temple Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Garden) and cast [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). I played my [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and cast [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). My opponent fetched up another shockland, going to 14, and tapped out for a [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). I drew a [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), played a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), cast [Viridian Corrupter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Corrupter), and destroyed the [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). My opponent cast [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast) and passed the turn. I drew another [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), played [Mosswort Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mosswort+Bridge), hid a [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux), then cast and leveled-up [Joraga Treespeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joraga+Treespeaker). My opponent cast another [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and a [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots). I drew [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) and cast [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher), destroying both Birds. My opponent cast [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks). I drew a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played it, cast [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) on [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast), and attacked with my [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher). My opponent blocked my [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher) with [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) and gained another few life. I cast [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) after playing a land. I drew [Boggart Ram-Gang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Ram-Gang), cast it, used my [Mosswort Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mosswort+Bridge) to add another [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) to the table and attacked with my team. My [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) had more than 20 power, and no matter how my opponent chump-blocked I was going to win.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/2_0Footer.jpg)This deck is a great way to get involved in the Modern format without having to jump through too many hoops to acquire all of the cards. The deck is a competitive alternative to the mainstream decks you can play in Pro Tour Qualifiers. Make sure to tune in to Pro Tour *Dark Ascension* coverage this weekend when you're not playing in your local PTQ. Who knows? Maybe you'll be competing in the next Pro Tour!


Happy Brewing!
