Anthony's [column](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/limiting-your-bad-format-2002-07-02) today is about the "Backdraft" format, which reminded us of the *Legends* card [Backdraft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Backdraft), which reminded us of the movie *Backdraft*, which reminded us that *Legends* has a ton of cards that share names with movies. Among them: [Field of Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+of+Dreams), [Cocoon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cocoon), [The Abyss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Abyss), [Raging Bull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Bull), and, of course, [Backdraft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Backdraft).


We figured the number of card/movie pairs to be around 30, but Bob Flaminio did much more research than we did -- he has the number at 45 for just *Legends* alone! You can see Bob's complete list of **Magic** movie names [here](http://www.flaminio.com/magic/movies.html).
