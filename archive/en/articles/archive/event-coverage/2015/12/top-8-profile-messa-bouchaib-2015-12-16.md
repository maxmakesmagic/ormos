![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPHEL00/164.jpg)**Name:** Messa Bouchaib  
**Age:** 20  
**Location:** Mariestad, Sweden  
**Occupation:** Driving a Magic store and studying  
**Played Magic since:** 5 years ago, Ice Age  
**Best accomplishments:** Qualified for 1999 Pro Tour Chicago, Won a PTQ for 2000 Pro Tour New York.



**Q: What made you decide to come to Grand Prix Helsinki?**  

A: Viking Line (party boat)



**Q: What were your expectations going into this tournament, and why?**  

A: That would depend on what cards I would get. But when I saw the cards, I thought I would do badly.



**Q: Briefly describe your tournament play-wise so far, both day one and day two.**  

A: First day, I had only one mulligan all day. Second day, got a rather good draft deck, went 2-1, then a really bad U/W deck and managed to win a match to make top 8.



**Q: What do you think about the formats used in this tournament, and what was your strategy?**  

A: Very nice, I like it. You can build the deck in so many different ways, it's not given what deck you will play. You have to be more skillful to do well in the format. It's very difficult to make decks with the pool you get, not like in Tempest and you open the cards and see your deck right away.



**Q: What do you think is the main reason for you making top 8 in this tournament, and why?**  

A: I guess I played as consistent as possible, and aimed for day two in the start, took one match at a time.



**Q: What does this top 8 performance mean to you?**  

A: California!!!



**Q: What are your predictions for the top 8?**  

A: Difficult matchup, depends on the draft and his big topdecking skills...
