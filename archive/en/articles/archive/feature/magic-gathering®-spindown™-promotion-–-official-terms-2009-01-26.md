* Completing Official Answer Sheet: Participants must complete the official answer sheet by locating the five (5) Planeswalker symbols, each corresponding to a specific Planeswalker character, hidden throughout the [www.magicthegathering.com](http://www.magicthegathering.com) website. Once a Planeswalker symbol has been located, participants may click on it to link to an official answer sheet. Once all five (5) Planeswalker symbols have been identified and the names of all five (5) of the corresponding Planeswalker characters have been entered on the official answer sheet, participants must then print the official answer sheet and present it to a representative at a participating store during the specified campaign dates and location determined business hours.
