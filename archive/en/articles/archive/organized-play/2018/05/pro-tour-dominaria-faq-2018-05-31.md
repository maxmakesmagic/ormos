Pro Tour *Dominaria* is here!


**Pro Tour *Dominaria* Begins Tomorrow!**


Follow all the action from Richmond, Virginia, live on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic)! Coverage begins Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at 9 a.m. local time (ET)/6 a.m. PT/1 p.m. UTC.


This three-day extravaganza featuring the world's best players and a whole lot of *Dominaria* Draft and Standard Constructed takes place June 1–3 in Richmond, Virginia, as hundreds go after their share of a quarter of a million dollars!


PRO TOUR *DOMINARIA* BASICS
===========================


Here are the main things to know about Pro Tour *Dominaria* whether you're a Pro Tour newcomer or just want a little refresher on what this weekend is all about:


* The Pro Tour is a three-day, invitation-only event featuring some of greatest *Magic* pros as well as top-finishing Grand Prix competitors, Hall of Famers, and players who found success in Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers that took place a few weeks ago. Those players will be competing for a share of the $250,000 prize pool, with $50,000 going to the winner along with an invitation to the 2018 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.
* Pro Tour *Dominaria* is the third Pro Tour of the 2017–18 season and the third event for the Pro Tour Team Series. For a look at where the teams stand headed into this event, check out the [2017–18 leaderboard](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/protour/teamseries/2017-18-leaderboard).
* With regard to the Team Series, there were three substitutions between the last Pro Tour and this one: on Cardmarket, Robin Dolar was subbed for Thoralf Severin; on EUreka, Immanuel Gerschenson was subbed for Elias Klocker; and for MetaGame Gurus Moon, Nathaniel Smith was subbed for Tom Martell.
* The formats for Friday and Saturday are three rounds of Booster Draft—using three *Dominaria* boosters—and five rounds of Standard Constructed. All matches on Friday and Saturday are best-two-out-of-three games.
* In Standard Constructed, the following sets can be used to assemble a 60-card deck and a sideboard of up to 15 cards: *Kaladesh*, *Aether Revolt*, *Amonkhet*, *Hour of Devastation*, *Ixalan*, *Rivals of Ixalan*, and *Dominaria*.
* All players with 12 or more match points (a 4-4 record or better) at the end of the first day will advance to Day Two of the competition.
* The Top 8 players at the end of Day Two will advance to Sunday's playoff, featuring a traditional single-elimination bracket.
* All matches played on Sunday are best-three-out-of-five Standard Constructed, with the first two games featuring pre-sideboard action.
* The winner gets $50,000, Platinum status in the Pro Tour Players Club for the next four cycles, and an invitation to compete in the 2018 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.
* The $250,000 prize pool pays down to 64th place, awarding a minimum of $1,000. In addition, all players with 33 or more match points at the end of the Pro Tour's Swiss rounds will receive an invitation to compete in the next Pro Tour.

Pro Tour *Dominaria* has a lot, and as always, Rich Hagon does a great job of breaking down [everything you need to know about this Pro Tour](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/pro-tour-dominaria-preview-2018-05-28). But in case you are only looking for quick hits . . .

Key Stories for this Pro Tour
=============================


Outside of crowning a Pro Tour Champion, a few big stories will emerge from this event.


* The [2017–18 race for the Draft Master title](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/top-players/statistics/2017-18-draft-master-standings)—and the 2018 World Championship seat that comes with it—will be decided by Saturday afternoon. Currently, Sweden's Elias Watsfeldt leads this race with two full match wins ahead of Alexander Hayne, Pascal Vieren, and Craig Wescoe, all three tied for second. Will he maintain his lead, or will one of the three runner-up competitors leapfrog him?
* Additionally, the [2017–18 Constructed Master title](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/top-players/statistics/2017-18-constructed-master-standings) will be awarded to someone after Swiss rounds are complete. Again, a World Championship seat is on the line. While John Rolf leads at 49 match points, both Brian Braun-Duin and Immanuel Gerschenson trail by only 1 match point, and another six or more players could be in the running as well. This race is hardly decided, and we'll see it all shake out on Saturday.
* Finally, the Top 16 teams in the [2017–18 Pro Tour Team Series](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/protour/teamseries/2017-18-leaderboard) will be decided at the end of this Pro Tour. The Top 16 teams all guarantee their place at Pro Tour 25th Anniversary in Minneapolis, Minnesota, August 3–5.
