Here on Magic Arcana we've seen several other examples of *Mirrodin* playtest cards ([here](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-playtest-cards-iii-strictly-better-2003-11-13), [here](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-playtest-cards-ii-2003-11-03), and [here](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-playtest-cards-2003-10-27)). In those cases, the cards' mechanics were in flux as much as their flavor.


Today we look at playtest versions of the [artifact lands](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/rb87), that common cycle of nonbasic lands that fuel everything from [Myr Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Myr%2BEnforcer) to [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog). In these early versions, these five lands (now known as [Ancient Den](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Den), [Seat of the Synod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod), [Vault of Whispers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+of+Whispers), [Great Furnace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace), and [Tree of Tales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tree+of+Tales)) are mechanically identical to their final counterparts, but they bore short, simple playtest names.


Can you match each playtest name to its finalized *Mirrodin* name? We've blurred out the color of mana that each produces, so you only have the name to go on. *Note: the basic land card frames behind the playtest stickers are no help either!* (Click each image for the answer.)
