You're a hip, plugged-in member of the **Magic** community. You probably noticed the similarities between [Realms Uncharted](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Realms+Uncharted) and [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) right away.
