### Shock Flavor Text Vote Redux


For last week’s [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) vote there was an error because a real-world quote slipped through to the finalist list (the rules for the promotion specified that all submissions had to be original). The vote was cancelled so that we could run it today, with the 11th place finalist now moving up to fill the slot vacated by Mark Twain. Here then is the corrected vote for [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)’s flavor text.


1. *"At first my hair stood on end. Then I smelled it burning."*
2. *"They say lightning's the mother of fire. Guess what? You're about to become the father."  

 -Jaya Ballard, task mage*
3. *"Lightning is like a troll: you don't know what hit you till you smell it."  

 -Flegren, goblin seer*
4. *"You know what I like best about lightning? It's like fire, but even faster."  

 -Jaya Ballard, task mage*
5. *"That's the problem with the high ground," mused Grognak. "It's too close to the sky!"*
6. *"More fun than a barrel of rocks! More effective too."  

 -Toggo, goblin weaponsmith*
7. *"Sparks fly when you're having fun!"  

 -Snogg, goblin pyromancer*
8. *Once in a while, static electricity ceases to be static.*
9. *This is why there are no furry goblins.*
10. *"Once I saw a goblin shouting at a thunderstorm. He lost the argument pretty quickly."  

 -Wandering mage*
