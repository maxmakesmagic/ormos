Magic Online Prereleases Reimagined

The worst thing about the Prerelease experience is that, when you're done, all you really want to do is Prerelease some more. Prereleases are like Christmas, where you get to unwrap your presents and play with them right then and there.


But what about a second Prerelease?


You see, *Magic Online* is on a slightly different schedule, and the *Magic Online* Prerelease actually offers a second chance to open your first planeswalker. We've run these for every set for quite some time, so if you haven't experienced a *Magic Online* Prerelease, now is as good a time as any.


Especially since we're making a number of improvements to our online Prerelease experience—which, in this case, kicks off April 15.


Change Up
=========


Late last year, we asked players to give feedback on our Prereleases. The [results from this](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-feedback-results%E2%80%94survey-one-2015-11-23) showed that players were unhappy with Prerelease entry options as well as the prizes offered.


So we're changing things up! Both the Prerelease Sealed League and Prerelease Swiss Draft will cost the same number of event tickets that Release events normally would, and offer the same prize structures. Additionally, you'll get an avatar for participating in either event, plus an extra foil mythic rare or rare in the Prerelease Sealed League.


Wait...Prerelease League? Yes! You read that correctly. Sealed League technology is awesome, and we are excited to incorporate it into our Prerelease events. We hope that the use of a League as well as the changes to entry options and prizes will make *Magic Online* Prereleases better than ever and more players will be excited to join them!


How this will work is both the Prerelease Sealed League and Draft queue will begin at the usual time, Friday, April 15, at 10 a.m. PT. You can join both through Monday, April 18, at 10 a.m. PT, and at that time the Prerelease Draft will end and the Prerelease Sealed League will close to new entries. Courses in progress will have until Wednesday, April 20, at 10 a.m. PT to finish matches. You can see the full event details at the bottom of this article.

Release Events
==============


So what are the Release events? Well...we've decided once the Prereleases are over, players will be best served by our normal offerings, and we don't really need Release events. So let's try this again:


~~Release Events~~
==================


There. Much better.


We're no longer going to have Release events. Monday, April 18, at 10 a.m. PT, the regular *Shadows over Innistrad* Sealed League will begin, all three normal *Shadows over Innistrad* Draft queues will begin, and *Shadows over Innistrad* will go on sale in the *Magic Online* store.


Additionally, the downtime people dislike the most is the one right after the new set. You just want to play more games, and we want to let you do that. So this downtime is canceled! When analyzing the events in light of this, we decided we're going to go ahead and change Constructed prizes on Monday, April 18, at 10 a.m. PT as well. For a few minutes, we'll have to pause the Leagues and remove/replace the queues, so if you're on right then, pay attention to [@MagicOnline](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline) on Twitter to know when the changes have been implemented.


I hope you're as excited about these event changes as we are to bring them to you. If you have feedback on these events or other *Magic Online* items, you can give it to us through the official [*Magic Online* Twitter account](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline), my [personal Twitter account](https://twitter.com/mtg_lee), the [*Magic Online* Tumblr](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/), or via email at [magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com](mailto:magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com).
