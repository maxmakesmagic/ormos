**Returning Mechanics**



All cards in the *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* set have previously appeared in other *Magic* sets. Accordingly, several keywords and other mechanics make their return.



**Affinity for artifacts**



First appearing in *Mirrodin*, affinity for artifacts causes spells you cast to cost less for each artifact you control.



The official rules for affinity are as follows:



702.40. Affinity



702.40a Affinity is a static ability that functions while the spell is on the stack. "Affinity for [text]" means "This spell costs you 1 less to cast for each [text] you control."



702.40b The affinity ability reduces only the amount of generic mana a spell's controller has to pay; it doesn't reduce how much colored mana that player has to pay.



702.40c If a spell has multiple instances of affinity, each of them applies.



* Affinity doesn't change the spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. It changes only how much mana you pay to cast the spell.
* The cost reduction is set before you pay any of the spell's costs. Specifically, you could lock in a discount for an artifact you control and then sacrifice that artifact to activate a mana ability.
* If there are any additional costs or cost increases that would apply to a spell with affinity, apply those before applying any cost reductions.




---


**Annihilator**



Annihilator is the signature mechanic of the Eldrazi, first seen in *Rise of the Eldrazi*.



The official rules for annihilator are as follows:



702.85. Annihilator



702.85a Annihilator is a triggered ability. "Annihilator N" means "Whenever this creature attacks, defending player sacrifices N permanents."



702.85b If a creature has multiple instances of annihilator, each triggers separately.



* Annihilator abilities trigger and resolve during the declare attackers step. The defending player chooses and sacrifices the required number of permanents before he or she declares blockers. Any creatures sacrificed this way won't be able to block.
* If a creature with annihilator is attacking a Planeswalker, and the defending player chooses to sacrifice that Planeswalker, the attacking creature continues to attack. It may be blocked. If it isn't blocked, it simply won't deal combat damage to anything.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, the controller of an attacking creature with annihilator chooses which of the defending players is affected by the ability. Only that player sacrifices permanents. The choice is made as the ability resolves; once a player is chosen, it's too late for anyone to respond.




---


**Bloodthirst**



Bloodthirst gives +1/+1 counters to creatures that enter the battlefield on the same turn an opponent was dealt damage. It originally appeared in *Guildpact*.



The official rules for bloodthirst are as follows:



702.53. Bloodthirst



702.53a Bloodthirst is a static ability. "Bloodthirst N" means "If an opponent was dealt damage this turn, this permanent enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on it."



702.53b "Bloodthirst X" is a special form of bloodthirst. "Bloodthirst X" means "This permanent enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it, where X is the total damage your opponents have been dealt this turn."



702.53c If an object has multiple instances of bloodthirst, each applies separately.



* Bloodthirst checks for any kind of damage, not just combat damage.
* Life loss that isn't caused by damage (for example, the life loss caused by Sign in Blood) doesn't cause a creature with bloodthirst to enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters.
* It doesn't matter who controlled the source that dealt damage to an opponent.
* No cards in this set have bloodthirst X.




---


**Convoke**



Convoke lets your creatures help you cast your spells. It first appeared in *Ravnica: City of Guilds* and most recently appeared in the *Magic 2015* core set.



The official rules for convoke are as follows:



702.50. Convoke



702.50a Convoke is a static ability that functions while the spell with convoke is on the stack. "Convoke" means "For each colored mana in this spell's total cost, you may tap an untapped creature of that color you control rather than pay that mana. For each generic mana in this spell's total cost, you may tap an untapped creature you control rather than pay that mana." The convoke ability isn't an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost of the spell with convoke is determined.



702.50b Multiple instances of convoke on the same spell are redundant.



* The rules for convoke have changed slightly since its first appearance, although they haven't changed since the mechanic's appearance in the *Magic 2015* core set. Before then, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
* Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. For example, the converted mana cost of Overwhelm (which has mana cost 5GG) is 7 even if you tapped seven creatures to cast it.
* When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated. For example, if there is a Lodestone Golem on the battlefield (which makes nonartifact spells cost 1 more to cast), then you could tap six creatures and pay GG to cast Overwhelm (which has mana cost 5GG).
* Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs (such as evoke).
* Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for 1 or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
* When using convoke to cast a spell with X in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost XGGG) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is 3GGG . If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay 1G.
* If a creature you control has a mana ability with T in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.




---


**Evoke**



Evoke lets you pay an alternative cost to cast a creature spell. That creature will then be sacrificed, but you'll be able to access its enters-the-battlefield or leaves-the-battlefield ability for less mana. Evoke first appeared in *Lorwyn*.



The official rules for evoke are as follows:



702.73. Evoke



702.73a Evoke represents two abilities: a static ability that functions in any zone from which the card with evoke can be cast and a triggered ability that functions on the battlefield. "Evoke [cost]" means "You may cast this card by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "When this permanent enters the battlefield, if its evoke cost was paid, its controller sacrifices it." Paying a card's evoke cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e–g.



* The creature's enters-the-battlefield or leaves-the-battlefield ability functions whether you pay the evoke cost or not. You can cast these spells as normal and the creature won't be sacrificed.
* Casting a spell for its evoke cost follows all the rules for casting that spell. It doesn't change when you can cast that spell.
* Evoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
* If you cast a spell without paying its mana cost, you can't use its evoke ability. (Then again, you probably wouldn't want to.)




---


**Exalted**



Exalted gives a bonus to a creature that attacks alone. Exalted originally appeared in *Shards of Alara*.



The official rules for exalted are as follows:



702.82. Exalted



702.82a Exalted is a triggered ability. "Exalted" means "Whenever a creature you control attacks alone, that creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn."



702.82b A creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as an attacker in a given combat phase. See rule 506.5.



* If you declare exactly one creature as an attacker, each exalted ability on each permanent you control (including, perhaps, the attacking creature itself) will trigger. The bonuses are given to the attacking creature, not to the permanent with exalted. Ultimately, the attacking creature will wind up with +1/+1 for each of your exalted abilities.
* You must attack with exactly one creature in order for exalted abilities to trigger. Exalted abilities won't trigger if you attack a player with one creature and a Planeswalker with another, for example.
* Some cards with exalted abilities have other abilities that also trigger when a creature you control attacks alone. Each time a creature you control attacks alone, both the exalted ability and the other ability will trigger.
* If you attack with multiple creatures, and all but one are removed from combat, your exalted abilities won't trigger.
* Some effects put creatures onto the battlefield attacking. Since those creatures were never declared as attackers, they're ignored by exalted abilities. They won't cause exalted abilities to trigger. If any exalted abilities have already triggered (because exactly one creature was declared as an attacker), those abilities will resolve as normal even though there may now be multiple attackers.
* Exalted abilities resolve before blockers are declared.
* Exalted bonuses last until end of turn. If an effect creates an additional combat phase during your turn, a creature that attacked alone during the first combat phase will still have its exalted bonuses in the new phase. If a creature attacks alone during the second combat phase, all your exalted abilities will trigger again.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, a creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as an attacker by your entire team. If you control that attacking creature, your exalted abilities will trigger but your teammate's exalted abilities won't.




---


**Graft**



Graft gives your creatures interchangeable parts: +1/+1 counters that can be placed on other creatures. Graft originally appeared in *Dissension*.



The official rules for graft are as follows:



702.57. Graft



702.57a Graft represents both a static ability and a triggered ability. "Graft N" means "This permanent enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on it" and "Whenever another creature enters the battlefield, if this permanent has a +1/+1 counter on it, you may move a +1/+1 counter from this permanent onto that creature."



702.57b If a creature has multiple instances of graft, each one works separately.



* You choose whether to move a +1/+1 counter as the graft ability resolves. Once that ability starts to resolve, it's too late for anyone to respond, whether you decide to add a +1/+1 counter to the creature that has just entered the battlefield or not.
* The graft ability will trigger no matter who controls the creature that entered the battlefield. You can move a +1/+1 counter onto a creature controlled by an opponent.
* The graft ability doesn't target any permanent. You could move a +1/+1 counter onto a creature with shroud, for example.
* If a creature with graft and another creature enter the battlefield simultaneously, the graft ability will trigger. The ability's controller may move a +1/+1 counter onto the other creature.
* Many creatures with graft also have an activated ability that targets a creature with a +1/+1 counter on it. In most cases, that means it can target itself. The target creature may have any number of +1/+1 counters on it. The target creature doesn't need to have graft.
* If the target of such an activated ability loses all its +1/+1 counters before the ability resolves, the ability will be countered for having an illegal target. If the target creature loses all its +1/+1 counters after the ability resolves, it won't lose the bonus it was granted by the ability.




---


**Living weapon**



Living weapon is a signature Phyrexian mechanic that combines an Equipment with a host body. It originally appeared in *Mirrodin Besieged*.



The official rules for living weapon are as follows:



702.91. Living Weapon



702.91a Living weapon is a triggered ability. "Living weapon" means "When this Equipment enters the battlefield, put a 0/0 black Germ creature token onto the battlefield, then attach this Equipment to it."



* Like other Equipment, an Equipment with living weapon has an equip cost. You can pay this cost to attach that Equipment to another creature you control. Once the Germ token is no longer equipped, it will be put into your graveyard, unless another effect raises its toughness above 0.




---


**Persist**



Persist makes creatures especially difficult to kill for good. It originally appeared in *Shadowmoor*.



The official rules for persist are as follows:



702.78. Persist



702.78a Persist is a triggered ability. "Persist" means "When this permanent is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, if it had no -1/-1 counters on it, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control with a -1/-1 counter on it."



* The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
* If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.
* If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
* When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
* If multiple creatures with persist die at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of his or her persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.




---


**Proliferate**



Proliferate is a keyword action that lets you increase the number of counters on players and permanents. It first appeared in *Scars of Mirrodin*.



The official rules for proliferate are as follows:



701.24. Proliferate



701.24a To proliferate means to choose any number of permanents and/or players that have a counter, then give each exactly one additional counter of a kind that permanent or player already has.



701.24b If a permanent or player chosen this way has more than one kind of counter, the player who is proliferating chooses which kind of counter to add.



701.24c To proliferate in a Two-Headed Giant game means to choose any number of permanents and/or teams that have a counter, then give each exactly one additional counter of a kind that permanent or team already has. See rule 810, "Two-Headed Giant Variant."



* You can choose any players that have counters, including yourself.
* You can choose any permanents that have counters, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them, such as suspended cards or a Lightning Storm on the stack.
* You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
* If a permanent chosen this way has multiple kinds of counters on it, only a single new counter is put on that permanent.
* The proliferate ability doesn't target any permanent or player. For example, you could add a second -1/-1 counter to a creature with hexproof controlled by your opponent, or add a second poison counter to an opponent with hexproof.
* Players can respond to the spell or ability whose effect includes the instruction to proliferate. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.




---


**Wither**



Damage dealt to a creature by a source with wither is especially harmful. Wither originally appeared in *Shadowmoor*.



The official rules for wither are as follows:



702.79. Wither



702.79a Wither is a static ability. Damage dealt to a creature by a source with wither isn't marked on that creature. Rather, it causes that many -1/-1 counters to be put on that creature. See rule 119.3.



702.79b If a permanent leaves the battlefield before an effect causes it to deal damage, its last known information is used to determine whether it had wither.



702.79c The wither rules function no matter what zone an object with wither deals damage from.



702.79d Multiple instances of wither on the same object are redundant.



* Wither's effect applies to any damage, not just combat damage.
* The -1/-1 counters remain on the creature indefinitely. They won't be removed if the creature regenerates or the turn ends.
* Since damage from a source with wither is still damage, it follows all the other rules for damage. It can be prevented or redirected. Other abilities that apply to damage dealt, such as lifelink and deathtouch, will work normally.
* Damage from sources with wither affects players and Planeswalkers (that aren't also creatures) normally.




---


**Hybrid mana, monocolored hybrid mana, and Phyrexian mana**



Hybrid mana symbols represent costs that can be paid with either of two colors of mana. For example, W/U can be paid with either W or U. It's both a blue mana symbol and a white mana symbol.



Monocolored hybrid mana symbols represent costs that can be paid with one mana of a certain color or with two mana of any color. For example, 2/G can be paid with either 2 or G. It's a green mana symbol.



Phyrexian mana symbols represent costs that can be paid either with one mana of a certain color or by paying 2 life. Phyrexian mana symbols appear as the Phyrexian insignia (a circle with a slash through it) on one of five colored backgrounds, each corresponding to one of the five colors of mana. For example, G/P can be paid with either G or 2 life. It's a green mana symbol.



* When calculating the converted mana cost of a card, each hybrid mana symbol and Phyrexian mana symbol counts as 1. Each monocolored hybrid mana symbol counts as 2.
* You choose how you're going to pay for any of the above symbols as you're casting the spell or activating the ability with a cost that includes them.
* If you have 1 or less life, you can't pay 2 life to pay for a Phyrexian mana symbol.
* Phyrexian mana is not a color. You can't add Phyrexian mana to your mana pool.

* The two target creatures may be the same creature or they may be different creatures.
* If the targets are different creatures, and one of the targets becomes illegal before Agony Warp resolves, Agony Warp will still affect the remaining legal target. In this case, however, you can’t change which effect applies to it. For example, if the second target becomes illegal, you can’t then decide to give the first target -0/-3 instead of -3/-0.

* A colored permanent is a permanent with one or more colors.
* Lands have no mana cost, so they are colorless unless something states otherwise.
* All colored permanents are sacrificed at the same time.
* All Is Dust doesn’t destroy permanents. Rather, it causes them to be sacrificed. Regeneration and indestructible can’t save permanents from All Is Dust.

* All Suns’ Dawn may be cast with zero to five targets, one for each color.

* The first ability checks the number you chose for X, not the amount of mana you actually spent or the number of +1/+1 counters Apocalypse Hydra entered the battlefield with.
* If a spell or ability allows you to cast Apocalypse Hydra without paying its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X.

* You choose what the target artifact or creature gains protection from as Apostle’s Blessing resolves. Once you’ve chosen, it’s too late for an opponent to respond to the creature gaining protection from your choice.
* If a creature enchanted with an Aura gains protection from that Aura’s color, that Aura will become unattached and be put into its owner’s graveyard. If an equipped creature gains protection from artifacts, any Equipment attached to it will become unattached and remain on the battlefield.

* Once Argent Sphinx’s ability is activated, it will resolve as normal and exile Argent Sphinx even if you cease to control three or more artifacts before it resolves. Likewise, Argent Sphinx will return to the battlefield no matter how many artifacts you control at the beginning of the next end step.
* If Argent Sphinx’s metalcraft ability exiles it during an end step, Argent Sphinx will return to the battlefield at the beginning of the next turn’s end step.
* If you temporarily gain control of an Argent Sphinx owned by another player and activate its metalcraft ability, it will return to the battlefield under your control. You’ll retain control of it indefinitely.

* Banefire checks the number you chose for X, not the amount of mana you actually spent.
* Banefire can be targeted by spells or abilities that try to counter it (such as Remand) regardless of what the value of X is. If X is 5 or more, those spells will still resolve, but the effect that would counter Banefire won’t do anything. Any other effects those spells have will work as normal. For example, Remand won’t counter Banefire or return it to its owner’s hand if X is 5 or more, but the controller of Remand will still draw a card.
* Banefire’s ability won’t prevent it from being countered by the game rules if its target becomes illegal, for instance by gaining protection from red.

* The last ability can target any Blinkmoth creature, including an animated Blinkmoth Nexus or a creature with changeling.
* If Blinkmoth Nexus becomes a creature but hasn’t continuously been under its controller’s control since that player’s most recent turn began, Blinkmoth Nexus won’t be able to attack and its abilities with T in the cost (including its mana ability) won’t be able to be activated. In other words, look at how long the permanent itself has been under your control, not how long it’s been a creature.
* Activating the ability that turns Blinkmoth Nexus into a creature while it’s already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number. However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as an effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.

* If the number of charge counters on Chimeric Mass changes while it’s a creature, its power and toughness will change accordingly.
* If you activate Chimeric Mass’s last ability while it has no charge counters on it, it will become a 0/0 creature and be put into its owner’s graveyard as a state-based action (unless something else is raising its toughness).
* Activating the last ability while Chimeric Mass is a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to another number, but effects that modify power and/or toughness without directly setting them will still apply.
* For example, say you activate the last ability of a Chimeric Mass with three charge counters on it. After it resolves, you cast Giant Growth targeting it. It’s now 6/6. Then Diminish (“Target creature has base power and toughness 1/1 until end of turn”) is cast targeting it. Once Diminish resolves, Chimeric Mass will be 4/4. Activating Chimeric Mass’s last ability a second time will make it 6/6 again until end of turn.

* Combust can be targeted by spells and abilities that try to counter it (such as Remand). Those spells and abilities will resolve, but the effect that would counter Combust won’t do anything. Any other effects those spells and abilities have will work as normal. For example, Remand won’t counter Combust or return it to its owner’s hand, but the controller of Remand will still draw a card.
* Combust’s ability won’t prevent it from being countered by the game rules if its target becomes illegal, for instance by gaining protection from red.
* Spells that create prevention effects affecting the target creature can still be cast, and abilities that create prevention effects affecting the target creature can still be activated. However, damage prevention shields (including those created before Combust was cast) have no effect on the damage dealt by Combust. If such a prevention effect has an additional effect, the additional effect will still work (if possible).
* If a static ability would prevent damage from being dealt to the target creature, it fails to prevent the damage dealt by Combust. If that ability has an additional effect that doesn’t depend on the amount of damage prevented, that additional effect will still work. It’s applied just once as Combust resolves.
* Effects that replace or redirect damage without using the word “prevent” aren’t affected by Combust; they’ll work as normal.
* If a creature is dealt lethal damage by Combust, it can still regenerate. If it does, the damage marked on it will be removed from it.

No player can respond during the casting process.

* For example, if you want Comet Storm to deal 4 damage to each of three different targets, then X is 4 and you’re kicking the spell twice. You pay the mana cost of 4RR plus two kicker costs of 1 each for a total cost of 6RR.
* As long as any of Comet Storm’s targets are legal at the time Comet Storm resolves, it will deal X damage to each of those legal targets.

* If Electrolyze has two targets, and one (but not both) of those targets becomes illegal before Electrolyze resolves, you can’t change the division of damage. Damage that would’ve been dealt to illegal targets is simply lost.
* You can’t deal damage to both a player and a planeswalker that player controls using Electrolyze. You also can’t deal damage to more than one planeswalker controlled by the same player. If you choose to redirect the damage Electrolyze is dealing a player to a planeswalker that player controls, you must redirect all the damage to a single planeswalker.
* If an effect creates a copy of Electrolyze, the division of damage and number of targets can’t be changed. The effect that creates the copy will likely allow you to change the targets, however.

* Emrakul can be targeted by spells that try to counter it (like Remand). Those spells will resolve, but the part of their effect that would counter Emrakul won’t do anything. Any other effects those spells have will work as normal. For example, Remand won’t counter Emrakul or return it to its owner’s hand, but the controller of Remand will still draw a card.
* "Protection from colored spells” means that Emrakul can’t be the target of colored spells (including colored Aura spells) or of abilities whose sources are colored spells (such as the “when you cast” ability of an Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre that’s been turned red by Painter’s Servant). It also means that all damage that would be dealt to Emrakul by colored spells is prevented. Like every protection ability, it works only while Emrakul is on the battlefield.
* “Colored spells” is not synonymous with “colored instants and sorceries.” For example, if a player cycles Resounding Wave, its triggered ability may target Emrakul because Resounding Wave wasn’t cast as a spell.
* Emrakul may be affected by colored spells that don’t target it or deal damage to it, including those that cause it to become blocked. Abilities of colored permanents (such as Journey to Nowhere) may target it. Auras may be moved onto it by abilities or by colored spells that don’t target it (such as Aura Graft).

* When Ghost Council of Orzhova is exiled, any Auras or Equipment on it become unattached and any counters on it are removed. When it returns to the battlefield, it comes back untapped and is treated as a new permanent with no connection to the last time it was on the battlefield.

Then Diminish (“Target creature has base power and toughness 1/1 until end of turn”) is cast targeting it. Once Diminish resolves, Glint Hawk Idol will be 4/4.

* If one or more of the creatures blocking Guile stop blocking it for any reason, it won’t change that Guile was blocked.
* Guile’s second ability replaces countering a spell with exiling it and the chance to cast it immediately without paying its mana cost. If you choose not to cast it as this ability resolves (or can’t, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), it remains exiled. If the spell or ability that tried to counter the spell has additional effects, it then continues to resolve.
* Because you’re already casting the spell using an alternative cost (by casting it without paying its mana cost), you can’t pay any other alternative costs for the card, including casting it face down using the morph ability. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the exiled card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value for X when casting it.
* If a spell or ability you control tries to counter a spell that can’t be countered, it doesn’t. Since the spell wouldn’t be countered, Guile’s ability has no effect on it. The spell will continue to resolve normally.
* The last ability triggers when Guile is put into its owner’s graveyard from any zone, not just from the battlefield. That ability triggers from the graveyard. For example, if Guile is manifested and then dies, its last ability will trigger.
* If Guile leaves the graveyard before its last ability resolves, the library isn’t shuffled.

* If two Hellkite Chargers attack at the same time, both of their abilities trigger. If you pay 5RR for each, two new combat phases will be created. However, all attacking creatures untap as those abilities resolve, not as the combat phases start. Any creature that attacks in the second combat phase will remain tapped during the third combat phase.

* Hurkyl’s Recall will return each artifact on the battlefield owned by the target player to his or her hand no matter who controls each of them.
* None of the artifacts are targets of Hurkyl’s Recall. For example, an artifact with hexproof may be returned to its owner’s hand this way.

* When the ability resolves, it counts the number of times the same ability from the same creature has already resolved that turn. It doesn’t matter who controlled the creature or the previous abilities when they resolved. A copy of this ability that’s resolved (such as one created by Rings of Brighthearth) will count toward the total. Abilities from other creatures with the same name won’t count towards the total. Abilities that were countered or otherwise removed from the stack won’t count. Abilities still on the stack also won’t count.

* Iona’s third ability includes permanent spells (artifacts, creatures, enchantments, and planeswalkers), not just instant and sorcery spells. It doesn’t affect lands or abilities of permanents of the chosen color.
* Once the color is chosen, it’s too late for opponents to respond by casting spells of that color. For example, there’s no way for an opponent to destroy Iona, Shield of Emeria by casting Doom Blade if the chosen color is black.

> 
> 



* Karn’s first and third abilities are linked. Similarly, Karn’s second and third abilities are linked. Only cards exiled by either of Karn’s first two abilities will remain in exile when the game restarts.
* To restart a game with Karn’s third ability, immediately end the current game. The players in that game then immediately begin a new game. No player wins, loses, or draws the original game as a result of Karn’s third ability.
* In a multiplayer game (a game that started with three or more players in it), any player that left the game before it was restarted with Karn’s third ability won’t be involved in the new game.
* The player who controlled the ability that restarted the game is the starting player in the new game. The new game starts like a game normally does:
	+ Each player shuffles his or her deck (except the cards left in exile by Karn’s ability).
	+ Each player’s life total becomes 20 (or the starting life total for whatever format you’re playing).
	+ Each player draws a hand of seven cards. Players may take mulligans.
	+ Players may take actions based on cards in their opening hands, such as Chancellors and Leylines.
* After the start-of-game procedure is complete, but before the new game’s first turn, Karn’s third ability finishes resolving and the cards left in exile are put onto the battlefield. If this causes any triggered abilities to trigger, those abilities are put onto the stack at the beginning of the first upkeep step.
* Creatures put onto the battlefield due to Karn’s third ability will have been under their controller’s control continuously since the beginning of the first turn. They can attack and their activated abilities with T in the cost can be activated that turn.
* Any permanents put onto the battlefield with Karn’s third ability that entered the battlefield tapped will untap during their controller’s first untap step.
* No actions taken in the game that was restarted apply to the new game. For example, if you were dealt damage by Stigma Lasher in the original game, the effect that states you can’t gain life doesn’t carry over to the new game.
* Players won’t have any poison counters or emblems they had in the original game.
* In a Commander game, players put their commanders into the command zone before shuffling their decks.
* The number of times a player has cast his or her commander from the command zone resets to zero. Also, the amount of combat damage dealt to players by each commander is reset to 0.
* If a player’s commander was exiled with Karn and the game restarted, that commander won’t be put into the command zone at the beginning of the game. It will be put onto the battlefield when Karn’s third ability finishes resolving. It remains its owner’s commander.
* In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option, all players are affected and will restart the game, not just those within the range of influence of the ability’s controller.

* The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below), plus it has haste. It doesn’t copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or whether it’s been affected by any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If the copied creature has X in its mana cost (such as Apocalypse Hydra), X is 0.
* If the copied creature is copying something else when the ability resolves (for example, if the copied creature is a Clone), then the token enters the battlefield as a copy of whatever that creature is copying, plus it has haste.
* If the copied creature is a token, the token created by Kiki-Jiki’s ability copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield, plus it has haste.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token is put onto the battlefield. Any “as [this creature] enters the battlefield” or “[this creature] enters the battlefield with” abilities of the copied creature will also work. (Note that the token wasn’t cast, so if it’s a copy of a creature with sunburst, it won’t enter with +1/+1 counters.)
* The token will not be kicked, even if the creature it’s copying was.
* The token is sacrificed at the beginning of the next end step regardless of who controls it at that time.
* If Kiki-Jiki’s activated ability resolves during a turn’s end step, the token will be sacrificed at the beginning of the next turn’s end step.
* If the token isn’t sacrificed following the delayed triggered ability being placed on the stack (due to Voidslime, perhaps), it remains on the battlefield indefinitely. It continues to have haste.
* If another creature becomes or enters the battlefield as a copy of the token, that creature will have haste, but you won’t sacrifice it. However, if Kiki-Jiki’s ability creates multiple tokens copying a single creature due to a replacement effect (like the one Doubling Season creates), you’ll sacrifice each of them.

* Your “opening hand” is the hand of cards you decide to start the game with after taking any mulligans.
* After all players have kept their opening hands, if the starting player has any Leylines in his or her hand, he or she may put any or all of them onto the battlefield. Then each other player in turn order may do the same.
* Leylines that start the game on the battlefield aren’t cast as spells. They can’t be countered.
* After each player has exercised his or her option to put Leylines onto the battlefield, the first turn of the game begins.

* The ability affects the total cost of each nonartifact spell, but it doesn’t change that spell’s mana cost or converted mana cost. The extra mana also doesn’t change how many times you kicked the spell or what the value of X is (if applicable).
* When determining a spell’s total cost, effects that increase the cost are applied before effects that reduce the cost.

* The ability that defines Matca Rioters’s power and toughness works in all zones, not just the battlefield.
* The number of basic land types among lands you control is between zero and five, depending on if you control a Plains, an Island, a Swamp, a Mountain, and/or a Forest. It doesn’t matter how many lands of each type you control, as long as you control at least one.
* Some nonbasic lands have basic land types. For example, if you control a Hallowed Fountain (a Plains Island), a Mountain, and a Forest, Matca Rioters will be 4/4.

* Narcolepsy’s triggered ability has an “intervening ‘if’ clause.” That means the ability triggers only if the enchanted creature is untapped as any player’s upkeep begins, and the ability does nothing if the enchanted creature is already tapped by the time it resolves.
* Narcolepsy doesn’t keep the enchanted creature continually tapped. The creature untaps during its controller’s untap step as normal, then is tapped when Narcolepsy’s ability resolves during that upkeep. The creature may be tapped in response (for example, if it has an activated ability with T in its cost).

* It doesn’t matter how many -1/-1 counters were on the creature when it was put into a graveyard from the battlefield, as long as it had at least one.
* If a creature that has +1/+1 counters on it dies following the addition of -1/-1 counters due to having lethal damage or toughness equal to or less than 0, it will return to the battlefield under your control. That’s because Necroskitter’s triggered ability checks the creature’s existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.
* The card returns to the battlefield without any -1/-1 counters on it (unless another effect causes it to enter the battlefield with some).

* If Oblivion Ring leaves the battlefield before its first ability has resolved, its second ability will trigger and do nothing. Then its first ability will resolve and exile the targeted nonland permanent indefinitely. (Note that Oblivion Ring’s abilities work differently from more recent abilities such as the one Banisher Priest has.)
* If the exiled card is an Aura, that card’s owner chooses what it will enchant as it comes back onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn’t target anything, but the Aura’s enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If the Aura can’t legally be attached to anything, it remains exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners’ graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
* If there are no nonland permanents on the battlefield other than an Oblivion Ring, and the card it exiled was another Oblivion Ring, casting a third Oblivion Ring will result in an involuntary infinite loop that will end the game in a draw (unless someone chooses to break it by putting another nonland permanent onto the battlefield or destroying one of the Oblivion Rings, for example).

* The second ability triggers whenever a player casts an instant or sorcery spell that targets only one Golem. That Golem can be Precursor Golem itself, one of the Golem tokens it created, or any other Golem. It doesn’t matter who controls the Golem.
* If an instant or sorcery spell has multiple targets, but it’s targeting the same Golem with all of them (such as Agony Warp targeting the same Golem twice), Precursor Golem’s last ability will trigger.
* Any Golem that couldn’t be targeted by the original spell (due to shroud, protection abilities, targeting restrictions, or any other reason) is just ignored by Precursor Golem’s second ability.
* The controller of the spell that caused Precursor Golem’s second ability to trigger also controls all the copies. That player chooses the order the copies are put onto the stack. The original spell will already be on the stack beneath those copies and will resolve last.
* The copies that Precursor Golem’s second ability creates are created on the stack, so they’re not “cast.” Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like Precursor Golem’s second ability itself) won’t trigger.
* If the spell that’s copied is modal (that is, it says “Choose one —” or the like), the copies will have the same mode. Their controller can’t choose a different one.
* If the spell that’s copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Banefire does), the copies have the same value of X.
* The controller of a copy can’t choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, the copies can’t be kicked if the original spell wasn’t, but if the original spell was kicked, the copies will be as well.

* If you control three or more artifacts at the time Rusted Relic enters the battlefield (including Rusted Relic itself), any abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield will trigger.
* Whether or not Rusted Relic can attack depends on how long the permanent itself has been under your control, not how long it’s been a creature. Specifically, if you’ve controlled Rusted Relic continuously since the beginning of your turn, and Rusted Relic becomes a creature that turn, it can attack.
* If Rusted Relic stops being a creature during combat (because you lose control of one or more artifacts, perhaps), it is removed from combat and will not deal or be dealt combat damage. Creatures it was blocking remain blocked. If Rusted Relic was attacking, it will remain tapped. It won’t reenter that combat, even if you wind up controlling three or more artifacts again during that combat phase.

* Scute Mob’s ability has an “intervening ‘if’ clause.” That means the ability won’t trigger at all unless you control five or more lands as your upkeep starts, and the ability will do nothing if you control fewer than five lands by the time it resolves.

* Activating Shrewd Hatchling’s ability after it’s been legally blocked won’t change or undo that block.

* If there are no -1/-1 counters on it when the triggered ability resolves, the ability does nothing. There is no penalty for not being able to remove a counter.

It doesn’t matter who controlled the creature or the previous abilities when they resolved. A copy of this ability that’s resolved (such as one created by Rings of Brighthearth) will count toward the total. Abilities from other creatures with the same name won’t count towards the total. Abilities that were countered or otherwise removed from the stack won’t count. Abilities still on the stack also won’t count.
* The ability may produce mana only the third time it resolves each turn. It won’t produce mana the fourth time, the fifth time, the sixth time, and so on.

You can also activate Spellskite’s ability and target a spell or ability with no targets, even though it won’t have any effect.
* If changing one target of a spell or ability to Spellskite would make other targets of that spell or ability illegal, the targets remain unchanged.
* If the spell or ability has multiple instances of the word “target,” you choose which target you’re changing to Spellskite when Spellskite’s ability resolves.
* By activating Spellskite’s ability multiple times, you can change each target of a spell or ability with multiple instances of the word “target” to Spellskite, one at a time.
* The target of the spell or ability won’t change unless Spellskite fulfills all the targeting criteria, even if multiple instances of the word “target” are used. For example, you can’t change both targets of Arc Trail to Spellskite.
* If a spell or ability has multiple targets but doesn’t use the word “target” multiple times, such as Fulgent Distraction, you can only successfully change one of the targets to Spellskite.
* If a spell or ability has a variable number of targets, you can’t change the number of targets.
* If Spellskite leaves the battlefield before its ability resolves, the targets remain unchanged.

>

> 



* Splinter Twin grants an activated ability to the enchanted creature. That creature’s controller (who is not necessarily the Aura’s controller) can activate it. The creature’s controller is the player who gets the token.
* The token copies exactly what’s printed on the enchanted creature (unless that creature is copying something else or it’s a token; see below), plus it has haste. It doesn’t copy whether the enchanted creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or whether it’s been affected by any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on. In particular, it doesn’t copy the ability granted to the enchanted creature by Splinter Twin.
* If the enchanted creature has X in its mana cost (for instance, if it’s Apocalypse Hydra), X is 0.
* If the enchanted creature is copying something else when the ability resolves (for example, if the copied creature is a Clone), then the token enters the battlefield as a copy of whatever the enchanted creature is copying, plus it has haste.
* If the enchanted creature is a token, the new token copies the original characteristics of the token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield, plus it has haste.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the enchanted creature will trigger when the token is put onto the battlefield. Any “as [this creature] enters the battlefield” or “[this creature] enters the battlefield with” abilities of the enchanted creature will also work. (Note that the token wasn’t cast, so if it’s a copy of a creature with sunburst, it won’t enter with +1/+1 counters.)
* The token will not be kicked, even if the creature it’s copying was.
* If you activate the ability and the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves, you still get a token. The enchanted creature’s last existence on the battlefield is checked to see what it was (specifically, if it was itself or if it was copying something else).
* The token is exiled at the beginning of the next end step regardless of who controls it at that time, or whether Splinter Twin or the enchanted creature is still on the battlefield at that time.
* If the ability resolves during a turn’s end step, the token will be exiled at the beginning of the next turn’s end step.
* If the token isn’t exiled following the delayed triggered ability being placed on the stack (due to Voidslime, perhaps), it remains on the battlefield indefinitely. It continues to have haste.
* If another creature becomes or enters the battlefield as a copy of the token, that creature will have haste, but you won’t exile it. However, if the ability Splinter Twin grants the enchanted creature creates multiple tokens copying a single creature due to a replacement effect (like the one Doubling Season creates), you’ll exile each of them.

* For the purpose of determining whether the cost reduction applies, the number of artifacts you control is checked as you cast Stoic Rebuttal, before you can activate mana abilities to pay for it. For example, if you control three artifacts, you could determine that Stoic Rebuttal costs UU to cast, then sacrifice one of those artifacts to activate a mana ability.

* You can’t activate the ability that lets you search for an instant card unless Sunforger is attached to a creature.
* The card you find must be legal to cast. For example, you must be able to choose a legal target for it if required. If you can’t find such a card, or choose not to, you simply shuffle your library.
* The card is cast from your library. In some unusual cases, the order of your library may be relevant as you cast it. For example, if there’s an additional cost to cast the spell (such as a kicker cost), the order or contents of your library could change while activating mana abilities. In these cases, you must maintain the order of your library as you search it.
* If there’s an X in the mana cost of the card, you must choose 0 as the value of X.
* To cast a split card using Sunforger’s ability, at least one of its halves must be a red or white instant, and at least one of its halves must have converted mana cost 4 or less, but these two halves don’t necessarily have to be the same. You choose which half you’re casting as you cast the spell. For example, you can cast either half of Research/Development, as Research has converted mana cost 2 (even though Development has converted mana cost 5) and Development is red (even though Research is neither red nor white).

* Spells that deal damage specify the source of that damage. It’s often the spell itself, but it could also be a creature, particularly if that spell causes a creature to fight Swans of Bryn Argoll. Similarly, abilities that deal damage will specify the source of that damage, although the source will never be the ability itself. The source of the ability is usually the source of the damage. The source of combat damage is the creature that deals it.
* If the source of the damage is a permanent, Swans of Bryn Argoll checks who that permanent’s controller is at the time the damage is prevented. If the permanent has left the battlefield by then, its last known controller is used. If the source is a card from another zone (such as a cycled Jund Sojourners), Swans of Bryn Argoll checks its owner rather than its controller.
* If a creature with wither or infect would deal damage to Swans of Bryn Argoll, that damage will be prevented as normal. That creature’s controller will draw cards. Swans of Bryn Argoll won’t have any -1/-1 counters put on it.

* The card types that can appear on a card in a graveyard are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal.
* Instants and sorceries are placed in the graveyard as they resolve, before creatures are checked for lethal damage. If a Tarmogoyf is targeted by Lightning Bolt (which deals 3 damage to target creature or player) while a land card and a sorcery card are in the graveyard, upon resolution the Tarmogoyf will take 3 damage, the Lightning Bolt will go to the graveyard, and the Tarmogoyf will become a 3/4 with 3 damage on it prior to the game rules checking it for lethal damage.

* The first ability can target zero, one, or two artifacts. You may activate it with no targets just to put a loyalty counter on Tezzeret.
* For the second ability, you choose the value of X when you activate it. You don’t look through your library until the ability resolves. (In other words, you can’t look through your library, decide what artifact card you want, and then determine what X is.) You can’t choose an X that’s greater than the number of loyalty counters on Tezzeret.
* The third ability affects all artifacts you control, including artifacts that are already creatures.
* Artifacts you control affected by the third ability will retain any other types, subtypes, or supertypes they may have.
* A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its T abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of his or her most recent turn.
* If the third ability affects an artifact that’s already a creature, that ability overrides all previous effects that set the creature’s power or toughness to specific values. However, effects that set its power or toughness to specific values that start to apply after the third ability resolves will override this effect.
* Effects that modify the power and/or toughness of creatures you control, such as the effect of Glorious Anthem, will apply to the creatures no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change their power and/or toughness and effects that switch power and toughness.

* If, during your declare attackers step, Ulamog’s Crusher is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can’t attack, or you haven’t controlled it continuously since the beginning of your turn, then it doesn’t attack. If there’s a cost associated with having Ulamog’s Crusher attack, you aren’t forced to pay that cost, so it doesn’t have to attack in that case either.
* If there are multiple combat phases in a turn, Ulamog’s Crusher must attack in only the first such phase it’s able to.

* This is not the same as hexproof. If, for example, you target one of your opponent’s creatures, your opponents won’t be able to target that creature with spells or abilities.

* First the player whose turn it is chooses which lands he or she will sacrifice. Then each other player in turn order chooses his or her lands. Then all those lands are sacrificed at the same time. Then Wildfire deals damage to each creature.

* A creature that’s green and white will benefit from both of the first two abilities and get +2/+2.
* Wilt-Leaf Liege’s last ability doesn’t use the stack and can’t be responded to.
* If you put Wilt-Leaf Liege onto the battlefield using its last ability, you still discarded it for the purposes of any spell or ability that cares about you discarding cards.

* Wings of Velis Vel overrides all previous effects that set the creature’s power or toughness to specific values. However, effects that set its power or toughness to specific values that start to apply after Wings of Velis Vel resolves will override this effect.
* Effects that modify the power or toughness of the creature, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature’s power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.

* Casting Worldheart Phoenix from your graveyard by paying its alternative cost doesn’t change when you can cast it. Normally, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
* If you cast Worldheart Phoenix this way, it is a spell and can be countered.
* As soon as you start to cast Worldheart Phoenix from your graveyard, the card moves onto the stack. At that point, it’s too late for an opponent to try to stop you from casting it by removing it from your graveyard.

* The “can’t block” effect applies to each of the target creatures— and only those creatures—even if Wrap in Flames deals no damage to one or more of them (due to a prevention effect, for example) or Wrap in Flames deals damage to a different creature (due to a redirection effect).
* If any of the target creatures becomes an illegal target by the time Wrap in Flames resolves, it won’t be dealt damage and will be able to block. The other target creatures will still be affected.
