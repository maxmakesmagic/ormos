As you no doubt have noticed, the *Magic* site has a new look and feel today. We're very excited to launch this! Today's look and feel is a fairly stark contrast to the previous site.

We're very excited with this new look and the new functionality it brings with it. A few of the other improvements with today's launch:



* New desktop menu structure: we move to a vertical menu layout rather than the sometimes difficult to navigate horizontal one for desktop use.
* What we call the carousel, at the top of pages, previously animated onto the screen and now will instead simply be there once the page loads.
* Now on DailyMTG.com you can click anywhere in the article block to load that article rather than having to only click on the Read More link.
* RSS feeds return! See below to learn more, but yes, RSS has finally returned!


RSS
===



Today's launch also returns a requested feature: RSS feeds. Here are links to the RSS feeds for our different sections of the *Magic* site:



* [DailyMTG](http://magic.wizards.com/rss/rss.xml?tags=Daily%20MTG&lang=en)
* [Events](http://magic.wizards.com/en/rss/rss.xml?tags=Event&lang=en)
* [*Magic Online*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/rss/rss.xml?tags=MTGO&lang=en)


We also have the ability to provide RSS by language as well!



DailyMTG
========



Speaking of DailyMTG.com, this design also brings with it a completely new layout for the article sections of the website. Now readers get a grid layout, which is both easier to parse and better looking.

Search
======



Search functionality has been updated and improved as well, but full implementation will take about a week while the site populates. Search should improve incrementally during that time, but we ask for your patience in the meanwhile. We think you’ll be happy with the result.
