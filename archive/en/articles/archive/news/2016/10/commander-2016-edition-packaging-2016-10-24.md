You're welcome. Or I'm sorry. We'll start there.


I'll start off with an apology. You see, I have to be a bit cheeky today. Yes, this article is all about showing you the packaging for *Commander (2016 Edition)*, which, if you've seen *Commander* products in the past, would include the face card.


But I'm not going to show you those. Not yet, at least.


You see, we've got a week of previews on the web, and showing the splashy, flashy, four-color commanders all at once feels a bit anticlimactic. Plus, I enjoy the feeling of power that comes with teasing them out. So let me have this.


That doesn't mean there's nothing to be seen here. You can see the deck names for each of the four-color sets. So there's that. Plus, if you check out [Making *Magic*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/howdy-partner-2016-10-24)Â today, you'll get to see one of the commanders!


Here they are:
