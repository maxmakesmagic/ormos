Eugene Hwang, having won Grand Prix Orlando two weeks ago, started the day as our King of the Hill, and he has held on to his seat for the entire day. This round, Gold level pro Brad Nelson will try to dethrone him.



 Neither of these two players has [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) or [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) in their deck. With the Top 8 of last weekend's Pro Tour being dominated by those two cards, it is easy to forget that *Khans of Tarkir* contains a lot of cards for the other clans as well. Yet, Nelson has a Mardu deck that showcases the power of [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde), and Hwang has a Sultai deck based around [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant). Let's see how they match up!






*Brad Nelson came to battle with Butcher of the Horde.*
