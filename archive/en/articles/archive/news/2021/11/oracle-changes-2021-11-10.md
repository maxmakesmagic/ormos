Here you'll find a list of changes being made to the official Oracle text of some *Magic* cards with the release of the [*Innistrad: Crimson Vow*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/innistrad-crimson-vow) set. Once the update is live, you can find the official text of any card on [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=508148).


Exiling a Graveyard
-------------------


Several cards that exiled all cards from a players graveyard received an update to say that they exile that player's graveyard. This is not a functional change, and it affects the following 26 cards:

Bloodvial Purveyor
------------------


![Bloodvial Purveyor](https://media.wizards.com/2021/vow/en_m5XK6jG9Sq.png)


The words "until end of turn" were inadvertently omitted from the printed card. [Bloodvial Purveyor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodvial+Purveyor)'s corrected Oracle text includes this duration.


**Old text**:


Flying, trample  

Whenever an opponent casts a spell, that player creates a Blood token. *(It's an artifact with "{1}, {T}, Discard a card, Sacrifice this artifact: Draw a card.")*  

Whenever Bloodvial Purveyor attacks, it gets +1/+0 for each Blood token defending player controls.


**New text**:


Flying, trample  

Whenever an opponent casts a spell, that player creates a Blood token. *(It's an artifact with "{1}, {T}, Discard a card, Sacrifice this artifact: Draw a card.")*  

Whenever Bloodvial Purveyor attacks, it gets +1/+0 until end of turn for each Blood token defending player controls.
