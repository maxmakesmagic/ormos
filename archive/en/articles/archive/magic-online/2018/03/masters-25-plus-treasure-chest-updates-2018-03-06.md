*Magic Online* Treasure Chest Update
====================================


*Magic Online* [Treasure Chests](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info) are getting an update with the release of *Masters 25*, as they do for most sets. We're really changing things up this time, with 265 new cards entering the Curated sheet and another 133 leaving. Many other cards will now appear more or less often than they did before.


Many of the cards leaving the Curated sheet are cards from *Commander* releases. Others are old promo cards that have enjoyed a good run but are now being retired. [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) has two promo versions, but only the *Conflux* version will appear now. Some are cards whose popularity has waned, such as [Bristling Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bristling+Hydra). Some others are cards that we're simply rotating out to keep the contents fresh and exciting.


And of course, cards reprinted in *Masters 25* are mostly cut back, with some removed entirely. Opening a Treasure Chest should feel pretty different than opening the boosters you're drafting with.


These removed cards might be back in the future, but for now it's time for some new cards to shine.


We add cards to Treasure Chests all the time, but for this release we're staying on-theme for a Masters set and bringing more than usual into the fold. Of the 265 new cards, fifteen of them are the cards from *From the Vault: Transform*, available on *Magic Online* for the first time. Other beloved old cards are now available, many of them specifically included for Pauper players. Now, you can open [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=21284) from *Nemesis*, [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=265979) from *Duel Decks: Venser vs. Koth*, [Ninja of the Deep Hours](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours), and more. Standard cards show up more often than before, too. And for the first time since they left Standard, cards from *Battle for Zendikar* and *Shadows over Innistrad* blocks can be found in Treasure Chests.


We're also slightly increasing the chance to get a card from the Curated sheet. Slot 2 will yield a Curated card 0.5% more often, with Standard common/uncommon cards appearing slightly less frequently.

In addition to all that, the *Masters 25* update will introduce a brand-new kind of object in Treasure Chests: Treasure Chest Avatars, a small group of untradeable avatars with unique border treatments similar to Prestige Avatars. These avatars lower the frequency of only Standard commons and uncommons. The chances of receiving Play Points or Curated cards is unaffected. And Treasure Chests are the *only* way to get these avatars.


(For all fans of the Standard-legal commons and uncommons in Treasure Chests out there, you have my sincerest apologies at the reduction in frequency.)


Prestige Avatars are chosen to promote and highlight the most epic characters and art in *Magic* story. Treasure Chest Avatars, on the other hand, are chosen because they made us giggle.


The first one you might open is this **Ragavan, the Monkey Avatar**.

Who doesn't love a Monkey? Kari Zev might create the token, but it goes away at end of turn. Open a Ragavan avatar, and you can have the Monkey represent you in your games forever.


The second is a **[Gishath, Sun's Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gishath%2C+Sun%27s+Avatar) Avatar**.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/mtgo/prestige-avatar_gishath.png)


It's an avatar of an Avatar. More importantly, it's a Dinosaur. Rawr.


The third and final in the initial batch is a **[Dead Man's Chest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+Man%27s+Chest) Avatar**.

Yo dawg, I heard you like treasure chests. So I put treasure chests in your Treasure Chests and even threw in a little treasure chest symbol.


When you open a Treasure Chest, you have a 1% chance to open each of these, and you'll never open two in the same Chest. When *Dominaria* is released, we'll add a fourth Treasure Chest avatar themed after a card in that set, still with a 1% chance for each. Then, when *Core 2019* releases in July, all four of them will be replaced by a single Treasure Chest Avatar from a *Core 2019* card. From then on, the plan is to have a single Treasure Chest Avatar available at a given time, themed after the latest main set release.


Treasure Chests always provide the current content, so you can't save a Treasure Chest you get, open it next year, and hope to get a Ragavan avatar. Once a Treasure Chest Avatar rotates out, it's **gone for good**\*. And you can't trade for them, so if you want one, win and open those Treasure Chests!


*\* Mostly. We won't be rereleasing these avatars in Treasure Chests or other wide distributions, but we might grant a small number of them in future promotions.*
