Six Rounds have elapsed and only 27 players out of 1297 in the room remain at the perfect record. Seeing how they have already won 6 games in a row, they are in good shape to make the Day Two cut. Just one more win out of the remaining three rounds!

Fifteen different archetypes indicate a relatively diverse field here at Sao Paulo. From the looks of it, the prowess of Esper Dragons seem greatly exaggerated. Only one has managed to crack into the Top 14 tables. We might not see as many Ojutais tomorrow as compared to Grand Prix Krakow.

However, the little red men seem to be doing rather well. Four players have stormed their way to the top with the help of Atarka's Command, two without. [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) are probably the most represented creatures thus far, confirming our suspicions of the rumored sea of green.

Just three more rounds remain, and only a handful these players will be truly undefeated! As we speak, Frank Karsten is doing a Deck Tech about a particularly interesting deck that has been cruising through the competition.
