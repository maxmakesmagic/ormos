The last round of swiss is brutal. You've been playing all weekend and the mental fatigue is starting to build up. The excitement of the run at the Top 8 has been climbing too, slowly, with each hard-fought win. Now you're one win away, one measly win when you've already notched twelve, but this is the one that matters. Focus. Play through the nerves. Win.



**The Players**




 Quebec City's Pascal Maynard has become a fixture of the Canadian magic scene, not just through his play, but also as a writer for Mana [Deprive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive)d, and as a streamer on [Twitch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twitch). With three Grand Prix Top 8s and a Worlds Team appearance under his belt, he's ready to move on to gold medals. He's on thirty-four points, so a win gives him a very good chance at the Top 8.




 Things are much more clear cut for Steve Rubin. A win locks him for Top 8. A loss and he goes home. Rubin's been a player on the rise for the past couple years, and was instrumental in the design of Ari Lax's winning deck at Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*. He tasted Top 8 glory at GP Chicago earlier this year, and he's ready for more.




**The Games**



Rubin drew his opening hand, and immediately called a judge. Shaking his head he told the judge that his opening hand contained a card from his sideboard. The judge explained that he would receive a warning, then he would fix his deck so it was in its proper game one configuration. He would then draw a new opening hand of six cards as a forced mulligan.
