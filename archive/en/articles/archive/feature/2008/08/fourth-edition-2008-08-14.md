Released in April 1995, *Fourth Edition* was a new version of the **Magic: The Gathering** basic set. In a continuing attempt to balance and add new flavor to the game, fifty-one cards were removed from the *Revised Edition* and 122 cards from previous expansions were added, bringing the total cards to 378.
