Team Modern Super League FINALS
-------------------------------


You know how we remind you every week that there's still time to catch Team Modern Super League? No longer! Tonight is the finals, the culmination of a long season of great (and weird) Modern *Magic*. This is your *actual last chance* to catch the action! Okay, not really, because you can find all the episodes on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/wizardsmtg/videos), but it *is* your last chance to watch it live.


As always, TMSL begins at 5 p.m. PT tonight (Tuesday) on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about Team Modern Super League [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/tmsl-info/).


 
Team Vintage Super League Under Way
-----------------------------------


Don't worry, even with Team Modern Super League wrapping up, we aren't leaving you bereft of Team Super Leagues to watch (what are we, monsters?). We're jumping right into Team *Vintage* Super League now. The "Conqueror" format will be the same as TMSL, with team-based deck-building rules, deck bannings, and play-till-you-lose tournament structure. The main difference, of course, is that the teams are playing Vintage, so expect insanely powerful cards and interactions every step of the way.


In fact, TVSL hit the ground running so fast, we're already one episode in! Those stealthy Vintage warriors actually got started *last* Thursday, April 19, so this Thursday will be the second episode. TVSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/format-details/).


 
*Dominaria* Is Live!
--------------------


After much anticipation, we've finally returned to *Magic*'s original plane, the site of all the epic, generation-spanning sagas of the game's early years. Now you can play with all the legendary heroes of Dominaria in Sealed and—as of yesterday—Draft Leagues on *Magic Online*. You can find *Dominaria* Leagues in the Limited Leagues section of the Play Lobby. Have fun making history!


 
Brawl Comes to *Magic Online*
-----------------------------


You might have heard some buzz lately about a new format called Brawl. (Briefly, it's best described as a mashup of Standard and Commander, and it's a ton of fun. To learn more, check out [this article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ways-play/join-brawl-2018-03-22) by Gavin Verhey.) Well, now you can play Brawl online whenever you want! Brawl Leagues can be found in the Constructed Leagues section of the Play Lobby, and especially with all the sweet new legends joining us from *Dominaria*, the format is wide open! Pick your favorite legend, build a deck that lets it shine, and jump into the Brawl.


 
Two PTQs This Weekend
---------------------


This weekend brings two Pro Tour Qualifier Finals events to *Magic Online*—notably, they are your first chances to qualify for Pro Tour Spaghetti. Saturday, April 28, the format will be Standard (now including *Dominaria*!) and will begin at 9 a.m. PT. Players can enter for 30 tickets or 300 Play Points.


Sunday, April 29, the format will be *Dominaria* Sealed Deck, and will begin at 7 a.m. PT. A red or blue PTQ Finals Entry Token is required for entry.


Each winner, as mentioned above, will qualify for Pro Tour Spaghetti.


 
*Magic Online*Format Challenges Every Weekend—Now Including Brawl
-----------------------------------------------------------------


The*Magic Online*Format Challenges continue every weekend for Modern, Vintage, 1v1 Commander, Legacy, and Pauper formats—and, in case you missed it, a brand-new offering: 1v1 Brawl! To learn more about this exciting new multiplayer format, check out Gavin Verhey's article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ways-play/join-brawl-2018-03-22).
