Now, we know how many of you will want to tune in and get a ringside view of the main event. Unfortunately, due to bandwidth restrictions, only 8500 people will be able to receive the feed at a time. If you're unable to see the live feed, don't panic! We'll have archives available in a few days so you can catch all the highlights at your leisure.
