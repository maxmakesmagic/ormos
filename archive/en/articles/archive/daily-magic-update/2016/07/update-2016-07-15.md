The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 15, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by the *Eldritch Moon* Prerelease! It's here!


Today's Must
============


1. [*Eldritch Moon* Prerelease Guide: Everything You Need to Know!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZjiaxInf30) | The Mana Source | Wedge

If you've never been to a Prerelease, or it's been a long time, this is your 13-minute guide to "one of the best events you could possibly attend." Hey, he said it.

While Aaron jumped the gun a bit on the "first ever" bit (it happened at [LoadingReadyRun's Pre-Prerelease](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGyD1qyIkIQ) the previous weekend), it was still a cool moment for Sam Stoddard, the lead developer of *Eldritch Moon*, during the Wizards of the Coast Prerelease. Expect to see a lot of pictures and tweets just like this one as people around the world start cracking packs and battling at Prereleases in stores everywhere. Follow along on [#MTGEMN](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGEMN?src=hash) for more like this. Well, not more Stoddard happy face. More Prerelease tweets.

Teams are gearing up for [Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptemn), now just a few weeks away (Aug. 5), and rosters are starting to take shape. Team East West Bowl has been one of the rising teams over the last few seasons, and with Seth Manfield headlining their roster—plus three other Platinum players, five Gold pros, and three Silver—they're definitely a team to watch in Sydney.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Ross VS. Majors: Blue-Black Zombies VS. Grixis Harmless Pact](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33294_Ross-VS-Majors-.html) | StarCityGames.com | Michael Majors and Ross Merriam

Besides the confusing use of one player's first name and the other player's last name (I assumed it was Tom Ross upon first reading), this is an awesome video showcasing two of the new decks that might be spawned by *Eldritch Moon*. Both will definitely be played at FNMs around the world—but will either make the leap? Watch to get an early look.


1. [Standardized Testing](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33293_Standardized-Testing.html) | StarCityGames.com | Emma Handy

New cards can lead to a ton of options for a new Standard—so how do you figure out what's good and what isn't? Convenient that you asked that question, disembodied voice in my head! Emma Handy talks about the "tests" cards must pass to succeed in Standard, then proposes a few decks that pass with flying colors. This is a really strong article for anyone trying to find their way in Standard.


1. [Floor, Ceiling, Bedlam Reveler](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/bedlam-reveler/) | Top Level Podcast | Mike Flores and Patrick Chapin

Flores learns what "low floor" means as the Top Level pair podcast all about [Bedlam Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bedlam+Reveler), plus some other cards. But mostly [Bedlam Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bedlam+Reveler) and its various floor and ceiling levels.


1. [Making of: Crop Sigil & Terrarion](http://project-discovery.com/blog/2016/7/14/making-of-crop-sigil-terrarion) | Project Discovery | Titus Lunter

These articles are like catnip to art fans. Here, Lunter details his process for creating two pieces from *Eldritch Moon*, complete with images of stages along the way, things he liked and didn't like about the pieces, and enough memes to fill a Buzzfeed article. Okay, well, maybe half a Buzzfeed article.


1. [Owen Turtenwald for the 2016 Hall of Fame](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/owen-turtenwald-for-the-2016-hall-of-fame/) | William Jensen | ChannelFireball

Expect to see more articles like this over the next two weeks or so, as players begin expressing their picks for the Hall of Fame. Here, Hall of Fame pro and current all-star William Jensen makes the case for his good friend and teammate Owen Turtenwald—the man who currently happens to be in second in the Player of the Year standings, has a Player of the Year trophy already, three Pro Tour Top 8s, and more Grand Prix Top 8s than just about anyone on the planet. So, it's hard sell.


Other Outlets Write About *Magic*
=================================


1. [*Eldritch Moon* review: Well damn, everything's sprouted tentacles](http://arstechnica.co.uk/gaming/2016/07/eldritch-moon-review-mtg/) | Ars Technica UK | Kyle Chapman

Ars Technica—a technology, gaming, and entertainment news outlet—reviewed *Eldritch Moon* and found it to be, well, I'll let them tell you.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [White-Blue Spirits](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13388&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=7-14-2016)

Everyone is talking about White-Blue Spirits. Or pretty darn close to everyone. The deck we'll focus on today is [the list provided by Seth Manfield](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13388&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=7-14-2016), because he's Seth Manfield and the current leader for the Player of the Year race.


In [today's article on TCGPlayer by Seth](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13388&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=7-14-2016) (which you should really read, as he provides four total deck lists), he focuses on the power of [Spell Queller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Queller) and how best to utilize it. Among the decks he lists—and he lists several—is a full-on Spirits tribal list that looks like it could be one of the defining decks of the format. It gets to use cheap flying creatures, a smattering of counterspells, and a number of instant-speed tricks to keep opponents off balance.


This is Spirits pushed as far as it will go, Manfield points out, without cards like [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) and the like. Expect to see something like this at FNM and on the Pro Tour in the coming weeks.
