 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 







 A couple of weeks ago, at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*, we started doing something incredibly cool with the feature match area. We reserved one of the four matches on the big stage for the player sitting at the top of the standings, ensuring that the player that was leading the tournament would always have a seat under the lights. Upon seeing how well it worked at the Pro Tour, I was eager to see how it would transition to the Grand Prix level, and Buenos Aires gave me my first crack at it.



At the Pro Tour, we were calling this Feature Match the King of the Hill feature match. Now, "King of the Hill" doesn't exactly translate perfectly into Spanish. Here in Buenos Aires, there is no "King of the Hill." There is instead El Goleador del Torneo, which those of you that are fans of soccer (which is what us stupid Americans call football), you might recognize it as the Spanish term for the top scorer on a team. It's also generally used to describe the best player. I wasn't the one that chose it, but it sounds like a fairly good approximation of the idea to me.


Enter our Goleador.


Beginning with Fernando Calvo in Round 4, the player that sits atop the standings will be featured in the Feature Match area at a specially designated table. From that point, it is up to them whether or not they get to stay there, or whether they return to the pool of players vying for the spot. It's possible that one player could make multiple appearances at the table, as Michael Hetrick did in Valencia. It's possible that each round will feature a new Goleador. All that is certain is that the only way to stay atop the standings, thus keep the coveted position, is to keep winning. So far, Calvo has proven up to the task, but competition for the top spot, which will eventually guarantee admission into the Top 8, is fierce, and the fates are fickle. One bad matchup or bad round and he will be El Goleador no more.
