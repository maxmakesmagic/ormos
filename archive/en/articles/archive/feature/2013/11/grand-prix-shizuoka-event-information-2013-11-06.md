Easily accessible by land, sea, and air, Shizuoka is located in Japan's approximate geographical center and faces the Pacific Ocean. Lying halfway between Tōkyō and Ōsaka, it has prospered for long as the meeting point of east and west, both cultural and economical. It is a little over one hour from Tōkyō and about two hours from Ōsaka by Shinkansen.


The temperate climate here is said to be reflected in the people of this prefecture, who are known for their mild and open manner. The scenery of Shizuoka includes the Southern Japan Alps and about five hundred kilometers of coastline. Four distinct seasons and lack of harsh weather have been said to be major factors in the region's long-standing prosperity; today that prosperity continues as industry and advanced technologies in the region stand as pillars of Japan's industrial success and economic prominence. Traditional folk crafts produced today as they have been for hundreds of years are the pride of the prefecture. Verdant tea plantations and abundant groves of mandarin oranges give Shizuoka its name, which translates as "Tranquil Hills."


Since the Fuji volcanic belt, embracing such volcanoes as Mt. Fuji (the highest mountain in Japan, and easily Japan's most recognized landmark), Mt. Ashitaka, and Mt. Togasa, extends to the Izu Peninsula, Shizuoka has affluent hot springs at Atami, Itō, Shūzen-ji and many other places, which makes the prefecture one of major sightseeing and relaxation spots in the country.

Forms can be [downloaded here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/Consent_form_2013_Magic.pdf) and will be available onsite. Minors must have a parent or guardian’s signature on these forms. Minors will not be able to register or play unless we receive a waiver signed by a parent or guardian. No exceptions. 



**Tournament Format**
  


* [Standard Constructed](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrstandard)
* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day Two that they used on Day One.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of a maximum of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 6 Swiss rounds and the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 matches will have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).


**Judges**
  
 The head judge for Grand Prix Shizuoka will be Kevin Desprez (Level 4, France). Judge applications for this event are closed.

* In the event that a player who wins an invitation to a Pro Tour stop at a Grand Prix has already qualified for an invitation, the invitation does not pass down under any circumstances. Previous qualification may be through a Qualifier tournament, through performance at a professional tournament, or by being an invited DCI player (valid upon the date of the official rank announcement for the appropriate professional tournament).

**[Willian Murai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=%5B%22willian%20murai%22%5D)**



Willian Murai, a.k.a Will Murai, was born in a small town in southeastern Brazil. The son of Japanese immigrants, has been a fan of anime, manga, and comic books since he was little kid. Inspired by the classic and contemporary artists in the industry, early on he knew that drawing is what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.


While studying graphic design in college, he had the opportunity to work as a comic book colorist for American publishers, which earned him experience both in a professional and artistic aspect. After that, he decided to become an illustrator and, since then, he has been working in fields such as publishing, advertising, and internet, having recently dedicated special attention to game development and fantasy art.


 His debut on **Magic: The Gathering** was in the *Return to Ravnica* block which he considers a great milestone in his career. Being a fan of **Magic** in the 1990s, he feels privileged to be able to reconnect to it not only as a fan, but also as an artist contributing to the history of the game. He proudly uses [Frontline Medic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frontline+Medic) in his Boros deck.
