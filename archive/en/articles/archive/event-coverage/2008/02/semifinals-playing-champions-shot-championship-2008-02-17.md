**Game 1**


Both players jockeyed for the early lead with a couple of quick creatures. Xu had a [Tideshaper Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tideshaper+Mystic) on the first turn, while Pascoli had a [Fire-Belly Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire-Belly+Changeling) and [Seething Pathblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Pathblazer) on consecutive turns. Xu dropped the first bomb of the game with a turn three [Drowner of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Secrets). Pascoli had a quick return salvo himself as [Eyeblight's Ending](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending) ended the Drowner before more than a single card could be milled. He also chose to [Tarfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarfire) the Mystic out of the way, clearing the ground for his two creatures.


Xu started rebuilding with a [Streambed Aquitects](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Streambed+Aquitects) and [Stonybrook Schoolmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonybrook+Schoolmaster). Pascoli was recruiting for his army as well, and [War-Spike Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War-Spike+Changeling) answered the call. By this point he had blown most of his load and, while sporting a nice little army, had only one card left in his hand. Xu dropped a [Stonybrook Schoolmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonybrook+Schoolmaster) into the war zone, I'm sure wishing he still had the Drowner around to give him a reason to turn sideways.


The [Changeling Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Berserker) Pascoli played on the next turn didn't need a reason other than his five power to turn sideways. He came down, pushed the [Fire-Belly Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire-Belly+Changeling) to the side, and dragged the [Seething Pathblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Pathblazer) along for the ride. Xu decided to toss his Aquitects in front of the Pathblazer, the Elemental took offense and ate the [War-Spike Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War-Spike+Changeling) to take the Aquitects down.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkl08/sf2_xu.jpg)Xu took advantage of the clear lane to send his [Stonybrook Schoolmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonybrook+Schoolmaster) at Pascoli. He followed that up with an [Ethereal Whiskergill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Whiskergill) that was large enough to eat any of Pascoli's men. Pascoli really needed the lane clear and used a [Lash Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+Out) to take the big flier down. He then sent his team across the table, which forced Xu to chump block the Berserker with his Merfolk token. This left the Schoolmaster as his lone creature and put him down to a mere six life.


Xu attacked with his Schoolmaster to grab himself another token and then played an [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) returning the [Seething Pathblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Pathblazer) to Pascoli's hand. Pascoli sent his Berserker in for more beats on the following turn, and Xu's [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) stepped in front and took one for the team. Pascoli just replayed his Pathblazer and followed it up with a [Release the Ants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Release+the+Ants) to kill Xu's token, again leaving him with solely a Schoolmaster.


Xu tapped out on his next turn to play the rarely seen [Knowledge Exploitation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knowledge+Exploitation). After thumbing through Pascoli's deck, Xu snapped up a [Violet Pall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violet+Pall) to kill the [Seething Pathblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Pathblazer), but Pascoli was smart enough to sacrifice the Elemental Shaman to its own activated ability, denying Xu the Faerie token. Pascoli didn't have a play on his next turn, and he was left very little in the way of offense. It was just his [Fire-Belly Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire-Belly+Changeling) against Xu's [Stonybrook Schoolmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonybrook+Schoolmaster). With Xu at six Pascoli couldn't kill him and decided to just pass the turn back to Xu.


Xu smashed in with his Schoolmaster, nothing too special there, but he raised an eyebrow when Pascoli blocked with his [Fire-Belly Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire-Belly+Changeling). Pascoli pumped the Changeling enough to trade with the Schoolmaster, but with damage on the stack, he reinforced the Changeling with a [Brighthearth Banneret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brighthearth+Banneret). That left nothing in play except a lone Merfolk token for Xu, and a [Fire-Belly Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire-Belly+Changeling) with an important two toughness for Pascoli. Xu had no other play, and sent the game back over to Pascoli.


Pascoli attacked in with his Fire-Belly, and Xu declined to block. Pascoli pumped his Changeling twice, knocking Xu to two. Xu had nothing on the following turn, and sent the turn back to Pascoli with many lands open, and a few cards in hand. Pascoli wasn't about to chance losing the game to a [Neck Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neck+Snap) or [Coordinated Barrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coordinated+Barrage), especially since he had no replacement for his Changeling if it died. So, instead of attacking, he just passed the turn content to wait on a burn spell.


A [Paperfin Rascal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paperfin+Rascal) from Xu showed a [Coordinated Barrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coordinated+Barrage) on top of his deck, and allowed Pascoli to put a Swamp on the bottom of his deck. Xu was almost completely stabilized now. Unfortunately, board stability means nothing when your opponent draws and plays a [Shard Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Volley) to finish you off, which is exactly what Pascoli did to take the first game.


Pascoli 1, Xu 0


**Game 2**


Pascoli managed to deal enough early damage the last game that he could scrape his way to enough damage to put the game away. Even with the barrage of early damage and removal spells, Xu was almost able to stabilize and turn the game around.


This game, his [Amoeboid Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amoeboid+Changeling) was slightly trumped by Pascoli's turn two [Festercreep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festercreep). [Festercreep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festercreep) can be huge against Merfolk decks since they tend toward a swarm of one-toughness creatures. Unfazed, Xu dropped another turn three [Drowner of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Secrets) which, with a little support, could make short work of Pascoli's deck since it came down so early. All Pascoli could do was play a [Sunflare Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunflare+Shaman) on his next turn and let Xu start the milling.


Sadly for Xu, it was going to be hard to add more reinforcements since he was unable to draw a fourth land. Not only that, but all of his lands were Islands. Fortunately, his [Paperfin Rascal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paperfin+Rascal) revealed that help was on the way in the form of another Island. However, it was slow coming, especially in the face of Pascoli's [Changeling Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Berserker). You only have so many five-point chunks of life.


Xu's fourth Island, while not allowing him access to his white cards, did allow him to drop a huge blocker in the form of [Ethereal Whiskergill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Whiskergill). By this point, all of Xu's milling was playing into Pascoli's [Sunflare Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunflare+Shaman), and he casually picked up his graveyard to count the Elementals. He decided to aim a [Shard Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Volley) at the Whiskergill at the cost of a Swamp. This let him send his [Changeling Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Berserker) in for a beating. Xu couldn't really block thanks to the [Sunflare Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunflare+Shaman), so he let the Changeling drop him to ten.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkl08/sf2_pascoli_xu.jpg)The next turn sent three more cards into Pascoli's graveyard. Xu sped through his next turn as it passed without a Plains. He finally managed to use a [Disperse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disperse) to deal with the Berserker during the next attack, and [Broken Ambitions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Ambitions) killed it for good. Pascoli left the [Fire-Belly Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire-Belly+Changeling) on top rather than risk losing a better card to the Drowner's hit crew, as well as feeding his [Sunflare Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunflare+Shaman). A second [Sunflare Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunflare+Shaman) hit play, which might actually end up being the death of Xu since, with five Elementals in play, Pascoli could just aim both of his Shamen at Xu's head to do the last ten points of damage.


Xu finally drew his Plains, but he was in a tight spot staring down at those two Shamans. He declined to do anything on his turn, though, and just played the Plains and passed the turn to Pascoli. Pascoli threw the first of the Elemental firecrackers at Xu's head before untapping and throwing the second. Xu had nothing he could do about the second activation and packed his cards up.


Pascoli 2, Xu 0


**Game 3**


Pascoli's first play of the third game was last game's all-star—[Sunflare Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunflare+Shaman). Unsurprisingly, Xu had a [Drowner of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Secrets) for the third game in a row, and, as we learned last game, that could lead to some very interesting things down the road. When Pascoli sent his Shaman in to attack on the following turn, Xu hesitated before blocking, perhaps fearing the [Brighthearth Banneret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brighthearth+Banneret) he saw the previous two games. Instead of the Banneret, though, Pascoli had a [Peppersmoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peppersmoke) in hand to shrink the Drowner to a manageable level.


[Festercreep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festercreep) made another appearance for Pascoli, perhaps serving as Berserker Changeling fodder on a future turn. Xu made a [Paperfin Rascal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paperfin+Rascal) on the following turn, which revealed an [Eyeblight's Ending](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending) on top of Pascoli's deck. Pascoli didn't want to wait on his [Sunflare Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunflare+Shaman) to become useful, and just sent him into attack. The Rascal traded with him, which I'm sure both players were content with, especially since Pascoli just replaced it with a [War-Spike Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War-Spike+Changeling).


Xu had an [Ethereal Whiskergill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Whiskergill) on the following turn. Whiskergill thus far has been nothing more than a removal magnet for Xu, but this time Pascoli didn't need to kill it immediately since it couldn't block the War-Spike without dying. It couldn't, but the [Neck Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neck+Snap) Xu had waiting for it could, and the Changeling went down hard.


Xu had another Drowner of secrets on the following turn, which he played right into Pascoli's [Eyeblight's Ending](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending). When Pascoli tried to end the Drowner, though, Xu calmly [Disperse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disperse)d it back to his hand. All Pascoli did on the following turn was draw his card and pass the turn with a huge number of lands open. He only had two cards in hand, and it appeared that he may be running out of steam. Xu added a [Streambed Aquitects](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Streambed+Aquitects) to his team, which would give his Whiskergill a way to finally get over and attack Pascoli. Since Xu was still at 16 and all Pascoli had was a [Festercreep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festercreep), the race was well in his favor. He made it even more so after combat by championing the Whiskergill with a [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkl08/sf2_pascoli1.jpg)Pascoli played a [Sunflare Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunflare+Shaman) that could eventually be a problem, but for now its potential damage was too small to kill the Hero. When Xu played an [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) on the following turn it seemed that he would put the game away in short order. All Pascoli could do was replay the Shaman and play a Pathblazer.


Xu went on the offensive, sending his [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero) at Pascoli and knocking him to eight. It also put him up to 24 so there would be very little chance for any Sunflare shenanigans like last game. When Xu sent his [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero) in on the following turn Pascoli chump blocked with his [Sunflare Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunflare+Shaman) and then tossed the Shaman at Xu's Aquitects. That prevented Xu from gaining any more life, as well as getting rid of the pesky creature-pumper. He tried to add some fat of his own to his team, but Xu was ready for his [Axegrinder Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Axegrinder+Giant) with a [Sage's Dousing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage%27s+Dousing).


Xu kept sending his [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero) in to attack, but this time Pascoli was able to get rid of it by blocking with his Pathblazer and sacrificing his [Festercreep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festercreep) to give it first strike. However, he was down to a lonely Pathblazer and facing a giant army with no gas left in his tank. He peeked at his next card and packed the game in.


Xu 1, Pascoli 2


**Game 4**


Xu got on the board quite quickly with a turn two [Deeptread Merrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deeptread+Merrow). Pascoli started the game off quite laboriously and didn't get to play a creature until turn 5, which let the roguish Merfolk get in for a hefty chunk of damage. The toll looked like it would continue to rise, too, when Pascoli's attempted [Thundercloud Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundercloud+Shaman) got hit with a [Sage's Dousing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage%27s+Dousing).


Pascoli wasn't too deterred though, and used [Makeshift Mannequin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mannequin) to bring the [Thundercloud Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundercloud+Shaman) back, killing Xu's Merrow. The following turn Xu paid the full amount to play a [Latchkey Faerie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Latchkey+Faerie) which combined with a [Cloak and Dagger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloak+and+Dagger) he had played earlier to make a pesky five-powered clock.


Pascoli was set with a clock of his own, though, and played an [Inner-Flame Acolyte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner-Flame+Acolyte) pumping itself, and sent his two creatures across to smack Xu for eight. Xu wasn't having any of that though, and his [Disperse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disperse) proved lethal to Pascoli's makeshift [Thundercloud Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundercloud+Shaman). The Acolyte still got in for four, and then Pascoli passed the turn.


Xu had another [Drowner of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Secrets), which served the dual purpose of providing an alternate kill condition in case Pascoli found a way to kill his Faerie and, more importantly, providing a little wall that the Acolyte couldn't attack through. The [Latchkey Faerie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Latchkey+Faerie) turned sideways a few more times and there was nothing Pascoli could do to stop it as his life total dwindled away to nothing.


Xu 2, Pascoli 2 


**Game 5**


Time for the rubber game, boys! Pascoli got a much faster start for the final game, and his turn two Sunflare Acolyte was able to get in for a quick couple of beats. Xu didn't have the third-turn [Drowner of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Secrets) this game. In fact, he didn't have anything until he played a [Stonybrook Schoolmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonybrook+Schoolmaster) the following turn. By this point the Shaman had eaten four of his life and had even managed to pick up a [Blind-Spot Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind-Spot+Giant) buddy along the way.


Pascoli didn't have another Giant to go with it on turn five, but he did have something better—[Chandra Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Nalaar). The fiery red-head immediately sautéed the Schoolmaster to a crisp. Xu evoked an [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) on the following turn to bounce Chandra. He left two mana open, signaling that he had the [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) to deal with her permanently. Rather than indulge him, though, Pascoli simply played a [War-Spike Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War-Spike+Changeling), allowing his [Blind-Spot Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind-Spot+Giant) to attack, and dropping Xu to eight. Xu was forced to [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) a [Lash Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+Out) on his lone blocker the following turn, which let Pascoli get his Chandra back into play. Xu had nothing he could do at this point and conceded the match.


Pascoli 3 – Xu 2
