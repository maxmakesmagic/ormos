GRAND PRIX YOKOHAMA 2004
------------------------


Rochester Champ Repeat
======================




November 19-21












[日本語の取材へ](/en/node/573481)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpyoko04/champ.jpg)Well it took eleven hours of play and drafting on Day 2, but we finally know that the latest Grand Prix--Yokohama champion is none other than Kazuki Katou, the player that won last year's Japanese Rochester Grand Prix. Katou obliterated his opponents in the final draft with a red/black deck that featured the perfect mix of beatdown and disruption. Even when his opponents were getting perfect starts, Katou's bears smashed right past them as his Kamis of Fire's [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar) and [Unearthly Blizzard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unearthly+Blizzard)s made the opponent's creatures irrelevant. After easily dispatching Masahiko Morita's blue-red deck in the quarters, Katou did drop a game to Akira Asahara's blue-white deck in the semifinals, but the other two games in that match were a washout, as Katou quickly found himself in the finals, waiting for an opponent.


On the other side of the bracket, Tomohiro Kaji defeated Rei Hashimoto in the quarters with some help from a few mistakes on the part of his opponent. He then faced a thriller of a match in the semifinals against Koutarou Ootsuke that ended with Kaji casting [Lure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) on one of his creatures and swinging for the full twenty in one shot. Unfortunately for him, that was where his winning streak stopped, as Katou swept him aside in two lightning fast games in the finals, earning his second Grand Prix title in as many years. Congratulations to Kazuki Katou, the 2004 Grand Prix Yokohama Champion!

Saturday, November 20: 1:18 pm - Deck Tech with Player Type - Legendary
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Champions of Kamigawa sealed deck is different from anything that we've seen with recent sets, as players are forced to balance tribal concerns, splice/arcane spells, color considerations, mana curve, and overall deck power in order to find the strongest possible combination of cards. We decided to sit down with three of the Legends of Japanese Magic and see what they have done with their card pools.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpyoko04/blog1.jpg)*Tsuyoshi Fujita*
**Tsuyoshi Fujita**  



For starters, when looking through Tsuyoshi's sideboard, I noticed a lonely [Glacial Ray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) hanging out, a card that nearly every player will easily splash for. Tsuyoshi explained that his mana requirements basically prohibited a splash. If you look at his card pool, he has a series of double black spells that he needs to cast in the early and middle game like the two different Oni and [Wicked Akuba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba), and then has the triple green required to play [Jugan, the Rising Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jugan%2C+the+Rising+Star), leaving him in no position to run [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s and still be able to cast his spells consistently.


I was also a bit curious when I looked at his pool and saw [Distress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress) in the maindeck. Fujita explained that he feels hand destruction is strong in this format (he also has a [Waking Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare) in the main), so he's running [Distress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress). "You need instants to break through stalemates, and I don't really have many in my deck. [Distress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress) knocks those out of your opponent's hand, however, and gives you an information advantage. Plus it also takes care of the instant enchantments (instantments) before they can be used as a combat trick."


He has two in-color 2/1s sitting in his sideboard in [Orochi Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orochi+Ranger) and [Cruel Deceiver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Deceiver). When I asked him about these, Fujita explained that both cards are stopped by Zuberas, and while they are solid draft creatures, he doesn't particularly like to play them in sealed. A sixth-turn 2/1 is not a great play to make in this format.


**Prediction:** He only 2 Byes in this tournament, so he said 6-2 seemed like a pretty good prediction, and if his tiebreakers are good, he will maybe make Day 2.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpyoko04/blog3.jpg)*Masashi Oiso's cards*
**Masashi Oiso**  



Looking at Oiso's pool, it appeared very powerful. He has two [Glacial Ray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray), a [Blind with Anger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+with+Anger), Konda, [Hanabi Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanabi+Blast), [Cage of Hands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cage+of+Hands), [Mothrider Samurai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mothrider+Samurai), and some solid tricks like [Indomitable Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indomitable+Will) and [Blessed Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Breath). However, he has a gaping hole for creatures in what is perhaps the most important spot in the current Sealed deck format - the three-slot. Most red/white decks would have at least one of [Ronin Houndmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ronin+Houndmaster), [Kabuto Moth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabuto+Moth), or [Kitsune Blademaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitsune+Blademaster) just chilling, waiting to be cast on turn 3, but Oiso isn't so lucky.


It's not as if red and white were Oiso's only possibilities either, as he had enough black cards to make him consider running a splash, perhaps for [Scuttling Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scuttling+Death) and [Thief of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), but in the end he chose consistency over a splash in his maindeck, though he said he might run some of the black cards out of the sideboard. It's not like his deck is lacking in strong removal spells, but it will be interesting to see if his lack of three-drops puts him behind the gun, making it tough to recover the tempo advantage his deck inherently gives to his opponents.


Since he has two [Glacial Ray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray)s, I pondered the idea that [Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike) might not be bad, but Oiso said that he hates cards that only target players, particularly in sealed deck, and while it might be decent, he wasn't going to run it as a matter of personal preference.


**Prediction:** When I asked if he would Day 2, Oiso just laughed and shook his head, not so much lacking in confidence as not wanting to jinx himself before beginning play on the day.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpyoko04/blog2.jpg)*Masahiro Kuroda*
**Masahiro Kuroda**  



When I sat down with him, he immediately told me that he misbuilt his deck, as he was getting color-screwed far too many times in testing. When he was initially building his deck, he figured that splashing three green cards in order to take advantage of [Kodama's Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Might), [Strength of Cedars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+of+Cedars), and [Moss Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moss+Kami) was a good plan, but now that he's played with the deck for a while, he believes it would have been better to go with a more consistent build by running two [Ashen-Skin Zubera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen-Skin+Zubera) and a Yamabushi's Storm.


The rest of his pool looks quite solid, though he's a little short on spirits for his [Devouring Greed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Greed), as only nine of his fourteen creatures meet that criteria. The creatures that he does have are solid, and are complemented by a [Yamabushi's Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yamabushi%27s+Flame) and a [Glacial Ray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray), plus the green pump spells I mentioned before.


**Prediction**: "Well, I have 3 Byes, so 6-2 is not out of the question. My deck isn't all that good, but 3-2 on the day plus some good tiebreakers may mean I get to play tomorrow."


We'll try and catch up with these players again at the end of the day to see how their predictions panned out, and to give you their deckists.
