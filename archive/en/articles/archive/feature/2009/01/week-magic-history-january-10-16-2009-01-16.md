[![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/magic_expansion_visions_expansionLogo_en.jpg)](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_visions_productinfo)On January 11, 1997, the world got its first glimpse of *Visions* and **Magic** would never be the same. The introduction of "187" creatures like [Man-o'-War](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Man-o%27-War), [Uktabi Orangutan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Orangutan), and [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal) allowed players to get both a creature and the effect of a spell with a single card.

*Visions* was the first small set to be designed to work with the large set immediately before it (*Ice Age* and *Alliances* also worked together, but *Homelands* was released between them) and *Mirage* block was the first of the three-set blocks, which defined **Magic's** expansions until the four-set *Lorwyn-Shadowmoor* Block.
