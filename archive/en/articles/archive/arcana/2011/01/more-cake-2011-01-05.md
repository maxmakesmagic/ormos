If you were here during the winter break, you probably saw [this Arcana](/en/articles/archive/delicious-cake-2010-12-22), which featured a cake in the shape of a **Magic** Starter Deck.

We'd show you that cake again, but since it was here just a couple of weeks ago (and originally appeared back in April), it would seem kind of redundant. Instead, how about an entirely new **Magic** cake?

There are two things you should know about this cake. First, unlike the previous cake, it was made by an amateur. Sarah Isbell really likes **Magic**, and her mother wanted to give her a cake that reflects that. And she did a great job!

The second thing you should know is the secret danger of cool cakes: Sarah took the cake to her local store's Friday Night Magic, but no one wanted to cut it. This is obviously crazy. People! It's not a real **Magic** card! There's cake under there!
