**Updates to Event Pairing Algorithm**


Today, we are updating how pairing in events works. This change should reduce the number of users who are paired incorrectly according to tournament rules. We will be monitoring this transition closely, both internally and via player reports. If you encounter any issues with who you're paired against in an event, please let us know via the link below.
