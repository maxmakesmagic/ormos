[![Magic Pro Tour Hall of Fame](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/magazine/events/halloffame/halloffame.jpg)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgevent/hof/welcome)


The **Magic: The Gathering**  Pro Tour Hall of Fame will enshrine the most significant and influential competitors of the game. It will consist of an online museum dedicated to the Hall of Fame members, as well as the Pro Tour Hall of Fame Exhibit, which will be on display at selected events. Players will be voted into the Pro Tour Hall of Fame on an annual basis by select committees (as set out below).


 


### Eligibility


In order to have his or her name on the 2013 Hall of Fame selection ballot, a player must meet BOTH of the following two requirements:


* 1. The player must have participated in his first Magic: the Gathering Pro Tour at least 10 seasons prior to the current voting year.  

 2. The player must be in good standing with the DCI (e.g, not suspended or under investigation).
  
  
  

Additionally, the player must meet ONE of the following four requirements:


* 1. The player must have 150 lifetime Professional Points as of May 19, 2013; or  

 2. The player must have appeared on a Pro Tour Hall of Fame ballot from 2005 to 2012 and (1) not had his or her name removed from the ballot prior to 2013, or (2) not had his or her name scheduled to be removed from the ballot in 2013; or  

 3. The player must have (1) first appeared in a Pro Tour prior to August 11, 2003, (2) crossed 100 Lifetime Professional Points threshold between May 14, 2012 and May 19, 2013, and (3) have between 100 and 149 Lifetime Professional Points as of May 19, 2013; or  

 4. The player must have (1) played in his or her first Pro Tour between August 11, 2003 and September 5, 2004 and (2) have between 100 and 149 Lifetime Professional Points as of May 19, 2013.
  
  

Criterions 2 through 4 will only be used for 2013. Starting in 2014, a player must have 150 lifetime Professional Points to appear on the Hall of Fame ballot, regardless of any previous years’ criteria or personal performance.


### Removal from the Ballot


If a player receives votes on less than 10% of the returned, un-weighted ballots for three consecutive years of voting, that player shall be removed from the Hall of Fame selection ballot until they re-qualify pursuant to the process below.


A player may be added back to the Hall of Fame selection ballot if that player receives 4 Professional Points during the period from May 14, 2012 to May 19, 2013. Future ballots will examine a similar span of time for return to the ballot.


### Selection


Selection of players for the Pro Tour Hall of Fame will be conducted via the Hall of Fame vote. The Hall of Fame vote will be comprised of votes from two committees: The Selection Committee and the Players Committee. Voting for both committees will be conducted simultaneously.


Each member of the Selection Committee and the Players Committee will receive a ballot of eligible players based on the criteria set forth above. From that ballot, each member will select a maximum of 5 players.


Votes from the Selection Committee will comprise 67% of the total vote. Votes from the Players Committee will comprise 33% of the total vote.


Players who appear on at least 40% of the weighted ballots will become members of the Pro Tour Hall of Fame. In the event that no player appears on at least 40% of the weighted ballots, the player receiving the most votes will become a member-elect of the Pro Tour Hall of Fame. Newly elected members officially become members of the Pro Tour Hall of Fame at the induction ceremony held at Pro Tour *Theros* in Dublin.


### Selection Criteria


When voting, members of both committees use the following as the basis for their selections:


* Player's performances,
* Playing ability,
* Integrity,
* Sportsmanship, and
* Contributions to the game in general

### Committee Memberships


The Pro Tour Hall of Fame Selection Committee is made up of approximately 145 members. Members are hand-picked by Wizards of the Coast on an annual basis and consist of:


* Luminaries of the history of **Magic**
* Longtime reporters and commentators of the Pro Tour
* High-level judges, scorekeepers, and similar tournament officials
* Certain administrative officials from the DCI, who have been responsible for the establishment of policy directly pertaining to the Pro Tour
* Key Wizards employees with first-hand experience playing on the Pro Tour
* Members of the **Magic: The Gathering** Pro Tour Hall of Fame
* Other selected individuals associated Wizards of the Coast who have had occasion to directly observe and influence the Pro Tour

The Player Committee is composed of players with at least 100 lifetime Professional Points (as of May 19, 2013). If a player with at least 100 lifetime Professional Points is on the Selection Committee, he will not be able to vote as part of the Player Committee.


Currently suspended DCI Members are not eligible for membership in the Selection Committee or the Players Committee.


The members of both committees will be made public. While the results of the voting will be made public, the votes of individual members of the committee will not be made public by Wizards of the Coast. Committee members may choose (and are encouraged) to make their votes public.


The following rules apply to members of both committees:


* Players who appear on the ballot and are also committee members are not permitted to vote for themselves. Members are permitted to abstain from voting for the maximum number of players.
* Committee members are required to avoid politics, unseemly behavior, or any other action that could harm the integrity of the voting process, as determined by Wizards of the Coast in its sole discretion. When in doubt, think of your ballot as if it were the only one that counted.
* Committee members are forbidden from selling or trading their votes.

### Benefits


Members of the Hall of Fame will receive the following benefits:


* Each Hall of Fame member will be enshrined in the Pro Tour Hall of Fame Exhibit and the Pro Tour Hall of Fame portion of the wizards.com website.
* In 2013, newly inducted Hall of Fame members will receive the official Pro Tour Hall of Fame ring.
* In 2013, Hall of Fame members-elect will receive airfare and hotel accommodation[\*](#accomodation) to participate in Pro Tour *Theros*  in Dublin and attend the Pro Tour Hall of Fame induction ceremony.
