The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [**Wizards.com/CustomerService**](http://www.wizards.com/CustomerService).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed. Notably, none of the cards that have been released in previous *Magic* products are listed.

GENERAL NOTES
=============


**Release Information**


The *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* set contains 221 cards (90 common, 67 uncommon, 50 rare, and 14 mythic rare).


There are 80 cards within the *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* set that are completely new to the *Magic* game. Of these, twelve have the card type conspiracy (see "Returning Card Type: Conspiracy" below), and these aren't legal in any sanctioned Constructed format. The other 68 new cards are legal for play in the Vintage and Legacy formats as of the official release date, August 26, 2016. They aren't legal for play in the Standard or Modern formats.


Each other card in this release is legal for play in any format that already allowed that card. That is, appearing in this product doesn't change a card's legality in any format.

Pssst...Hey You! Yeah, You!
===========================


The next few sections introduce the uninitiated to the wonders of *Conspiracy* Draft. If you've conspired before and are more interested in what the new set has to offer, feel free to skip ahead to the section entitled "The Monarch." Read that section carefully—it might be your head that wears the crown.


***Conspiracy*** **Draft**


*Conspiracy* Draft is a casual variant in which players participate in a booster draft, typically using *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* and/or *Magic: The Gathering*—*Conspiracy* booster packs, but possibly involving other sets as well. After building decks, they then play in one or more free-for-all multiplayer games. Conspiracies, intrigue, and secrecy add to the excitement and keep your opponents unsteady at every turn.


*Conspiracy* Draft works best as an eight-player draft that then breaks into two separate four-player games, but it can be enjoyed with any number of players. It's recommended that drafts have no more than ten players at a single table and individual games have no more than five players. If a draft breaks into multiple games, randomly determine who will play in which game after the draft but before deck building begins. For each individual game, where each player sits should also be chosen at random; it doesn't matter where anyone sat during the draft.




---

**Multiplayer Games**


The main difference between a one-on-one game and a multiplayer game is that you have more opponents to defeat on your way to victory. Over the course of the game, you may make temporary truces, deals, and alliances—politics matter! But ultimately, you're on your own. The other players are always your opponents, even if you've temporarily made peace with them.


* Each player starts at 20 life.
* The first time a player takes a mulligan, he or she draws seven cards rather than six. Subsequent hands decrease by one card as normal. If a player keeps an opening hand with six or fewer cards, that player may effectively scry 1 before the first turn begins.
* Each turn is taken individually and includes all the normal steps and phases. Notably, the player who goes first does not skip his or her first turn's draw step.
* During combat, you may attack any of your opponents and/or any planeswalkers they control. You may even attack multiple opponents and/or planeswalkers.
* If there are multiple defending players, they declare blockers in turn order. Each player's creatures may block only the creatures attacking that player or a planeswalker controlled by that player.
* Play proceeds clockwise. That is, after your turn, the player on your left takes his or her turn.
* Your spells and abilities can affect any player, permanent, spell, or card in the game, no matter how far away from you they are.
* You win the game when each other player has been eliminated.

**Leaving the Game**


* A player leaves the game when he or she loses the game.
* All permanents, spells, and other cards the player owns leave the game. Any effects that gave that player control of anything end.
* If the player controlled any copies of spells or abilities on the stack, those copies cease to exist. They won't resolve.
* If the player still controls any objects, those objects are exiled.
* Nothing can happen to a player who has left the game. For example, combat damage can't be dealt to that player, and delayed triggered abilities controlled by that player won't be put on the stack.
* If a player who has left the game is required to make a choice, the controller of the spell or ability chooses another player (or opponent, if appropriate) to make that choice.
* If a player leaves the game during his or her turn, that turn continues, even though there isn't an active player. The next player in turn order receives priority whenever the active player would.

**The Monarch**


What are we all conspiring for? Fiora's ultimate prize: the throne of Paliano. The monarch is a new designation a player may earn during the game, enjoying certain bonuses...at least until that player is deposed.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/azetllnwjpxztp2b_CN2/en_vShfiBPd0s.png)


Custodi Lich  

3BB  

Creature — Zombie Cleric  

4/2  

When Custodi Lich enters the battlefield, you become the monarch.  

Whenever you become the monarch, target player sacrifices a creature.


The official rules for the monarch are as follows:


716. The Monarch  

716.1. The monarch is a designation a player can have. Some cards instruct a player to become the monarch.  

716.2. There are two inherent triggered abilities associated with being the monarch. These triggered abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who was the monarch at the time the abilities triggered. This is an exception to rule 112.8. The full texts of these abilities are "At the beginning of the monarch's end step, that player draws a card" and "Whenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch."  

716.3. Only one player can be the monarch at a time. As a player becomes the monarch, the current monarch ceases being the monarch.  

716.4. If the monarch leaves the game, the active player becomes the monarch. If the leaving monarch is the active player, the next player in turn order becomes the monarch.


* The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward.
* Abilities that trigger whenever you "become the monarch" trigger only if you aren't already the monarch. For example, if you are already the monarch as Custodi Lich enters the battlefield, its last ability won't trigger.
* If the triggered ability that causes the monarch to draw a card goes on the stack, and a different player becomes the monarch before that ability resolves, the first player will still draw the card.

**Goad**


Enemies that refuse to enter the fray can be infuriating. Goad is a new keyword action that can force opposing creatures to attack.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/azetllnwjpxztp2b_CN2/en_CJKlnEwKm5.png)


Coveted Peacock  

3UU  

Creature — Bird  

3/4  

Flying


Whenever Coveted Peacock attacks, you may goad target creature defending player controls. *(Until your next turn, that creature attacks each combat if able and attacks a player other than you if able.)*


The official rules for goad are as follows:


701.35. Goad  

701.35a Certain spells and abilities can goad a creature. Until the next turn of the controller of such a spell or ability, that creature attacks each combat if able and attacks a player other than the controller of that spell or ability if able.


* If, during a player's declare attackers step, a creature that player controls that's been goaded is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under that player's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack a player, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
* If the creature doesn't meet any of the above exceptions and can attack, it must attack a player other than the controller of the spell or ability that goaded it if able. If the creature can't attack any of those players but could otherwise attack, it must attack an opposing planeswalker (controlled by any opponent) or the player who goaded it.
* Being goaded isn't an ability the creature has. Once it's been goaded, it must attack as detailed above even if it loses all abilities.
* Attacking with a goaded creature doesn't cause it to stop being goaded. If there is an additional combat phase that turn, or if another player gains control of it before it stops being goaded, it must attack again if able.
* If a creature you control has been goaded by multiple opponents, it must attack one of your opponents who hasn't goaded it, as that fulfills the maximum number of goad requirements. If a creature you control has been goaded by each of your opponents, you choose which opponent it attacks. Poor thing.



---

**Melee**


Successful strategy on Fiora often boils down to two principles: 1) attack your enemies, and 2) everyone is an enemy. Melee is a new ability that rewards you for attacking multiple opponents.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/azetllnwjpxztp2b_CN2/en_T9DxnmFdEl.png)


Wings of the Guard  

1W  

Creature — Bird  

1/1  

Flying  

Melee *(Whenever this creature attacks, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn for each opponent you attacked with a creature this combat.)*


The official rules for melee are as follows:


702.120. Melee  

702.120a Melee is a triggered ability. "Melee" means "Whenever this creature attacks, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn for each opponent you attacked with a creature this combat."  

702.120b If a creature has multiple instances of melee, each triggers separately.


* You determine the size of the bonus as the melee ability resolves. Count each opponent that you attacked with one or more creatures. It doesn't matter if the attacking creatures are still attacking or even if they are still on the battlefield. It also doesn't matter if the opponent you attacked is still in the game.
* It doesn't matter how many creatures you attacked a player with, only that you attacked a player with at least one creature. For example, if you attack one player with Wings of the Guard and another player with five creatures, Wings of the Guard will get +2/+2 until end of turn.
* Melee will trigger if the creature with melee attacks a planeswalker. However, the effect counts only opponents (and not planeswalkers) that you attacked with a creature when determining the bonus.
* Creatures that enter the battlefield attacking were never declared as attackers, so they won't count toward melee's effect. Similarly, if a creature with melee enters the battlefield attacking, melee won't trigger.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, attacking the opposing team counts both players. Melee will give a +2/+2 bonus per attacked team.

**Council's Dilemma**


The council has ties to all the major power players fighting for control...or at least the illusion of control. Council's dilemma is an ability word used to highlight abilities that require each player to vote for one of two effects to occur. An ability word has no rules meaning.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/azetllnwjpxztp2b_CN2/en_MfMEndYMQY.png)


Orchard Elemental  

5G  

Creature — Elemental  

2/2  
*Council's dilemma* — When Orchard Elemental enters the battlefield, starting with you, each player votes for sprout or harvest. Put two +1/+1 counters on Orchard Elemental for each sprout vote. You gain 3 life for each harvest vote.


* Unlike the will of the council cards from the original *Conspiracy* set, where a majority of votes determined what happened, each vote made for a council's dilemma card adds to the ultimate effect.
* The effects of each council's dilemma ability happen in the stated order. First the vote occurs, then the first effect, and finally the second effect.
* Because the votes are made in turn order, each player will know the votes of players who voted beforehand.
* You must vote for one of the available options. You can't abstain.
* If a creature with an enters-the-battlefield council's dilemma ability leaves the battlefield before that ability resolves, players can still vote for any option that would put +1/+1 counters on that creature, even though—or perhaps especially because—those votes won't generate an effect.
* No player votes until the spell or ability resolves. Any responses to that spell or ability must be made without knowing the outcome of the vote.
* Players can't do anything between voting and finishing the resolution of the spell or ability that included the vote.



---

**Returning Theme: Draft Abilities**


Start plotting against your foes before the game even begins. Several cards in the *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* set have abilities that function during the draft.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/azetllnwjpxztp2b_CN2/en_b2sLMIrRbQ.png)


Leovold's Operative  

2G  

Creature — Elf Rogue  

3/2  

Draft Leovold's Operative face up.  

As you draft a card, you may draft an additional card from that booster pack. If you do, turn Leovold's Operative face down, then pass the next booster pack without drafting a card from it. *(You may look at that booster pack.)*


* Some cards have abilities that instruct you to draft them face up. These cards remain face up throughout the draft, and any abilities they have relevant to the draft function at that time. Some of these abilities allow you to turn the card face down one time for an effect.
* Other cards have abilities that instruct you to reveal them as you draft them. These abilities have additional instructions that you complete as you draft the card. After you do what the card tells you to do, it's placed face down with your other drafted cards.
* Some cards instruct you to note information as you draft them, such as a number or another card. This information is then referred to by other abilities that function during the game. This information is considered public during the draft and subsequent games.
* If a card instructs you to reveal it or draft it face up during the draft, that doesn't mean you've revealed it for another face up card you've drafted unless you declare that to be the case.
* Some cards refer to a "draft round." Most booster drafts have three draft rounds, each consisting of all players opening one booster pack and drafting all the cards in those booster packs. This term doesn't refer to games played after a draft.
* During the draft, there is no active player, priority, or stack. If two players wish to take an action at the same time during the draft, they do so in a random order.
* You may find it helpful during the draft to make sure all players draft and pass booster packs at the same time. That is, don't let booster packs "pile up" behind any player.

**Returning Card Type: Conspiracy**


Conspiracies add intrigue, uncertainty, and more than a little wackiness to your game. Conspiracies start the game in the command zone, where their abilities shape the war to come.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/azetllnwjpxztp2b_CN2/en_xySfkT1CJD.png)


Hold the Perimeter  

Conspiracy  
*(Start the game with this conspiracy face up in the command zone.)*  

At the beginning of your first upkeep, put a 1/2 white Soldier creature token with defender onto the battlefield.  

At the beginning of each other player's first upkeep, that player puts a 1/1 red Goblin creature token onto the battlefield with "This creature can't block."


* Conspiracies are never put into your deck. Instead, you put any number of conspiracies from your card pool into the command zone as the game starts. These conspiracies are face up unless they have *hidden agenda* (see "Returning Keyword: Hidden Agenda" below) or the new variant *double agenda* (See Summoner's Bond in the "Card-Specific Notes" section below), in which case they begin the game face down.
* A conspiracy doesn't count as a card in your deck for the purposes of meeting minimum deck size requirements. (In most drafts, the minimum deck size is 40 cards.)
* You don't have to play with any conspiracy you draft. However, your only opportunity to put conspiracies into the command zone is as the game starts. You can't put conspiracies into the command zone after this point.
* You can look at any player's face-up conspiracies at any time. You'll also know how many face-down conspiracies a player has in the command zone, although you won't know what they are.
* A conspiracy's static and triggered abilities function as long as that conspiracy is face up in the command zone. A player may activate the activated abilities of face-up conspiracies he or she owns in the command zone.
* Conspiracies are colorless, have no mana cost, and can't be cast as spells.
* Conspiracies aren't legal for any sanctioned Constructed format, but may be included in other Limited formats, such as Cube Draft.



---

**Returning Keyword: Hidden Agenda**


Hidden agenda is a keyword found on some conspiracies. As the game starts, a conspiracy with hidden agenda is put into the command zone face down and a card name is secretly chosen. You can turn a face-down conspiracy face up whenever you have priority, revealing its abilities.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/azetllnwjpxztp2b_CN2/en_hm24SAy5Yc.png)


Hired Heist  

Conspiracy  

Hidden agenda *(Start the game with this conspiracy face down in the command zone and secretly name a card. You may turn this conspiracy face up any time and reveal the chosen name.)*  

Whenever a creature you control with the chosen name deals combat damage to a player, you may pay U. If you do, draw a card.


* You name the card as you put the conspiracy into the command zone at the start of the game, not as you turn the face-down conspiracy face up.
* There are several ways to secretly name a card, including writing the name on a piece of paper that's kept with the face-down conspiracy. If you have multiple face-down conspiracies, you may name a different card for each one. It's important that each chosen name is clearly associated with only one of the conspiracies.
* You must name a *Magic* card. Notably, you can't name a token (except in the unusual case that a token's name matches the name of an existing card, such as Illusion).
* As a special action, you may turn a face-down conspiracy face up. You may do so any time you have priority. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Once a conspiracy is face up, its abilities will affect the game.
* A conspiracy with hidden agenda that has a triggered ability must be face up before that ability's trigger condition is met in order for it to trigger. Turning it face up afterward won't have any effect.
* If you play multiple games after the draft, you can name a different card for each conspiracy with hidden agenda in each new game.
* At the end of the game, you must reveal any face-down conspiracies you own in the command zone to all players. Notably, you can't bluff conspiracies with hidden agenda by putting other cards into the command zone face down as the game starts.
* Summoner's Bond has double agenda, a variant of hidden agenda. It works the same way as hidden agenda except that two names are secretly chosen rather than one.

CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES
===================


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/azetllnwjpxztp2b_CN2/en_1uHM8WvUa4.png)


Adriana's Valor  

Conspiracy  

Hidden agenda *(Start the game with this conspiracy face down in the command zone and secretly name a card. You may turn this conspiracy face up any time and reveal the chosen name.)*  

Whenever a creature you control with the chosen name attacks, you may pay W. If you do, that creature gains indestructible until end of turn. *(Damage and effects that say "destroy" don't destroy it.)*


* The last ability triggers once for each creature with the chosen name that attacks. You choose whether to pay W as the ability resolves. Notably, someone could respond to the ability and destroy the creature before it gains indestructible.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/azetllnwjpxztp2b_CN2/en_3KgbDrIMaO.png)


Animus of Predation  

4G  

Creature — Avatar  

4/4  

Draft Animus of Predation face up.  

As you draft a card, you may remove it from the draft face up. *(It isn't in your card pool.)*  

If you removed a creature card with flying from the draft with cards named Animus of Predation, Animus of Predation has flying. The same is true for first strike, double strike, deathtouch, haste, hexproof, indestructible, lifelink, menace, reach, and vigilance.


* You can remove from the draft any card you draft after Animus of Predation.
* If a card you remove requires you to reveal it as you draft it, do so and follow any additional instructions it may have related to drafting it. However, if a card you remove instructs you to draft it face up, it has no effect while face up and can't be turned face down to use an ability.
* Some cards allow you to exile other cards you've drafted that aren't in your deck before the game starts. Cards you removed from the draft with Animus of Predation can't be exiled this way because they aren't in your card pool.
* The last ability of Animus of Predation functions only if Animus of Predation is on the battlefield. For example, Animus of Predation is not a creature card with flying in your library or graveyard.

Arcane Savant  

3UU  

Creature — Human Wizard  

3/3  

Before you shuffle your deck to start the game, you may reveal this card from your deck and exile an instant or sorcery card you drafted that isn't in your deck.  

When Arcane Savant enters the battlefield, copy a card you exiled with cards named Arcane Savant. You may cast the copy without paying its mana cost.


* If you have more than one Arcane Savant in your deck, you may reveal any number of them and exile that many instant or sorcery cards you drafted that aren't in your deck.
* As Arcane Savant's last ability resolves, if there are multiple cards you exiled with cards named Arcane Savant, you choose one of them to copy.
* The copy is created in and cast from exile. You cast the copy during the resolution of Arcane Savant's last ability. You ignore any timing restrictions based on the card type of the card you copied. However, you must still follow any other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat."
* You can't pay any alternative costs the card has. You can pay additional costs, and if the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the copied card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value when casting the copy.

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/azetllnwjpxztp2b_CN2/en_FV0Fd7eOhp.png)


Archdemon of Paliano  

2BB  

Creature — Demon  

5/4  

Draft Archdemon of Paliano face up.  

As long as Archdemon of Paliano is face up during the draft, you can't look at booster packs and must draft cards at random. After you draft three cards this way, turn Archdemon of Paliano face down. *(You may look at cards as you draft them.)*  

Flying


* Once Archdemon of Paliano is turned face down, you may look at booster packs and draft cards as normal.
* After you draft a card at random, look at it to determine whether it needs to be revealed as it's drafted or drafted face up. If it does, follow its instructions as normal.
* If you have more than one face-up Archdemon of Paliano, keep track of the number of cards you've drafted at random for each one. Each card you draft at random counts toward the demands of all your Archdemons. While you're doing this, consider carefully why the Archdemon seems to favor you.

Ballot Broker  

2W  

Creature — Human Advisor  

2/3  

While voting, you may vote an additional time. *(The votes can be for different choices or for the same choice.)*


* You make all your votes at the same time. Players who vote after you will know all of your votes when making their own.
* Ballot Broker's ability is cumulative. If you control two of them, you can vote up to three times.
* The ability only affects spells and abilities that use the word "vote." Other cards that involve choices, such as Archangel of Strife, are unaffected.
* You must make your initial vote, even if you decline to vote an additional time.

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/azetllnwjpxztp2b_CN2/en_7Szu3ZNAWq.png)


Besmirch  

1RR  

Sorcery  

Until end of turn, gain control of target creature and it gains haste. Untap and goad that creature. *(Until your next turn, that creature attacks each combat if able and attacks a player other than you if able.)*


* The creature you gain control of must attack during your turn if able.
* Besmirch can target any creature, including one you already control or one that's untapped.
* Gaining control of a creature doesn't cause you to gain control of any Auras or Equipment attached to it.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/azetllnwjpxztp2b_CN2/en_VWc3pfujTG.png)


Borderland Explorer  

1G  

Creature — Elf Scout  

3/1  

When Borderland Explorer enters the battlefield, each player may discard a card. Each player who discarded a card this way may search his or her library for a basic land card, reveal it, put it into his or her hand, then shuffle his or her library.


* Players decide whether or not they're discarding a card in turn order. Each player will know if previous players are discarding, but not what they are discarding. All cards to be discarded are set aside, then revealed and discarded simultaneously. Similarly, all basic land cards searched for are set aside, then revealed simultaneously.

Caller of the Untamed  

3G  

Creature — Elf Shaman  

2/4  

Before you shuffle your deck to start the game, you may reveal this card from your deck and exile a creature card you drafted that isn't in your deck.  

X, T: Put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of a card you exiled with cards named Caller of the Untamed. X is the converted mana cost of that card.


* If you have more than one Caller of the Untamed in your deck, you may reveal any number of them and exile that many creature cards you drafted that aren't in your deck.
* When Caller of the Untamed's last ability resolves, if you exiled multiple cards with converted mana cost equal to X with cards named Caller of the Untamed, you choose one of them. The token will be a copy of that card.
* If there is an X in the mana cost of the exiled creature card, that X is 0. Don't confuse it with the X in the activation cost of Caller of the Untamed's ability.

Canal Courier  

5U  

Creature — Human Rogue  

3/5  

When Canal Courier enters the battlefield, you become the monarch.  

Whenever Canal Courier and another creature attack different players, Canal Courier can't be blocked this combat.


* Attacking a planeswalker isn't the same thing as attacking a player. Both Canal Courier and the other creature must attack different players for the last ability to trigger.

Capital Punishment  

4BB  

Sorcery  
*Council's dilemma* — Starting with you, each player votes for death or taxes. Each opponent sacrifices a creature for each death vote and discards a card for each taxes vote.


* Each opponent chooses an appropriate number of creatures to sacrifice in turn order, then all of those creatures are sacrificed simultaneously. After that is complete, each opponent sets aside an appropriate number of cards to discard in turn order, then all cards are revealed and discarded simultaneously.
* If an opponent controls fewer creatures or has fewer cards in hand than the number of appropriate votes, all those creatures are sacrificed or all those cards are discarded, as applicable.

Reveal Custodi Peacekeeper as you draft it and note how many cards you've drafted this draft round, including Custodi Peacekeeper.  

W, T: Tap target creature with power less than or equal to the highest number you noted for cards named Custodi Peacekeeper.


* For example, if you draft Custodi Peacekeeper as the third card in a draft round and then another one as the sixth card in a draft round, each Custodi Peacekeeper's ability could tap a creature with power 6 or less.
* If you gain control of a Custodi Peacekeeper, but you didn't draft one, the highest noted number is considered to be 0. You can only use it to tap creatures with power 0 or less.

Whenever Custodi Soulcaller attacks, return target creature card with converted mana cost X or less from your graveyard to the battlefield, where X is the number of players you attacked with a creature this combat.


* The value of X in the last ability is calculated in a similar fashion to how melee bonuses are calculated. It doesn't matter if the creatures are still attacking or on the battlefield. It also doesn't matter if the player you attacked is still in the game.

−1: You may sacrifice an artifact. If you do, destroy target artifact or creature.  

−6: Choose target artifact card in a graveyard or artifact on the battlefield. Put three tokens that are copies of it onto the battlefield.


* For the second ability, you choose the target artifact or creature as you activate the ability. You choose whether to sacrifice an artifact and which artifact to sacrifice as the ability resolves.
* For the last ability, if you choose an artifact on the battlefield as the target, and that artifact is no longer on the battlefield as the ability tries to resolve, the ability will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't get any tokens. This is true even if the card that represented that artifact is now in a graveyard. That card will be a different object than it was on the battlefield.

* If the player who controlled Deadly Designs as its last ability triggered doesn't control it as that ability resolves, Deadly Designs won't be sacrificed. However, if it's still on the battlefield and has five or more plot counters on it, its last ability will immediately trigger again.

Echoing Boon  

Conspiracy  

Hidden agenda *(Start the game with this conspiracy face down in the command zone and secretly name a card. You may turn this conspiracy face up any time and reveal the chosen name.)*  

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, if it targets a creature you control with the chosen name, you may copy that spell and may choose new targets for the copy.


* The instant or sorcery spell can target other things as well, as long as one of its targets is a creature you control with the chosen name.
* When Echoing Boon's ability resolves, it creates a copy of the instant or sorcery spell. The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, before the original spell resolves but after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If you can't choose a new legal target for one of the targets, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Subterranean Tremors has), the copy will have the same value of X.
* If the spell being copied has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
* If an alternative cost was paid for the spell being copied, such as a madness cost or surge cost, the same alternative cost is considered to have been paid for the copy.

* Exile the top card of that player's library. Until end of turn, you may cast that card and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any color to cast it.
* The card exiled by the second mode is exiled face up.
* If you exile a land card this way, you can't play it.
* Casting the exiled card follows the normal rules for casting that card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if you exile a creature card this way, you must wait until your main phase to cast it.
* If you don't cast the card, it will remain in exile.

Hymn of the Wilds  

Conspiracy  
*(Start the game with this conspiracy face up in the command zone.)*  

The first creature spell you cast each turn costs 1 less to cast.  

You can't cast instant or sorcery spells.


* The first ability doesn't change the mana cost or converted mana cost of any creature spell. It changes only the total cost you actually pay.
* If you have more than one Hymn of the Wilds in the command zone, their abilities will each apply to the first creature spell you cast each turn. For example, if you have two, the first creature spell you cast each turn costs 2 less to cast. Subsequent creature spells won't get a discount.
* The ability can't affect the amount of colored mana you pay for a spell. It reduces only the generic component of that mana cost.
* The first creature spell you cast each turn doesn't necessarily have to be the first spell you cast. For example, you could cast an artifact spell and then cast a creature spell that would get the discount.
* If there are additional costs to cast a spell, or if the cost to cast a spell is increased by an effect, apply those increases before applying cost reductions.
* The cost reduction can apply to an alternative cost, such as a madness cost.
* If the first creature spell you cast in a turn has X in its mana cost, you choose the value of X before calculating the spell's total cost. For example, if the first creature spell you cast in a turn has a mana cost of XG, you could choose 1 as the value of X and pay G to cast the spell.

* You choose whether or not to target a creature as you activate the first ability. If you chose a target creature, you choose whether to exile Kaya or that creature as the ability resolves. If you chose a creature and that creature is no longer a legal target as the ability tries to resolve, the ability is countered and none of its effects happen. You won't exile Kaya or lose 2 life.
* If you didn't choose a target creature for the first ability, and Kaya isn't on the battlefield as the ability resolves, you'll just lose 2 life. No card will be exiled or returned to the battlefield.
* As the last ability resolves, each opponent will choose a card to discard and set it aside. Then all those cards are revealed and discarded simultaneously.

Legendary Creature — Elf Advisor  

3/3  

Each opponent can't draw more than one card each turn.  

Whenever you or a permanent you control becomes the target of a spell or ability an opponent controls, you may draw a card.


* Your opponents can draw a maximum of one card on each player's turn. Subsequent card draws are ignored.
* If an opponent hasn't drawn any cards in a turn, and a spell or ability instructs a player to draw multiple cards, that player will just draw one card. However, if the draws are an optional cost to generate an additional effect ("[That player] may draw two cards. If he or she does, [effect]" or similar), the player can't pay that cost in full and can't draw any cards.
* Leovold will "see" cards drawn by opponents earlier in the turn on the turn it enters the battlefield, although Leovold can't affect cards drawn before it entered the battlefield. For example, if an opponent draws two cards, then Leovold enters the battlefield, that opponent can't draw more cards that turn, but the two drawn cards are unaffected.
* Replacement effects can't be used to replace draws that Leovold disallows.
* If you and a permanent you control each become the target of the same spell or ability an opponent controls, Leovold's ability will trigger twice.

As you draft a card, you may draft an additional card from that booster pack. If you do, turn Leovold's Operative face down, then pass the next booster pack without drafting a card from it. *(You may look at that booster pack.)*


* You can turn more than one Leovold's Operative face down to draft additional cards from one booster pack. However, for each Leovold's Operative you turn face down, you will skip drafting a card from an additional future booster pack. For example, if you turn three Leovold's Operatives face down as you draft a card from a booster pack, you may draft three additional cards from that booster pack. You then won't draft a card from the next three booster packs you are passed (and/or open).

As long as you control one or more creatures with a name you noted for cards named Noble Banneret, Noble Banneret and those creatures get +1/+1 and have lifelink.


* The creature card you reveal during the draft can be another Noble Banneret. That second Noble Banneret will then be face up for a future creature card to be revealed. If Noble Banneret is one of the names you noted, a Noble Banneret that's the only creature you control will get +1/+1 and have lifelink.

When Palace Jailer enters the battlefield, you become the monarch.  

When Palace Jailer enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls until an opponent becomes the monarch. *(That creature returns under its owner's control.)*


* Palace Jailer's two abilities can be put on the stack in either order. The last one to be put onto the stack will resolve first.
* If you're not the monarch as the second ability resolves, the creature will be exiled until there's a new monarch and that player is one of your opponents. The creature won't immediately return just because an opponent is the monarch.
* Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
* If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't return to the battlefield.
* Palace Jailer leaving the battlefield won't cause the exiled creature to return. The game will continue to watch for the next time an opponent becomes the monarch.
* The opponent that controlled the exiled card doesn't have to be the same opponent that becomes the monarch in order to cause that card to return to the battlefield. Any opponent becoming the monarch will cause the card to return.
* The exiled creature will return to the battlefield just after the opponent becomes the monarch.
* In some unusual cases, Palace Jailer's owner will leave the game while not being the monarch. In this case, nothing happens immediately, but the exiled creature will return to the battlefield the next time one of that player's opponents becomes the monarch.

Creature — Giant Soldier  

2/5  

When Protector of the Crown enters the battlefield, you become the monarch.  

All damage that would be dealt to you is dealt to Protector of the Crown instead.


* Protector of the Crown's last ability doesn't depend on you being the monarch. It will create a redirection effect even if an opponent is the monarch.
* Applying this redirection effect doesn't change whether the damage is combat damage.
* If you control both Protector of the Crown and a planeswalker, and noncombat damage would be dealt to you, you choose the order in which Protector of the Crown's redirection effect and the planeswalker redirection effect apply. If damage is redirected to Protector of the Crown first, the planeswalker redirection effect won't apply. If you apply the planeswalker redirection effect first, the controller of the damage source chooses whether the damage will be dealt to the planeswalker or ultimately to Protector of the Crown.
* If you control more than one Protector of the Crown, you choose which redirection effect to apply. You can't divide damage dealt by one source. For example, if an attacking creature would deal 6 damage to you and you control two Protectors of the Crown, you may have that damage dealt to either of the Protectors. You can't have 3 damage dealt to each one.

* If Pyretic Hunter enters the battlefield under your control, but you didn't draft one, the highest noted number is considered to be 0. It will enter with zero +1/+1 counters and will be put into its owner's graveyard (unless something else is raising its toughness).

Destroy target creature that's one or more of the colors chosen as you drafted cards named Regicide.


* The three chosen colors must be different from one another.
* If you draft another Regicide, any additional colors chosen will count for each Regicide you've drafted.
* The target creature can be colors that weren't chosen as long as it's also one or more colors that were. For example, if the chosen colors were red, white, and green, Regicide could target a creature that's white and black.
* Regicide can't target colorless creatures.
* If a card would allow you to cast a Regicide but you didn't draft one, you won't be able to cast it because you won't be able to choose a legal target.
* If you copy or gain control of a Regicide that's already on the stack but you didn't draft one, you won't be able to choose a new target and Regicide will be countered as it tries to resolve. The target creature won't be destroyed. On the other hand, if you did draft a Regicide, use the set of colors chosen as you drafted cards named Regicide when choosing a new target (if applicable) or determining if the resolving Regicide's target is legal.

* For spells with X in their mana costs, use the value chosen for X to determine if the spell's converted mana cost is the chosen number. For example, if the chosen number is 4, a noncreature spell with mana cost XRR couldn't be cast with X equal to 2, but it could be cast with X equal to any other number.

Whenever another creature enters the battlefield, its controller may draw a card if its power is greater than each other creature's power.  

G, T: Add X mana in any combination of colors to your mana pool, where X is the greatest power among creatures you control.

* If the new creature isn't on the battlefield as the first ability resolves, use its power when it left the battlefield to determine whether its controller may draw a card. Note that effects that reduced its power before it left the battlefield will apply.

3BB: Monstrosity 3. *(If this creature isn't monstrous, put three +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes monstrous.)*  

As long as Sinuous Vermin is monstrous, it has menace. *(It can't be blocked except by two or more creatures.)*


* Once Sinuous Vermin has been legally blocked by one creature, activating the monstrosity ability to give it menace won't change or undo that block.

Skyline Despot  

5RR  

Creature — Dragon  

5/5  

Flying  

When Skyline Despot enters the battlefield, you become the monarch.


At the beginning of your upkeep, if you're the monarch, put a 5/5 red Dragon creature token with flying onto the battlefield.


* The last ability of Skyline Despot checks to see if you're the monarch as your upkeep begins. If you're not, the ability won't trigger at all. You won't be able to do anything that would make you the monarch during your upkeep in time to have that ability trigger. The ability will also check to see if you're the monarch as it tries to resolve. If you're not the monarch at that time, the ability will have no effect.

Smuggler Captain  

3B  

Creature — Human Pirate  

2/2  

Draft Smuggler Captain face up.  

As you draft a card, you may reveal it, note its name, then turn Smuggler Captain face down.  

When Smuggler Captain enters the battlefield, you may search your library for a card with a name you noted for cards named Smuggler Captain, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.


* If a Smuggler Captain enters the battlefield under your control, but you didn't draft one, there will be no applicable noted names. You may search and shuffle your library, but you can't find any cards.

Sovereign's Realm  

Conspiracy  
*(Start the game with this conspiracy face up in the command zone.)*  

Your deck can't have basic land cards and your starting hand size is five.  

Exile a card from your hand: This turn, you may play basic land cards from outside the game.  

Basic lands you control have "T: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool."


* Even though your starting hand size is five, nothing else about the pregame procedure changes. If you don't take two or more mulligans in a multiplayer game, you won't be able to "scry" before the game starts.
* Unless an effect states otherwise, you are still limited to one land play on each of your turns. Activating the ability of Sovereign's Realm multiple times on your turn has no additional benefit.
* In Limited and Constructed events, "outside the game" means your sideboard. Your sideboard is considered to have as many cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest as needed. You don't have to draft such cards.
* If you're drafting with other sets and draft basic land cards other than the five mentioned above (including Wastes and the "Snow-Covered" versions of the typical basic lands), those cards will be in your sideboard and the activated ability of Sovereign's Realm will allow you to play them. Also, invite me to your next draft—your group sounds rad.
* The ability of Sovereign's Realm doesn't change when you can play lands. You can still only play them during your main phase, if the stack is empty, if you have priority, and if you have an available land play.
* You can never play lands on another player's turn. Activating the ability of Sovereign's Realm during an opponent's turn won't allow you to play lands that turn.

Spire Phantasm  

2UU  

Creature — Gargoyle Illusion  

3/2  

Reveal Spire Phantasm as you draft it. The next time a player drafts a card from this booster pack, guess that card's name. Then that player reveals the drafted card.  

Flying  

When Spire Phantasm enters the battlefield, if you guessed correctly for a card named Spire Phantasm, draw a card.


* Typically, the next player will set aside the card he or she intends to draft, you'll make your guess, then the card will be revealed. You can make your guess before the player drafts a card to make things ~~weird~~ more interesting.
* If Spire Phantasm is the last card drafted from a booster pack, no guessing game will be played.

Splitting Slime  

3GG  

Creature — Ooze  

3/3  

4GG: Monstrosity 3. *(If this creature isn't monstrous, put three +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes monstrous.)*  

When Splitting Slime becomes monstrous, put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of Splitting Slime. *(The token has no counters and isn't monstrous.)*


* The token that's put onto the battlefield isn't monstrous at first. If you activate the token's ability, it will get counters, it will become monstrous, and a new token will be put onto the battlefield.

Spy Kit  

2  

Artifact — Equipment  

Equipped creature gets +1/+1 and has all names of nonlegendary creature cards in addition to its name.  

Equip 2


* The set of names the equipped creature has includes the names of all nonlegendary creature cards in the Oracle card reference, including the back faces of double-faced cards. Notably, the equipped creature won't gain the names of tokens, such as Zombie, Goblin, and similar. It also won't gain the names of noncreature cards that have become creatures, such as a Wandering Fumarole that has become a creature.
* If you named any nonlegendary creature card for hidden agenda or draft abilities that refer to a creature on the battlefield, the equipped creature will have that name and will qualify for any relevant bonuses. For example, equipping Spy Kit to Noble Banneret will enable Noble Banneret's last ability (as long as you noted a nonlegendary card name for it).
* Some creature cards have abilities that function during the draft and additional abilities that refer to cards you exiled or information you noted with "cards named [this card's name]." These abilities are linked, so equipping Spy Kit to such a creature won't affect the set of cards it exiled or the information you noted.

Stunt Double  

3U  

Creature — Shapeshifter  

0/0  

Flash  

You may have Stunt Double enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield.


* Stunt Double copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* If the copied creature has X in its mana cost, that X is considered to be 0.
* If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Stunt Double), then Stunt Double enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
* If the chosen creature is a token, Stunt Double copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. Stunt Double isn't a token.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Stunt Double enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
* If Stunt Double somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that's already on the battlefield.
* You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Stunt Double enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature and is put into the graveyard immediately (unless something else is raising its toughness).

Summoner's Bond  

Conspiracy  

Double agenda *(Start the game with this conspiracy face down in the command zone and secretly name two different cards. You may turn this conspiracy face up any time and reveal the chosen names.)*  

Whenever you cast a creature spell with one of the chosen names, you may search your library for a creature card with the other chosen name, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.


* Double agenda is a variant of hidden agenda. The only difference is you secretly name two different cards instead of one.
* The last ability of Summoner's Bond will resolve before the creature spell that caused it to trigger.

Throne Warden  

1W  

Creature — Human Soldier  

2/2  

At the beginning of your end step, if you're the monarch, put a +1/+1 counter on Throne Warden.


* The last ability of Throne Warden checks to see if you're the monarch as your end step begins. If you're not, the ability won't trigger at all. You won't be able to do anything that would make you the monarch during your end step in time to have that ability trigger. The ability will also check to see if you're the monarch as it tries to resolve. If you're not the monarch at that time, the ability will have no effect.

Volatile Chimera  

2R  

Creature — Elemental Chimera  

3/2  

Before you shuffle your deck to start the game, you may reveal this card from your deck and exile three or more creature cards you drafted that aren't in your deck.  

1R: Choose a card at random you exiled with cards named Volatile Chimera. Volatile Chimera becomes a copy of that card and gains this ability.


* Unlike the other two cards with this style of ability (Arcane Savant and Caller of the Untamed), if you have more than one Volatile Chimera in your deck, you need only reveal one of them because you can exile as many creature cards that aren't in your deck as you want, with a minimum of three. If you do reveal more than one Volatile Chimera before shuffling, you'll have to exile at least three creature cards for each of them.
* The copy effect created by the activated ability doesn't have a duration. It will last until Volatile Chimera leaves the battlefield or another copy effect overwrites it.
* No enters-the-battlefield abilities of the creature card Volatile Chimera is copying will trigger. Volatile Chimera was already on the battlefield.
* After Volatile Chimera copies a creature card, that card remains in the pool of cards you can choose with the last ability.

Weight Advantage  

Conspiracy  
*(Start the game with this conspiracy face up in the command zone.)*  

Each creature you control assigns combat damage equal to its toughness rather than its power.


* For example, a 2/3 creature will assign 3 combat damage rather than 2.
* Weight Advantage's ability doesn't change any creature's power. It changes only the value of the combat damage it assigns. All other rules and effects that check power or toughness use the real values.
