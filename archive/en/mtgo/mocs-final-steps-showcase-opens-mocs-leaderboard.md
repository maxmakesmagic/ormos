SHOWCASE OPENS & MOCS LEADERBOARD
---------------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events. MOCS is a set of linked tournaments designed to highlight the game's best players each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and an invitation to an upcoming Championship on *MTG Arena*.

**NOTES**:


* Each event in *Magic Online* has a maximum number of players *(as indicated below)* and events at the end of each season are likely to have more players. Once an event fills, no further entries will be allowed, so plan your QP usage accordingly.
* Players must be at least age 13 to play *Magic Online*. Players under age 18 on the date of the qualifying event are permitted to win digital prizes but are ineligible to be awarded invitations to Championships or the *Magic Online* Champions Showcase.
* Players already invited to the next Championship remain eligible to compete in Qualifiers, Super Qualifiers, and Champions Showcase events except as noted below.
* Should an already invited or ineligible player win a redundant Championship invitation, that invite will pass down to the next highest placed eligible player.

SHOWCASE OPENS
==============


Unlike the multistep path shown above, Showcase Opens allow anyone a final opportunity to earn an invitation to the Champions Showcase. Players don't need to earn points or another qualification to enter, and because these events are Sealed, players don't even need a deck.


The winner of each Open will get an invitation to the Showcase, while both the winner and the runner-up will earn an invitation to an upcoming Championship event on *MTG Arena*.


**Start Times**: As listed in the Premier Play Schedule  
**Format**: As listed in the Premier Play Schedule  
**Product**: 6 boosters of a recent Magic set, with 3 extra boosters for players in the Top 8 draft  
**Location**: The Limited lobby under Premier Events  
**Entry Options**:


* 40 Event Tickets
* 400 Play Points

**Size**: 33–672 players  
**Play Style**: Swiss, with a single-elimination Top 8  
**Duration**: 20 minutes for deck building, then a number of rounds determined by entries, Swiss pairings, each round up to 50 minutes, followed by a single elimination Top 8 draft  
**Prizes**:

MOCS LEADERBOARD
================


In 2022, the Top 8 finishers of certain events that include playoff rounds will earn Leaderboard Points. These appear as objects on your account (under the Trophies section of your Collection) and will be tracked publicly on [this page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/leaderboard).


Events that count for the Season 1 Leaderboard are:


* December 15–April 10: Qualifiers, Super Qualifiers and Showcase Challenges
* April 16–May 1: Showcase Qualifiers and Showcase Opens

Here is the distribution of Leaderboard Points by event type:





| EVENT | 1st PLACE | 2nd PLACE | 3rd–4th PLACE | 5th–8th PLACE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Qualifier | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 |
| Super Qualifier | 10 | 10 | 8 | 7 |
| Showcase Challenge | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 |
| Showcase Qualifier | None | 12 | 10 | 7 |
| Showcase Open | None | 8 | 7 | 6 |


Following the last Showcase Open of a Season, the two players with the most Leaderboard Points who are not already qualified will earn invitations to the Champions Showcase as well as an upcoming Championship event on *MTG Arena*.


Ties for Leaderboard invitations will be broken as follows, in order:


* Most Top 8 finishes among events counting toward this Leaderboard
* Most Leaderboard Points earned in a single eligible event
* Most Qualifier Points earned during the Leaderboard's Season *(e.g., for Season 1: December 15*–*April 13)*

**NOTE**: If a Leaderboard invitee already holds an invitation to the upcoming Championship on *MTG Arena*, that Championship invitation will pass down to the next highest uninvited player on the Leaderboard.
