Of the four quarterfinals, this was easily the most casual. Featuring two local players who know each other well, this quarterfinal matchup pits Steven Tan's Affinity against Tay Jun Hao's 4-Color Company, brewed by Pro Tour Return to Ravnica Top 8'er, Kelvin Chew.


This will be Tan's third Top 8, although first in a Constructed format, while Tay is a newcomer who has just earned his first Top 8 appearance.


Game 1
======


Placing higher in the Swiss rounds, Tan naturally chose to go first, opening with Memnite and [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) before adding a pair of [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest)s to the board.

In an attempt to stem the bleeding, Tay cracked his [Windswept Heath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath) for a Plains and showed [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile).


Tay: "Do you have any recommendations?"


Tan: "I suggest the Memnite. Absolutely!"


One [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) went to exile, while [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) came down to block. [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) on [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) got around that, and was delayed for a turn by [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch). No fourth land showed up for Tay, who had to pass without any play.


[Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) and [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) had Tay reaching for his sideboard.


Tan: "Why do you have so many Forests?!"


Tay: "I'm poor. I can't afford shocklands"


Tan: "I'll lend you shocklands if you want."


Tay: "Ask the judge if I can change my deck!"


**Steven Tan 1 – Tay Junhao 0**


Game 2
======


The second game went marginally slower, with [Darksteel Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel) into [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) paving the way for [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) to bring out [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) on Turn 2. Tay simply laid three lands. [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) came out and quadrupled Tay's clock, who could only muster up a [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) for defense.

With no way to destroy artifacts en-masse, Tay was quickly rendered helpless to the mechanical onslaught. A second [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) and [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) was just icing on the cake.
