**Reduced *Magic Online* Downtimes Starting In March**


In an effort to make sure *Magic Online* is available when you want to play *Magic*, we’re working on ways to reduce the number of times we have to bring the system offline for maintenance. As a first step we’re simply going to eliminate at least one downtime each month.


Here are the dates of the exact downtimes we’ll be skipping in the first half of 2016:


* March 16
* April 6
* April 20
* May 11
* June 8
* June 22

During these weeks without a downtime *Magic Online* will NOT be processing set redemptions. Redemption orders placed that week will be processed during the subsequent downtime, so please plan accordingly.
