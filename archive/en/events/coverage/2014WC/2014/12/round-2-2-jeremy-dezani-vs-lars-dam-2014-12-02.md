The round started with a seemingly simple question: "How did he kill your regenerator?" Lars Dam asked second-ranked Pro Tour *Theros* winner Jérémy Dezani.


"He didn't." Dezani answered.


"How did he win then?"


"His guy was bigger."


"He just trampled through?" Dam sounded a bit incredulous but he didn't laugh at [Armadillo Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armadillo+Cloak): it worked for Paul Rietzl.


Dam had been watching the first round marathon match between his second round opponent and Hall of Fame member Paul Rietzl. Featuring aura-enhanced monsters and a [Claws of Wirewood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Claws+of+Wirewood) that drew a game, it was a spectacle other players couldn't help but watch.


There may have been another reason Dam was watching the match closely: his qualification for the World Championship came from the *Magic Online* Championship, and his qualification there came from being Limited player of the Year for *Magic Online*. Drafting at the World Championship seemed straightforward to Dam to earn some points, and previous *Magic Online* champions had an established pedigree of performance. Just check up on how "little-known" Reid Duke (currently third-ranked) and Dimitriy Butakov have done since their respective first adventures in the World Championship.


Dezani entered the World Championship with an impressive resume of facts for the year: 2014 Player of the Year title, winner of Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*, and two Grand Prix titles among several Top 8s. His string of top finishes and high-level performance made him a strong contender for the event. When he plays the best in the world he's often been the victor.

The Decks
=========



Dezani had drafted the Blue-Green Madness deck, using cards like [Frantic Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search) and [Obsessive Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsessive+Search) to dig down to key cards like [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) and [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla). The ability to quickly present powerful threats and back them up with countermagic and creature buffs makes it a classic archetype players still love today.


Dam took a different path to building his deck: [Predator, Flagship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%2C+Flagship) with an array of black removal, and aggressive white creatures.


"From what I've seen black isn't very good but it ended up being extremely open," Dam said about his draft. "[Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) ended up wheeling in the second pack. I was drafting an aggressive white deck but I abandoned my first pick [Goblin Trenches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Trenches) and got rewarded: double [Death Grasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Grasp), [Expunge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expunge), double [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict)."


"I knew going in that I wanted to be in white," he continued. "I feel it's the strongest color by far. [Battle Screech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech) is almost unbeatable when you cast it on turn four and flash it back right away. The aggressive two-drops are very good. Most other colors lack two-drops that are very good: they all have drawbacks. White's two-drops are hard to stop very early."


The Games
=========


Dezani opened with [Mana Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Vault) but didn't follow through on a play until Dam attacked with [Phantom Nomad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Nomad): [Frantic Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search) into a madness [Obsessive Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsessive+Search). Digging for action, [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) tokens were first met by [Expunge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expunge), then [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) by Dam, ahead on board with creatures. Despite the big creature, [Misthollow Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misthollow+Griffin) and a tapped [Mana Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Vault) quickly ate away the little life Dezeni had left.

"I'll play first."



Those were the only words exchanged between games, as Dezani went into the second game looking for a rebound. Dam led with [Stoic Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Champion), though Dezani bought significant time with [Man-o'-War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Man-o%27-War). He threatened to end it quickly with [Elephant Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Guide) the following turn. Dam forced the 5/5 down into a 3/3 [Elephant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant) token before a second [Elephant Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Guide) made that 6/6. Dezani continued to press in and dropped Dam to just 6 life. An [Æther Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Mutation) later a quick second game was over.


This time there were no words at all as both players looked to find their first match win in the tournament. [Stoic Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Champion) was Dam's start again, with [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) taking care of an early [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) from Dezani. Though Dezani was stuck on Islands for several turns, Dam wasn't able to take advantage of the time by casting more creatures. [Saproling Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saproling+Burst) changed the battlefield when Dezani hit his Forest on the fifth turn, but with six lands of his own Dam made [Predator, Flagship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%2C+Flagship).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/2014WC/r2_dezani.jpg)*Dezani, the reigning Player of the Year, is hoping to start out the tournament strong.* 




Falling to 9 life, Dam used [Radiant's Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant%27s+Judgment) and [Nature's Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Ruin) to slow Dezani's [Saproling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saproling)s and friends down. After [Saproling Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saproling+Burst) ran out of steam, Dezani traded his [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s away to stop Dam from resolving creatures. All throughout [Predator, Flagship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%2C+Flagship) and Dam's removal kept his life total healthy.



Gaining a little life with [Death Grasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Grasp) kept Dam afloat during the brief moments Dezani could hit damage, and that was all Dam needed. The methodical work of [Predator, Flagship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%2C+Flagship) whittled Dezani down to one card in hand with just a few more left in his library.


Resolving [Battle Screech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech) was enough for Dam to finally push through for the win.


How much did the *Magic Online*Limited Player of the Year prepare for *Vintage Masters* draft? "Not a lot," Dam admitted. "When it came back on *Magic Online* I did like three or four drafts, but I've watched a lot more on Twitch so I knew what was going on."


You heard it here first: Some of the best in the game learn from the *Magic Online* streams of everyone else.
