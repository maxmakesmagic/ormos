Eight players entered the feature match area to kick off the Top 8 of Grand Prix Kobe, but only 4 would remain after the Quarterfinals. Here is a roundup from the quarterfinals.


Shunsuke Takahira (Abzan) vs. Joe Soh (Mardu)
=============================================


The first game was a battle of armies. Takahira created a fierce one with 2 copies of [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree), while Soh had [Bloodsoaked Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodsoaked+Champion), [Chief of the Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chief+of+the+Edge), and [Blood-Chin Rager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Chin+Rager). Takahira quickly fell to 7 life and, when, Soh used a pair of removal spells he was able to take the first game.

The second game featured a fourth turn [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) from Joe Soh. The two traded creatures back in forth, but Takahira was unable to deal with the planeswalker and Soh advanced to the semifinals a few turns later.


Akio Chiba (Esper Dragons) vs. Akihiro Okawa (W/B Tokens)
=========================================================


The only early threat that Okawa was able to get down in game 1 was [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid). Chiba was able to play a [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) and transform it quickly, neutralizing the Knight. With a grip full of countermagic, he was patient to resolve his [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai). Once he did, he took the first game.

The second game started similarly to the first: Chiba got out an early Jace and began to control the game with countermagic. Many turns later, he cast [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) and [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death) and from there took the match and started preparing for the semifinals.


Takuma Morofuji (Atarka Red) vs. Shuhei Nakamura (Esper Dragons)
================================================================


Morofuji came out of the gates very quickly game 1 with [Lightning Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Berserker), [Dragon Fodder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Fodder), and [Violent Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Outburst). Both players began to stall out on lands, but this favored the red player. Without answers to Morofuji's creatures, Nakamura succumbed a few turns later.

Shuhei's sideboard netted him [Arashin Cleric](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashin+Cleric)s for the second game, which he used in game 2 to stem the early bleeding from Morofuji. Despite this, Shuhei quickly fell to 4 life before finding a [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate) to clear Morofuji's Board. A couple turns later, Morofuji was able to find the final points of burn to take out the Pro Tour Hall of Famer and head to the semifinals.


Pavel Matousek (Eldrazi Ramp) vs. Shota Takao (Esper Tokens)
============================================================


In the first game Matousek had access to 8 mana on the fourth turn, while Takao cast a Gideon on his 4th turn, Matousek cast Ugin and wiped Takao's board. Ugin died to [Ruinous Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruinous+Path) on the following turn, but Matousek had two copies of [Part the Waterveil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Part+the+Waterveil) to take the first game.

Game 2 began with Takao generating a fierce army very quickly. Matousek wasn't able to ramp particularly quickly and was forced to use a [Part the Waterveil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Part+the+Waterveil) offensively. When his extra turn netted him nothing, Takao sent the match to a third game.


In game 3, Matousek's early ramp in the form of creatures was met with removal spells. Stuck on three mana sources and a hand full of expensive spells, Takao was able to get out and protect an [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar). Without any land, Matousek fell to the Gideon and Shota Takao advanced to the Semifinals.
