![Playtest cards](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/making/58_playtest.jpg)One of the perks of being in R&D is that part of your job is joining playtests. We have certain playtests at the same time every week. Others are put together spontaneously. Such a playtest has been put together this morning.

The development team is testing out the latest set and they’re looking for other R&D members to join in. Sounds like fun. As you sit down to build your deck, you think, “I’m not goofing off. This is my job.”

Unlike in real **Magic**, the card collation in playtests is horrible. You get only two white creatures. Luckily, you go three copies of a red card you consider broken. You objective today is to demonstrate how good this guy is.

Mid-playtest the card gets changed (you were doing a little too good with it); in fact, in the middle of one of your games a developer scribbles new numbers on your card with a ballpoint pen. As such, the power of your deck drops significantly. Ah, well. You end up going 3-1.

Boy, time has flown. Time for your meeting.
