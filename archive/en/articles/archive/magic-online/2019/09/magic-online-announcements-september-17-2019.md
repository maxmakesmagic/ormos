*Magic Online* & Eternal Weekend North America
----------------------------------------------


Eternal formats are awesome, and we're happy to announce that *Magic Online* is partnering with Card Titan to provide support for Eternal Weekend North America October 31 through November 3 in Pittsburgh, PA!


At Eternal Weekend, we've contributed *Magic Online* digital prizes to each Championship. The prizes for the championship events include:


* 1st–2nd: One full set of each Vintage-legal booster expansion released on *Magic Online* (Digital)
* 3rd–4th: One full set of *Vintage Masters* plus one full set of *Modern Horizons* (Digital)
* 5th–8th: Eighteen *Vintage Masters* booster packs plus eighteen *Modern Horizons* booster packs (Digital)

We've also contributed prizes to the Prize Wall, including *Vintage Masters* and *Modern Masters* booster packs (Digital).


In addition to prizes, the winner of each Modern, Legacy, and Vintage Challenge hosted on *Magic Online* from September 21 through October 13 will earn a bye in the corresponding championship event at Eternal Weekend. These bye awards do not pass down, but players can earn up to two byes in each format (obviously, byes can only be used at the Eternal Weekend event in Pittsburgh).


If you're a fan of eternal *Magic*, you don't want to miss this event. Check out the Card Titan website for all the details and good luck.

Modern Cube Continued
---------------------


The Modern Cube is a great way to try out all the iconic cards and synergies that shape one of *Magic*'s most dynamic formats. Modern Cube can be found in the Limited Leagues section of the Play Lobby and will run through September 26, with the start of *Throne of Eldraine* events. Here are some words from Reggie Valk of *Magic* R&D about this year's Modern Cube:


*"The guiding principle behind this last batch of changes was to introduce relevant cards from the sets that came out since [Modern Cube] was last updated (November 2018), which ended up including RNA, WAR, MH1, and M20. Aside from including a lot of the more obvious inclusions due to iconic status and Modern playability (like Urza, Wrenn and Six, etc.), I also tried to update the Cube to have some cards and strategies that align with popular Modern strategies currently, which is why things like Arclight Phoenix and Duskwatch Recruiter were introduced. I also was cognizant of the amount of planeswalkers in this cube as that has been its largest criticism by far, so despite WAR adding a lot of cool new PWs, the number stayed the same and, if anything, should only go down from here."*

Vintage & Pauper Playoff Winners

Congratulations to The Atog Lord (Vintage) and federusher (Pauper), the winners of last weekend's Format Playoffs! A very special mention also to those who have qualified for Format Championships—to view the list of invites so far, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/format-championship-invites).

Limited MOCS Open Saturday
--------------------------


A MOCS Open will take place on Saturday, September 21, beginning at 7 a.m. PT. The format is *Core Set 2020* Sealed Deck, and players may join with 40 Event Tickets or 400 Play Points. These events are not phantom, and the contents of the packs opened will be added to participants' collections.


The winner earns invitations to the 2019 *Magic Online* Championship (date in 2020 TBD) as well as their choice of Players Tour regional events in February 2020. Leaderboard Points in the year-long race for At-Large berths in the Championship are also up for grabs. In addition, as described in MOCS rules for 2019, since this MOCS Open happens within two weeks of a new set release, the prizes for this event will be *Throne of Eldraine* booster packs. Since *Throne of Eldraine* won't be available at the time of the event, this means that no prizes will be awarded at the completion of the event, and instead, prizes will be granted by 5:00 p.m. PT on Friday, September 27, 2019.

Limited MOCS Preliminary Sunday

The format will be Phantom Sealed, the set will be *Core Set 2020*, and things will kick off at 7 a.m. PT. MOCS Preliminaries are eight rounds of Swiss and require 35 Qualifier Points to enter. Players with 6 or more wins will earn an invitation to the next MOCS Playoff event on Saturday, October 5. This is the last chance to qualify for that Playoff event.
