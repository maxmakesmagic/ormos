At [Pro Tour*Magic 2015*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptm15), Jackson Cunningham took the tournament by storm, nearly winning the whole thing in his first Pro Tour and one of his first Constructed tournaments, *ever*.


If that sounds impressive, it certainly is. But it shouldn't necessarily be surprising given his lineage. Cunningham was taught to play *Magic* by his older brother, Jeff Cunningham, a longtime pro with 152 Pro Points and a Pro Tour Top 8 on his resume.


So that got us thinking about other brothers and family members in *Magic*. Not among players (that list at the top levels is actually pretty small), but among the cards.


There are, for example, just three brothers in all of *Magic*.

There are even fewer sisters.

Now, I'm not entirely sure how there are so few brothers and sisters but so very many mothers in *Magic*. Maybe the Multiverse is full of only children?

There are no "fathers," "dads," or the like in the game, although there are plenty of father-figures who aren't named as such. For example, this *Homelands* stalwart:


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Baron%20Sengir)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron%20Sengir)
[Baron Sengir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir) was a Vampire who created a sort of twisted "family" that included "daughter" (not really his daughter) [Irini Sengir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irini+Sengir), and the one and only grandmother in *Magic* (also not actually his grandmother).




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Irini%20Sengir)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irini%20Sengir)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grandmother%20Sengir)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grandmother%20Sengir)


Additionally, there are a number of cards that we know were fathers from the story, but that aren't necessarily represented as such on their cards. [Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jarad%2C+Golgari+Lich+Lord), for example, had a son named Myc. Jared actually became a lich because he died saving his son from a Rakdos ritual. The other side of the father coin is [Konda, Lord of Eiganjo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%2C+Lord+of+Eiganjo), who was the father of [Michiko Konda, Truth Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Michiko+Konda%2C+Truth+Seeker), both represented on cards. Michiko eventually teamed up with [Toshiro Umezawa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toshiro+Umezawa) (who we also know became a father, as he is ancestor to [Tetsuo Umezawa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tetsuo+Umezawa)) to take down her father. So, you know, they had issues.


Also, *Magic* includes a nutty extended family, including a wacky aunt and uncle duo.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mad%20Auntie)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad%20Auntie)


For the record, there are also no cards named "grandfather" in *Magic*, but that doesn't mean they've been forgotten.
