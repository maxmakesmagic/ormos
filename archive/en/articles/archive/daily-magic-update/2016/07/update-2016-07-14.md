The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 14, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by the *Magic: The Gathering* Hall of Fame. [It's voting season](#item2), so get ready to see nothing but tweets about who people are voting for, what criteria is best/stupid, and how some people are trying to game the system.


Today's Must
============


1. [*Eldritch Moon* Set Review: Commons and Uncommons](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-345-eldritch-moon-set-review-commons-and-uncommons/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Owen Turtenwald

Just in time for your Prerelease and clocking in at a scant 5 hours, 3 minutes, and 47 seconds (but they're an important 47 seconds)—your Limited Resources commons and uncommons review! If you want to be prepared for diving into *Eldritch Moon* Limited—and we mean really prepared, like, take the afternoon off and draw yourself a bath prepared—then Marshall and Owen have tons of content ready for you.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Voting for two people for this year's [#mtghof](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtghof?src=hash) - Yuuya and Owen
> 
> 
>  — Paulo Vitor (@PVDDR) [July 14, 2016](https://twitter.com/PVDDR/status/753415414827327488)

It's Hall of Fame voting season! Yuuya Watanabe and Owen Turtenwald are the frontrunners, but there are [plenty of other people](https://twitter.com/Gfabs5/status/753422304718249984) garnering support. Follow the conversation on Twitter at [#MTGHOF](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtghof?src=hash)—and believe me, this will garner plenty of conversation. And articles. And arguments. And counterarguments...


1. [Where's The Professor?](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4spenl/wheres_the_professor/)

Remember the old Where's Waldo books? Of course you do. I did one like three weeks ago (Wizard, how did you lose your staff?!). Well, someone on Reddit posted an image asking you to find The Professor [in a Grand Prix crowd](http://imgur.com/7JZKPVB). And when one person did, another Redditor photoshopped The Professor into [another image](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4spqod/wheres_the_professor_2/) with the same challenge. Here's hoping this becomes a thing.


So You're Going to a Prerelease?
================================


1. Sameer Merchant does the good work | MTGGoldfish

Sameer Merchant is like a spreadsheet-providing angel when it comes time for Prereleases, and this time he has two handy references for your studying needs. First up, [*Eldritch Moon* Instant-Speed Tricks](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/eldritch-moon-instant-speed-tricks), an article featuring all of the, um, instant-speed tricks from the latest set. Some things are just self-explanatory. For example, his second article, [*Eldritch Moon* Removal](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/eldritch-moon-removal) which details (with emphasis on details)—well, you know.


1. [*Eldritch Moon* with Sam Stoddard](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Nate Burgess, and Sean Whatson

Sam Stoddard, the lead developer of *Eldritch Moon*, stops by the Commanderin' podcast to talk about *Urza's Saga*.


Kidding. He's obviously here to talk about *Eldritch Moon* and to provide some advice for your Prerelease. This is part one of a two-part interview.


1. [*Eldritch Moon* Release Notes](http://judgecast.com/?p=988) | JudgeCast | CJ Shrader, Bryan Prillaman, and Jess Dunks

Speaking of Prereleases, the JudgeCast crew got together and recorded a podcast about all of the new rules and stuff that came with *Eldritch Moon*. For the judge or technically minded player.


After All of That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
==================================================


1. [Top 5 *Eldritch Moon* Pauper Cards for *Magic: The Gathering*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24bAMq72Gi0) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

As The Professor's intro says, Pauper is so hot right now. I'm paraphrasing. At any rate, he covers the Top 5 Pauper cards and seems genuinely excited about them.


And while you're on his channel, you might as well also check out the [Magic the Amateuring video podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqfAvh8Pbnc) on new mechanics and interactions featuring Judge Rob.

1. [Innistrad Art Book: A Review and Interview](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/mikelinnemann-07142016-innistrad-art-book-a-review-and-interview/) | Gathering Magic | Mike Linnemann

Few people in the community care about art as much as Mike Linnemann, so it's appropriate that he grabbed an interview with one of the people behind *The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Innistrad*, James Wyatt. Anyone who loves art, Innistrad, or James Wyatt (and who doesn't love James?) should check out this interview/review.


1. [Ten Bold Predictions for *Eldritch Moon*](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33279_Ten-Bold-Predictions-for-Eldritch-Moon.html) | StarCityGames.com | Jim Davis

"Bold" may be a bit, um, bold for some of these predictions, but Jim Davis is taking a hard stance on everything from [Gisela, the Broken Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gisela%2C+the+Broken+Blade) and [Eldritch Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldritch+Evolution) being overhyped to Spirits possibly being underhyped. The word "Faeries" was used in conjunction with Spirits, so you know he's serious. Or hyperbolic. Or seriously hyperbolic.


1. [*Eldritch Moon* Commander Review](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33271_Eldritch-Moon-Commander-Review.html) | StarCityGames.com | Sheldon Menery

Always expected, never unwelcome, Sheldon "The Godfather of Commander" Menery shares his reviews of tons of *Eldritch Moon* cards for Commander. You won't find a more complete Commander review.

1. [Canadian Highlander Staples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13mMN_mKwaWaOjZhwoyYOiVtIRSZ81y0mkDRrqX0WgdM/edit#gid=0)

Alex Steacy, of LoadingReadyRun fame, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/alexsteacy/status/753414341227978752) out a link yesterday that lead to a database of staples for Canadian Highlander. Given the increased interest in the format after being featured [on Community Super League](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMf-SPes9Pc&index=52&list=PL3rP64NRtmbij-J8lvM1G4C7zSiy5D4fI), this is a pretty good starting place for anyone looking to build a deck. Though the lack of [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) on this list is disturbing.
