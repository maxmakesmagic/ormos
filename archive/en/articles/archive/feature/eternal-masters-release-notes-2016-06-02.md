The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [**Wizards.com/CustomerService**](http://www.wizards.com/CustomerService).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

GENERAL NOTES


**What is *Eternal Masters*?**


The *Eternal Masters* set showcases the history of *Magic: The Gathering* in a way you've never seen it! Featuring cards from sets as recent as *Magic Origins* and as far back as *Magic*'s very first release, *Eternal Masters* is designed to provide an exciting and unique Limited experience with cards that have never been drafted together—and some cards so powerful that they've never been reprinted before.


**Release Information**


The *Eternal Masters* set contains 249 cards (101 common, 80 uncommon, 53 rare, and 15 mythic rare).


Release date: June 10, 2016


*Magic Online* release date: June 17, 2016


Go to [**Wizards.com/Locator**](http://www.wizards.com/locator) to find an event or store near you.


**Format Legality**


The two formats known as "Eternal" formats are Vintage and Legacy. All cards in the *Eternal Masters* set are legal in the Vintage format, and most of the cards are also legal in the Legacy format. Inclusion in the *Eternal Masters* set doesn't change what other formats a card is legal in.


Go to [**Magic.Wizards.com/Rules**](http://magic.wizards.com/rules) for a complete list of formats and permitted card sets.




---

**Returning Mechanics**


All cards in the *Eternal Masters* set have previously appeared in other *Magic* sets. Accordingly, several keywords and other mechanics make their return. None of the rules regarding these mechanics have changed since they last appeared.




---

**Cascade**


Cascade is an ability that lets one spell dig into your library for another—and if you're lucky, the second spell could cascade into yet another spell. It originally appeared in *Alara Reborn*.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_PbzylUZQJk2.png)



 Bloodbraid Elf  

 {2}{R}{G}  

 Creature — Elf Berserker  

 3/2  

 Haste  

 Cascade *(When you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom in a random order.)*



* Cascade triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that the cascade ability resolves before that spell. If you choose to cast the exiled card, it will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
* When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
* You exile the cards face up. All players will be able to see them.
* If you cast the last exiled card, you're casting it as a spell. It can be countered. If that card has cascade, the new spell's cascade ability will trigger, and you'll repeat the process for the new spell.
* After you're done exiling cards and casting the last one if you chose to do so, the remaining exiled cards are randomly placed on the bottom of your library. Neither you nor any other player is allowed to know the order of those cards.
* If no card that costs less was exiled, you'll put your entire library in a random order. Though effectively you'll be shuffling your library, this does not count as shuffling for cards such as [Psychogenic Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychogenic+Probe).
* If a spell with cascade is countered, the cascade ability will still resolve normally.
* Because you're already casting the spell using an alternative cost (by casting it without paying its mana cost), you can't pay any other alternative costs for the card. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.



---

**Echo**


Echo is an ability that lets you pay for a permanent in two installments. It originally appeared in the *Urza's Saga* block, and it appeared more recently in *Modern Masters*.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_cXZc3Tu4TU.png)



 Karmic Guide  

 {3}{W}{W}  

 Creature — Angel Spirit  

 2/2  

 Flying, protection from black  

 Echo {3}{W}{W} *(At the beginning of your upkeep, if this came under your control since the beginning of your last upkeep, sacrifice it unless you pay its echo cost.)*  

 When [Karmic Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic+Guide) enters the battlefield, return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield.



* Paying for echo is always optional. When the echo triggered ability resolves, if you can't pay the echo cost, or choose not to, you sacrifice that permanent.
* Your permanent's echo ability will trigger during your upkeep if it entered the battlefield since the beginning of your last upkeep, or if you gained control of it since the beginning of your last upkeep.



---

**Flashback**


Flashback is an ability that lets you cast a spell from your graveyard. It originally appeared in the *Odyssey* block, and it appeared more recently in the *Innistrad* block.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_g95NTwPn1x.png)



 Cabal Therapy  

 {B}  

 Sorcery  

 Name a nonland card. Target player reveals his or her hand and discards all cards with that name.  

 Flashback—Sacrifice a creature. *(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)*



* You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can only cast a sorcery using flashback when you could normally cast a sorcery.
* Casting a spell using flashback doesn't change the mana cost (or converted mana cost) of the spell. You just pay the flashback cost instead.
* Effects that cause you to pay more or less when casting a spell will also affect what you pay when casting the spell using flashback.
* A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.
* You can cast a spell using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.



---

**Hybrid mana**


Hybrid mana symbols represent costs that can be paid with either of two colors of mana. For example, {B/G} can be paid with either {B} or {G}. It's both a black mana symbol and a green mana symbol.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_Q1ty4hS9yB.png)



 Deathrite Shaman  

 {B/G}  

 Creature — Elf Shaman  

 1/2  

 {T}: Exile target land card from a graveyard. Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.  

 {B}, {T}: Exile target instant or sorcery card from a graveyard. Each opponent loses 2 life.  

 {G}, {T}: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. You gain 2 life.



* You choose how you're going to pay for each hybrid mana symbol as you're casting the spell or activating the ability with a cost that includes one or more of them.
* When calculating the converted mana cost of a card, each hybrid mana symbol counts as 1.
* A card with a hybrid mana symbol in its cost is both of those colors at all times, regardless of what color mana was spent to cast it.



---

**Imprint**


Imprint is an ability word from the *Mirrodin* and *Scars of Mirrodin* blocks. It indicates abilities of permanents that exile other cards and use those cards' characteristics to determine an effect. An ability word has no rules meaning; it's simply a label tying together similar abilities.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_12GXp38VpR.png)



 Chrome Mox  

 {0}  

 Artifact  
*Imprint —* When [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) enters the battlefield, you may exile a nonartifact, nonland card from your hand.  

 {T}: Add one mana of any of the exiled card's colors to your mana pool.



* Each permanent with an imprint ability also has an ability that refers to the "exiled card(s)" or "card(s) exiled with" that permanent. These two abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards exiled as a result of the imprint ability, not by any other ability.
* A permanent with an imprint ability might not have an exiled card for its linked ability to refer to. This might happen if all cards exiled by the imprint ability have left the exile zone, if you chose not to exile a card with an optional imprint ability, or if the imprint ability failed to exile a card because it was countered, among other reasons. In such cases, the values of the exiled card called for by the linked ability are undefined. That ability has as much of its effect as possible, but may be unable to have any effect at all.
* If a permanent with an imprint ability leaves the battlefield and then returns to the battlefield, it is a new object. It has no association with any cards it exiled during its previous existence.



---

**Morbid**


Morbid is an ability word from the *Innistrad* block used to indicate an ability that's better if a creature died earlier in the turn. An ability word has no rules meaning; it's simply a label tying together similar abilities.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_GzMK0H5VUk.png)



 Tragic Slip  

 {B}  

 Instant  

 Target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.  
*Morbid —* That creature gets -13/-13 until end of turn instead if a creature died this turn.



* Morbid abilities merely check if a creature died earlier in the turn. The creature card doesn't need to still be in the graveyard.
* Token creatures can also die, going to their owner's graveyard before ceasing to exist.
* Morbid triggered abilities use an intervening "if" clause. A creature must have died earlier in the turn in order for these abilities to trigger; otherwise, they do nothing. In other words, there's no way to have the ability trigger if no creature has died that turn, even if you intend to have a creature die in response to the triggered ability.
* Morbid abilities care only whether a creature died, not how many creatures died.



---

**Protection**


Protection is an ability that appeared regularly in *Magic* sets in the past. It encompasses four different ways to render a permanent safe from other objects.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_2jnKVYlsts.png)



 Mother of Runes  

 {W}  

 Creature — Human Cleric  

 1/1  

 {T}: Target creature you control gains protection from the color of your choice until end of turn.



* If a permanent has protection from a quality, it means four things:
	1. Damage from a source with that quality that would be dealt to that permanent is prevented.
	2. Auras and Equipment with that quality can't be attached to that permanent.
	3. Creatures with that quality can't block that permanent.
	4. That permanent can't be the target of spells with that quality or abilities of sources with that quality.
* Nothing other than the specified events are prevented or illegal. A creature with protection from white is destroyed by [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), a creature with protection from black will get -5/-5 from [Havoc Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Havoc+Demon)'s ability, and a creature with protection from red can't ignore [Seismic Stomp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Stomp)'s restriction.
* A permanent gaining protection may cause a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability is countered and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.
* Some cards grant protection from "a color of your choice." You can't choose "artifact" or "colorless" this way, since those are not colors.



---

**Retrace**


Retrace is an ability that lets you cast a spell from your graveyard—over and over again, as long as you have lands to discard. It originally appeared in *Eventide*.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_8KvEwvIcXC.png)



 Flame Jab  

 {R}  

 Sorcery  
[Flame Jab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Jab) deals 1 damage to target creature or player.  

 Retrace *(You may cast this card from your graveyard by discarding a land card in addition to paying its other costs.)*



* Casting a spell using its retrace ability works just like casting any other spell, with two exceptions: you're casting it from your graveyard rather than your hand, and you must discard a land card in addition to any other costs.
* You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For example, you can only cast a sorcery using retrace when you could normally cast a sorcery.
* When a retrace card you cast from your graveyard resolves or is countered, it's put back into your graveyard. You may use the retrace ability to cast it again.
* If the active player (the player whose turn it is) casts a spell that has retrace, that player may cast that card again after it resolves, before another player can try to remove the card from the graveyard. This is because the active player has priority after a spell resolves, and casting a spell with retrace from the graveyard moves the card onto the stack, so no one else has the chance to affect it before it leaves the graveyard.



---

**Threshold**


Threshold is an ability word from the *Odyssey* block that indicates abilities that are enabled when you have seven or more cards in your graveyard. An ability word has no rules meaning; it's simply a label tying together similar abilities.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_uV5IvLDrxG.png)



 Werebear  

 {1}{G}  

 Creature — Human Bear Druid  

 1/1  

 {T}: Add {G} to your mana pool.  
*Threshold —* [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) gets +3/+3 as long as seven or more cards are in your graveyard.





---

**Typecycling**


Typecycling allows you to discard a card to search for any card in your library that has certain characteristics. It appeared in *Scourge* and the *Shards of Alara* block in various forms, although in *Eternal Masters*, the only typecycling abilities are islandcycling and swampcycling.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_RnsV3Jp566.png)



 Twisted Abomination  

 {5}{B}  

 Creature — Zombie Mutant  

 5/3  

 {B}: Regenerate [Twisted Abomination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Abomination).  

 Swampcycling {2} *({2}, Discard this card: Search your library for a Swamp card, reveal it, and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your library.)*



* Typecycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) or [Rings of Brighthearth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rings+of+Brighthearth)) will interact with islandcycling and swampcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as [Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul) or [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)) will not.
* You can choose to find any card with the specified type, including nonbasic lands, while resolving a typecycling ability. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is such a card in your library.



---

**Vanishing**


Vanishing is an ability that limits how long a creature will remain on the battlefield. It originally appeared in *Planar Chaos*.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_vbi2o8rUTd.png)



 Calciderm  

 {2}{W}{W}  

 Creature — Beast  

 5/5  

 Shroud *(This creature can't be the target of spells or abilities.)*  

 Vanishing 4 *(This creature enters the battlefield with four time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter from it. When the last is removed, sacrifice it.)*



* If the last time counter is removed from a permanent with vanishing and the sacrifice ability is countered, that permanent will remain on the battlefield indefinitely with no time counters on it. Neither of vanishing's two triggered abilities will trigger again. Similarly, if a permanent without time counters on it becomes a copy of a permanent with vanishing, it will stay on the battlefield indefinitely. If a permanent with one or more time counters on it becomes a copy of a permanent with vanishing, it will vanish as normal.

CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES
===================


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_r0Qzn6lvxY.png)



 Abundant Growth  

 {G}  

 Enchantment — Aura  

 Enchant land  

 When [Abundant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abundant+Growth) enters the battlefield, draw a card.  

 Enchanted land has "{T}: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool."



* The enchanted land retains any other abilities it has. Activating one of the land's activated abilities won't cause the other(s) to be activated.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_i2l9j8UaYe.png)



 Animate Dead  

 {1}{B}  

 Enchantment — Aura  

 Enchant creature card in a graveyard  

 When [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) enters the battlefield, if it's on the battlefield, it loses "enchant creature card in a graveyard" and gains "enchant creature put onto the battlefield with [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead)." Return enchanted creature card to the battlefield under your control and attach [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) to it. When [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it.  

 Enchanted creature gets -1/-0.



* [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) is an Aura, albeit with an unusual enchant ability. You target a creature card in a graveyard when you cast it. It enters the battlefield attached to that card. Then it returns that card to the battlefield, and attaches itself to the card again (since the card is a new object on the battlefield). [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) itself never moves into a graveyard during this process.
* If [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) isn't on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves, none of its effects happen. The creature card won't be returned to the battlefield.
* Abilities such as shroud and protection function only on the battlefield unless otherwise specified. A creature card with shroud may be targeted by [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead), and [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) will become attached to the creature that enters the battlefield.
* If the creature put onto the battlefield has protection from black—or if the creature can't legally be enchanted by [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) for another reason—[Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) won't be able to attach to it. It will be put into the graveyard as a state-based action, causing its delayed triggered ability to trigger. When the trigger resolves, if the creature's still on the battlefield, its controller will sacrifice it.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_WKjPbgjNdg.png)



 Annihilate  

 {3}{B}{B}  

 Instant  

 Destroy target nonblack creature. It can't be regenerated.  

 Draw a card.



* If the targeted creature is an illegal target when [Annihilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annihilate) tries to resolve, the entire spell is countered. You won't draw a card.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_cLiBKxwVR6.png)



 Arcanis the Omnipotent  

 {3}{U}{U}{U}  

 Legendary Creature — Wizard  

 3/4  

 {T}: Draw three cards.  

 {2}{U}{U}: Return [Arcanis the Omnipotent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcanis+the+Omnipotent) to its owner's hand.



* Arcanis's last ability can only be activated while it's on the battlefield.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_cTE1L8qDKE.png)



 Argothian Enchantress  

 {1}{G}  

 Creature — Human Druid  

 0/1  

 Shroud *(This creature can't be the target of spells or abilities.)*  

 Whenever you cast an enchantment spell, draw a card.



* [Argothian Enchantress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argothian+Enchantress)'s last ability will resolve before the spell that caused it to trigger.
* If the enchantment spell is countered, [Argothian Enchantress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argothian+Enchantress)'s last ability still resolves and causes you to draw a card.
* Enchantments put onto the battlefield without being cast won't cause [Argothian Enchantress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argothian+Enchantress)'s last ability to trigger.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_jWICJU4lCC.png)



 Armadillo Cloak  

 {1}{G}{W}  

 Enchantment — Aura  

 Enchant creature  

 Enchanted creature gets +2/+2 and has trample.  

 Whenever enchanted creature deals damage, you gain that much life.



* While [Armadillo Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armadillo+Cloak)'s last ability is similar to lifelink, it isn't lifelink—it's a normal triggered ability. If a creature you control with lifelink wears an [Armadillo Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armadillo+Cloak) and deals damage, first you'll gain that much life for lifelink, and then [Armadillo Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armadillo+Cloak)'s triggered ability is put onto the stack. This also means that multiple instances of [Armadillo Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armadillo+Cloak)'s triggered ability do trigger separately.
* If [Armadillo Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armadillo+Cloak) enchants a creature you don't control, you'll gain life when it deals damage, as long as that damage hasn't already caused you to lose the game.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_H5wUclVmHl.png)



 Balance  

 {1}{W}  

 Sorcery  

 Each player chooses a number of lands he or she controls equal to the number of lands controlled by the player who controls the fewest, then sacrifices the rest. Players discard cards and sacrifice creatures the same way.



* First the player whose turn it is chooses which lands (if any) to keep, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by the players who chose before them. All of the unchosen lands are then sacrificed simultaneously. Then the process is repeated for cards in hand, except that no cards are revealed until all players have chosen what to discard, at which point those cards are all discarded simultaneously. Lastly, the process is repeated for creatures, and players will again know earlier choices made when deciding what to sacrifice. All of the unchosen creatures are then sacrificed simultaneously.
* [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance) doesn't have targets, so permanents that can't be targeted, such as a creature with shroud or protection from white, are valid choices to be sacrificed.
* Each type of object is counted during the corresponding part of the process. Cards in hand are counted after lands have been sacrificed, and creatures on the battlefield are counted after cards have been discarded. Thus, a land creature sacrificed to the first part of the spell would not be counted when determining how many creatures are on the battlefield for the last part.

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_Oop4pgIrLx.png)



 Battle Squadron  

 {3}{R}{R}  

 Creature — Goblin  

 \*/\*  

 Flying  
[Battle Squadron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Squadron)'s power and toughness are each equal to the number of creatures you control.



* [Battle Squadron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Squadron)'s last ability applies in all zones. While it's on the battlefield, it counts itself, so it'll be at least 1/1.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_YHMmSHurCV.png)



 Blood Artist  

 {1}{B}  

 Creature — Vampire  

 0/1  

 Whenever [Blood Artist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist) or another creature dies, target player loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.



* If [Blood Artist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist) and one or more other creatures die at the same time, its ability will trigger for each of those creatures.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_jzXhZZB5VZ.png)



 Brago, King Eternal  

 {2}{W}{U}  

 Legendary Creature — Spirit  

 2/4  

 Flying  

 Whenever [Brago, King Eternal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brago%2C+King+Eternal) deals combat damage to a player, exile any number of target nonland permanents you control, then return those cards to the battlefield under their owner's control.



* Brago's last ability exiles and returns all the targets during the combat damage step, after combat damage is dealt. You can't target any creature that didn't survive combat.
* You may exile and return Brago using its own ability.
* If you exile an Aura with Brago's last ability, the Aura's owner chooses what it will enchant as it comes back onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything (so it could be attached to a permanent with shroud, for example), but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. The Aura can't enter the battlefield enchanting a permanent that enters the battlefield at the same time. If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it remains exiled.

* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keywords are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. Triggered abilities (written with "when," "whenever," or "at") don't have to target a Flagbearer.

 +1: Target player draws two cards, then discards two cards.

* The ability of Dack's emblem will resolve before the spell that caused it to trigger.

 Flash  

 When [Dualcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dualcaster+Mage) enters the battlefield, copy target instant or sorcery spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.



* [Dualcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dualcaster+Mage)'s triggered ability can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
* As [Dualcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dualcaster+Mage)'s triggered ability resolves, it creates a copy of a spell on the stack. The copy isn't cast, so abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs paid for the targeted spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
* If the spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* If the spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) does), the copy has the same value of X.
* If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.

It's still a [Shapeshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapeshifter).



* If no creature card is imprinted on [Duplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant), it has its normal power, toughness, and creature type.
* [Duplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant)'s base power and toughness change to the imprinted card's power and toughness. Counters and other effects that modify [Duplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant)'s power and toughness still apply.
* Abilities that define a creature's power and toughness apply while that card is in exile, but abilities that add or subtract from it don't. For example, the ability of [Battle Squadron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Squadron) applies to determine [Duplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant)'s power and toughness, but the ability of [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) doesn't. [Duplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant)'s power and toughness are constantly updated if the exiled card's power and/or toughness change.
* [Duplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant) keeps all creature types it had when the card was imprinted, including any types that [Duplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant) had gained.

* The ability only checks if you control no other creatures at the time it triggers. It does not check again on resolution, so gaining control of a creature before then will not save [Emperor Crocodile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emperor+Crocodile).

* If the top card of your library is a land, you may play that land only if you have any available land plays.
* If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability (perhaps because that top card is the card you're casting) the new top card won't be revealed until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability.
* As soon as you finish playing the card on top of your library, reveal the next card in your library.

 Gaea's Blessing  

 {1}{G}  

 Sorcery  

 Target player shuffles up to three target cards from his or her graveyard into his or her library.  

 Draw a card.  

 When [Gaea's Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Blessing) is put into your graveyard from your library, shuffle your graveyard into your library.



* When you cast [Gaea's Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Blessing), you can't choose it as one of its own targets. This is because you choose the targets when casting this spell, and spells are not put into your graveyard until after they resolve.
* You must target a player as you cast [Gaea's Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Blessing). You may target zero, one, two, or three cards in that player's graveyard.

 3/3  

 Vigilance  

 When [Glimmerpoint Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpoint+Stag) enters the battlefield, exile another target permanent. Return that card to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step.



* If a token is exiled this way, it ceases to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
* The exiled card will return to the battlefield at the beginning of the next end step even if [Glimmerpoint Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpoint+Stag) is no longer on the battlefield at that time.
* If the exiled card is an Aura, that card's owner chooses what it will enchant as it comes back onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything (so it could be attached to a permanent with shroud, for example), but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it remains exiled.
* If [Glimmerpoint Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpoint+Stag) somehow enters the battlefield during a turn's end step, the exiled card won't be returned to the battlefield until the beginning of the following turn's end step.

 {3}, {T}: Reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a land card. [Goblin Charbelcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher) deals damage equal to the number of nonland cards revealed this way to target creature or player. If the revealed land card was a Mountain, [Goblin Charbelcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher) deals double that damage instead. Put the revealed cards on the bottom of your library in any order.



* You must choose a target for [Goblin Charbelcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher)'s ability as you activate it, before you reveal any cards.
* If you reveal no land cards, [Goblin Charbelcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher) deals damage equal to the number of cards revealed, and then you may order your library as you like.

 Green Sun's Zenith

 Search your library for a green creature card with converted mana cost X or less, put it onto the battlefield, then shuffle your library. Shuffle [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) into its owner's library.



* If [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) is countered, none of its effects will happen. Notably, it will be put into its owner's graveyard rather than shuffled into its owner's library.
* In most cases, if you own [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) and cast it, you'll shuffle your library twice. In practice, shuffling once is sufficient, but effects that care about you shuffling your library (like [Psychogenic Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychogenic+Probe), for example) will see that you've shuffled twice.
* If you own [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith), but an opponent casts it (due to [Knowledge Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knowledge+Pool)'s effect, for example), that opponent searches his or her library for an appropriate creature card, then shuffles that library. That opponent then shuffles [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) into your library. You won't shuffle any library in this case.

Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after [Humble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humble) resolves will overwrite this effect.
* Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of [Seal of Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Strength), will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.
* If the affected creature gains an ability after [Humble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humble) resolves, it will keep that ability.
* [Humble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humble) doesn't counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated.

 {2}, {T}: You may copy the exiled card. If you do, you may cast the copy without paying its mana cost.



* If the imprinted card leaves the exile zone while the activated ability is on the stack, the copy can't be made.
* If [Isochron Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) leaves the battlefield while the activated ability is on the stack, the ability can still make a copy.
* You cast the copy while the ability is resolving and still on the stack.
* Because you're already casting the spell using an alternative cost (by casting it without paying its mana cost), you can't pay any other alternative costs for the card. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the exiled card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value for X when casting it.
* You may exile a split card while resolving [Isochron Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter)'s imprint ability if either half has a converted mana cost of 2 or less. When you activate the second ability, you may choose to cast either half of the split card, even if one half has a converted mana cost greater than 2, but you may not cast both halves.

[Phyrexian Ingester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Ingester) gets +X/+Y, where X is the exiled creature card's power and Y is its toughness.



* [Phyrexian Ingester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Ingester) will get bonuses based on the card's power and toughness in exile. Counters, Auras, and Equipment it had on it before it was exiled won't add to those numbers.
* Abilities that define a creature's power and toughness apply while that card is in exile, but abilities that add or subtract from it don't. For example, the ability of [Battle Squadron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Squadron) applies to determine [Phyrexian Ingester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Ingester)'s power and toughness, but the ability of [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) doesn't. [Phyrexian Ingester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Ingester)'s power and toughness are constantly updated if the exiled card's power and/or toughness change.
* If the card in exile isn't a creature card (perhaps because it was a land that was temporarily a creature while on the battlefield), [Phyrexian Ingester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Ingester) doesn't get a bonus.

 At the beginning of your draw step, you may draw two additional cards. If you do, choose two cards in your hand drawn this turn. For each of those cards, pay 4 life or put the card on top of your library.
 


* You always perform your normal draw before this ability. The normal draw occurs before anything can be placed on the stack during a player's draw step.
* If you control other triggered abilities that allow you to draw cards during your draw step, you can choose to order [Sylvan Library](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library)'s ability before or after those abilities. Triggered abilities controlled by other players will resolve before triggered abilities you control.
* Any cards drawn prior to [Sylvan Library](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library)'s ability resolving, including in your upkeep or in response to [Sylvan Library](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library)'s triggered ability, can be chosen to be put back using this effect. [Sylvan Library](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library)'s controller is responsible for keeping these cards distinguishable in hand, such as by keeping them separate from cards that began the turn in hand.
* If you control more than one [Sylvan Library](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library), the triggered ability of each will resolve in sequence. You don't get to draw all the cards at once and then put them all back at once.
* You can put back zero, one, or two cards.
* If you choose to draw two cards, then replace one or more of those draws with some other effect, the rest of [Sylvan Library](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library)'s ability still happens. If you've actually drawn only one card that turn, you must choose that card and either pay 4 life or put it on top of your library. If you haven't actually drawn any cards that turn, the rest of the ability has no effect.
* It's not possible to take any actions between drawing the cards and choosing two cards. You can't cast the cards you drew to avoid having two cards to choose.

* [Torrent of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Souls) cares about what mana was spent to pay its total cost, not just what mana was spent to pay the hybrid mana symbol in its cost.
* [Torrent of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Souls) checks on resolution to see if any black or red mana was spent to pay its cost. It doesn't matter how much mana of that color was spent; you won't return more than one creature, and creatures the targeted player controls won't get more than +2/+0.
* The effects of the spell happen in order. If you spent both {B} and {R} to cast [Torrent of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Souls), first you'll return a creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield, then all creatures the targeted player controls—including the one you just returned if that player is you—will get +2/+0 and gain haste until end of turn.
* If [Torrent of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Souls) is copied, the copy will not have had black or red mana paid for it, no matter what colors were spent on the original spell.

* If you cast [Toxic Deluge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toxic+Deluge) without paying its mana cost, you'll still choose a value for X and pay X life. This is because it doesn't have {X} in its mana cost.

 Choose two target creature cards in your graveyard. Sacrifice a creature. If you do, return the chosen cards to the battlefield tapped.



* You must choose two targets. You can't cast [Victimize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Victimize) targeting only one creature card.
* The creature you sacrifice isn't chosen until [Victimize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Victimize) resolves. You can't return the creature you sacrifice because it will still be on the battlefield at the time targets are chosen.
* As [Victimize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Victimize) resolves, you must sacrifice a creature if able. You can't change your mind and choose not to sacrifice anything.
* If one of the targeted creature cards is an illegal target (for instance, because it has left your graveyard before [Victimize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Victimize) resolves), you'll still sacrifice a creature and put the other card onto the battlefield. If both are illegal targets, [Victimize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Victimize) will be countered. You won't sacrifice a creature.

 Void  

 {3}{B}{R}  

 Sorcery  

 Choose a number. Destroy all artifacts and creatures with converted mana cost equal to that number. Then target player reveals his or her hand and discards all nonland cards with converted mana cost equal to the number.
 


* You can choose 0. Artifact lands and most tokens have converted mana costs of 0, for example.
* The target player is chosen as you announce Void, but the number isn't chosen until it's resolving. No player may choose to take actions between you choosing a number and the rest of Void's effects.

 Warden of Evos Isle  

 {2}{U}  

 Creature — Bird Wizard  

 2/2  

 Flying  

 Creature spells with flying you cast cost {1} less to cast.



* A creature spell that doesn't have flying won't cost less even if the creature it will become will have flying once on the battlefield. For example, if you control an Island and [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) is in your graveyard, creature spells won't cost {1} less even though those creatures will have flying once they're on the battlefield.
* The ability can't reduce the colored mana requirement of a creature spell with flying.

 Whitemane Lion  

 {1}{W}  

 Creature — Cat  

 2/2  

 Flash  

 When [Whitemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitemane+Lion) enters the battlefield, return a creature you control to its owner's hand.



* You may return [Whitemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitemane+Lion) itself to its owner's hand as its triggered ability resolves. If you control no other creatures, you must return it.
* The ability doesn't target any creature. You don't choose what to return until the ability resolves. Once the ability has started to resolve, no one can respond to the choice.

 Winter Orb  

 {2}  

 Artifact  

 As long as [Winter Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter+Orb) is untapped, players can't untap more than one land during their untap steps.



* All permanents untap during a player's untap step at once. If [Winter Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter+Orb) is tapped as your untap step begins, your lands will all untap.
* You can't tap [Winter Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter+Orb) just because you want to. Another ability, such as that of [Glare of Subdual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual), must instruct or allow you to do so.

 Worldgorger Dragon  

 {3}{R}{R}{R}  

 Creature — Nightmare Dragon  

 7/7  

 Flying, trample  

 When [Worldgorger Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldgorger+Dragon) enters the battlefield, exile all other permanents you control.  

 When [Worldgorger Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldgorger+Dragon) leaves the battlefield, return the exiled cards to the battlefield under their owners' control.



* It is possible for [Worldgorger Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldgorger+Dragon) to leave the battlefield before its "enters the battlefield" trigger resolves. If this happens, then the "leaves the battlefield" trigger will have nothing to return. Then its "enters the battlefield" trigger resolves, and all other permanents you control are exiled forever.
* If an Aura is exiled with [Worldgorger Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldgorger+Dragon), the player who controls the Aura when it enters the battlefield chooses what it will enchant. It doesn't have to go back to the same place. It can't enter the battlefield enchanting a permanent that enters the battlefield at the same time.
* If [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) is put onto the battlefield enchanting [Worldgorger Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldgorger+Dragon), [Worldgorger Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldgorger+Dragon)'s enters-the-battlefield trigger will exile [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead), which causes you to sacrifice [Worldgorger Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldgorger+Dragon), which causes [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) to return to the battlefield attached to a creature card in a graveyard of your choice. If you can choose a creature card other than [Worldgorger Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldgorger+Dragon), you must do so after as many iterations of this loop as you'd like. If you can't choose a different card, and no player chooses to break the loop, the game ends in a draw.
