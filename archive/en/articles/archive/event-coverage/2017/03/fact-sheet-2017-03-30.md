The main tournament at Grand Prix San Antonio is open to *Magic* players of all ages.


Players must have a signed waiver and consent form to compete at Grand Prix San Antonio. Forms can be [downloaded here](http://media.wizards.com/2016/docs/MTG_GP_Waiver_2017.pdf) and will be available on-site. Minors must have a parent of guardian’s signature on these forms. Minors will not be able to register or play unless we receive a waiver signed by a parent or guardian. No exceptions.




* Team [Modern Constructed](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/modern)
* Players should review the [*Magic* Tournament Rules](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules) for the rules specific to Team Tournaments, paying particular attention to the following sections:
	+ Section 8.2 — Team Composition and Identification
	+ Section 8.3 — Team Communication
* Unified Deck Construction Rules  

 Team Constructed tournaments use Unified Deck Construction rules: Except for cards with the basic supertype or cards with text that specifies otherwise, no two decks on a team may contain the same card, based on its English card title. (For example, if one player is using [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) in a Team Constructed tournament, no other player on that team may use [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) in his or her deck.) No players may use cards that are banned in a particular format.
* Deck lists are required
* Players must use the same deck on Day Two that they used on Day One.


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 5 Swiss rounds and the Top 4 single-elimination playoff.
* All teams with an X-3-0 record (or better) or the top 40 teams – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 4 teams after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff.
* Top 4 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3 per individual match, with no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Only 1 round will be played in the semi-finals and finals.
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the playoff, the players on the team that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 4 playoff match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
