We're into June, and only two months of the season remain. Let's take a look at the latest **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings as we head down the summer stretch. Despite two Grand Prix last weekend, it was a quiet week for the Top 25, with no movement above Lee Shi Tian at No. 16, and no new entries, meaning Kentaro Yamamoto of Japan stays on the leaderboard at No. 25. 

 That's not to say that there wasn't plenty of action, though. In Brazil, [Grand Prix São Paulo](/en/events/coverage/gods-have-spoken-s%C3%A3o-paulo) featured Team Limited, and that allowed No. 24 Willy Edel the chance to play with longtime Pro Tour competitor Allison Abe and Hall of Famer Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa. By most measures, 28th out of 315 teams would be success, but it wasn't enough to gain Edel any Pro Points. 

 In Europe, meanwhile, [Manchester](/en/events/coverage/anteri-strikes-gold-manchester) was the venue for the lone global Grand Prix to follow the Block Constructed [Pro Tour Journey Into Nyx](/en/events/coverage/ptjour14) format. At an event brilliantly supported by an energetic UK **Magic** community, World Champion Shahar Shenhar and Josh McClain was the ranked pair looking to improve their standings. Shenhar fell by the wayside on Day One, while McClain battled throughout Day Two, eventually finishing 60th. That was good enough for $300, but with five excellent Grand Prix performances already in the books this season, it wasn't enough for extra points. 

 One interesting footnote from the weekend was the number of Pros who are already turning their thoughts toward Pro Tour ***Magic** 2015* at Portland. Still close to two months away, the grand finale to the season is going to be the clincher or heartbreaker for dozens of players as they fight for Platinum, Gold, and Silver Player Club levels, World **Magic** Cup captaincy, and—for the true elite—a seat at the World Championship. 

 We'll be back next week to take another look at the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings.
