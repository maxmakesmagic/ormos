Round 10 Feature Match: Reveling in Sideboard Tech – Robert van Medevoort vs Nicolay Potovin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

For the first round in day two, we have Robert van Medevoort against Nicolay Potovin. Having had another great nationals this year, van Medevoort must be very happy about the changes to the Pro Tour structure. He had had a good day on Saturday as well, advancing to a 64 man day two where he was virtually assured money. His opponent for the round, Nicolay Potovin, first really broke onto the scene with a limited GP win last year in Gothenberg. Since then, Potovin and his red Russian football shirt have been a fixture on the Pro Tour.


On the play Nicolay had a [Secluded Glen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secluded+Glen) tapped, while Robert led with a suspended [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon). From just the first turn it was clear that we had a Faeries matchup against the combo version of the [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) deck.


Having missed [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s on turn one, Potovin did have [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom), while van Medevoort, a current member of the Dutch national team (again), had Coldsteel Heart and a swift [Aven Riftwatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher). The Dutchy tried for [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), only to have it countered by [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), bouncing Coldsteel Heart.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop08/Nicolay-Potovin.jpg)A [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) from van Medevoort also met a [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), while Potovin continued to amass an army of Faerie Rogues, each of whom was represented by a Raphael Levy Pro Player card. He brought a [Murderous Redcap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) to join his team, wholeheartedly attacking his opponent’s life total, which was going up and down erratically thanks to that [Aven Riftwatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher). [Murderous Redcap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) is an interesting addition to Faeries, that has become maindeckable since red decks with [Magus of the Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon) have started dominating the format.


Potovin suspended an [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s and passed with plenty of lands untapped. He had a [Spellstutter Sprite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) ready to stop a [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) from his opponent, and seemed in total control of what should be a favourable matchup for his Faeries deck. He swung the following turn, and had a [Murderous Redcap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) with which to deal the final points.


Robert van Medevoort 0 – 1 Nicolay Potovin


Nicolay had the [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s, but not the [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) for the perfect Faeries start in Game 2. He didn’t seem concerned though, as neither player did much more than play lands before the fourth turn, where a [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon) got suspended by von Medevoort.


The [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s from Potovin was effectively stopped by [Venser, Shaper Savant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant). Potovin snuck down a [Spellstutter Sprite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite), but couldn’t counter the wizard. What he could do was effectively champion the small Faerie with [Mistbind Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique), to effectively Time Walk. On his own turn, he played a [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), seeing a pair of copies of Wrath of God, along with a [Body Double](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double). After a little thought he took the creature, before playing a [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom), and attacking.


Robert tried to evoke a [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), but found that Remove Soul was the perfect answer to his card drawing. In a little trouble, he sacrificed his lone Venser to [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon), then played Wrath of God, killing off [Mistbind Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) and leaving [Spellstutter Sprite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) in its place.


At this point, Nicolay went on the offensive. He had a [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) to aid in attacks, and a pair of [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s to suspend. He passed the turn with just one card in hand.


Van Medevoort saw his window. A fortunate draw had brought him a [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), which resolved successfully. He demonstrated his combo to Potovin, sacrificing [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) to [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon) to get back [Body Double](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) and [Venser, Shaper Savant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant), with the [Body Double](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) copying [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark). Each time this loop was repeated, van Medevoort would be able to bounce on of his opponent’s permanents. At some point he’d be able to draw a lot of cards with [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter). On top of each of these things, at the end of it, he’d also have a [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon) to attack with! This was more than enough to get Potovin to scoop up his cards.


Robert van Medevoort 1 – 1 Nicolay Potovin


Each player carefully looked away from their opponent’s deck as they performed shuffles, and graciously wished the other good luck for the final game in the match. The hall, which had been so busy just the day before, had yet to fill up, and things were quiet as Potovin took a mulligan having looked at his seven.


“No business spells” remarked the Russian tersely. With van Medevoort playing the combo version of [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), Potovin had to ensure that he had an adequate defence against a kill that could come seemingly from nowhere.


It was with a small smirk that he threw away his 6 card hand. While the previous hand had been a judgement call, the lone [Pendelhaven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven) in hand two was definitely not good enough.


Nicolay eventually took his five card hand, and was frustrated to miss land drops two and three, having to catch up on turn four with his [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom). By this time there was already an [Aven Riftwatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher) in play from van Medevoort, and he followed up with a [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon) suspend and an evoked [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), which he got extra value from by sacrificing it to the Gargadon.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop08/Robert-van-Medevoort.jpg)Van Medevoort tried a [Body Double](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double), with just a [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) as a target in his graveyard, but it was hit by a Rune Snag from Potovin. The Russian now had lands, but his stilted start had given the Dutchy the sort of time that would make the game a lot tougher for him. Van Medevoort resolved a [Careful Consideration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration) at the end of Potovin’s turn, discarding 3 mana sources. In his upkeep, he saw a [Mistbind Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) from Potovin, who was keen to win some of his lost turns back. Robert floated mana and played [Venser, Shaper Savant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant) to bounce [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom), but otherwise passed.


Attacks from Potovin made the life totals 15 to 13 in van Medevoort’s favour. Robert struck back with Venser, and tried a [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), only to see it stopped by [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). He suspended a second [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon) and passed.


The race was on now, as Potovin’s [Mistbind Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) proved a legitimate threat on the board. It swung in along with another Faerie Rogue, knocking Robert down to 10. Potovin then played [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) once more. It was at this point that Robert unleashed his tech for the Faerie’s matchup – [Sacred Mesa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Mesa)!


With a lot of mana up, Van Medevoort could easily create a wall of flying blockers for Potovin’s team, and let Potovin’s own [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) do his work for him. Potovin thought very hard. He countered with [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) and drew a card, but saw a [Glen Elendra Archmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glen+Elendra+Archmage) come out from Robert once he was tapped out. Now, if Robert went for his combo, Nicolay would need either [Spellstutter Sprite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) or a lot of other counters to get by.


“I think you’ve won this game anyways” remarked Nicolay as he disconsolately played [Oona, Queen of the Fae](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%2C+Queen+of+the+Fae).


Robert flashed a [Body Double](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) which was the last piece of his combo. He briefly confirmed the amount of trouble that Nicolay was in, and the Russian scooped up his cards.


Robert van Medevoort 2 – 1 Nicolay Potovin

Deck Tech from Copenhagen
-------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

Going around the day 2 tables today, there were a number of decks that caught my eye, either as re-imaginings of something that we've seen before in Standard, or as something a little new. Below are three lists that it might be worth thinking about either if you have your own national championships coming up, or simply if you are looking for a change for Friday Night Magic

Stan van der Velden's take on Tarmo/Rack is pretty interesting. This is a deck that saw some play prior to Lorwyn, but that hasn't really been putting up any big numbers since. With the release of Eventide, and another quality discard spell in [Raven's Crime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raven%27s+Crime), Stan found a hole in the metagame that he managed to ride to an 8-1 finish on day one. [Sudden Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Death) is perfectly placed right now against the metagame. It kills [Swans of Bryn Argoll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swans+of+Bryn+Argoll) as necessary, can get [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) before it becomes huge, and is an unstoppable answer to [Mistbind Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) and similar from control. On top of that, all three decks can have trouble against the sheer volume of dedicated discard that this deck runs. Stan is confident about his chances of top 8 today with the deck, which is enough to warrant further investigation.

At first glance, this list from Gabriel Nassif appears to be [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark). Indeed, it is still listed as [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) within our Metagame breakdown. There are some big differences here though that make the deck perform in a rather different fashion. Firstly, check out the number of counterspells. These alone make the deck feel more like a full on control deck than regular [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark). On top of this, the addition of Boomerang to the mix creates a critical mass of bounce that gives this build more ability to play the tempo game than is typical of the archetype. There are definitely games where Nassif speaks of going 'aggro' with the deck, playing the bounce game against control and just getting stuck in before they can really get enough lands on the board to play their regular game.

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shivan+Reef)


















This blue/white control deck from Kenny Oberg of Sweden feels like a classic control deck, the like of which we haven't really seen in this format (thanks for that Red... love your work). Back in the day, Brian Weissman would counter a bunch of your spells, then throw down a massive threat, and protect it for long enough to kill you. In many respects this is what Kenny is doing with his deck, which sports plenty of counterspells, and their best friends, Teferi and [Mystical Teachings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings). In terms of his colossal threats, he has Platinum Angel (which has great synergy with his Pacts) and [Oona, Queen of the Fae](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%2C+Queen+of+the+Fae), with even more monsters in the board for every occasion.


The interesting thing about this deck is where it has chosen to splash. With [Mystical Teachings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings), it's a no brainer to have access to a little black mana for both the flashback, and for [Slaughter Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact). More interesting, perhaps is Pyroclasm in the main. We saw a similar use of the card in Quentin Martin's control deck in UK Nationals. Where Pyroclasm shines is that it kills off more or less every creature that, for example, [Firespout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout) does, but it also succeeds where the hybrid spell fails – it can kill off [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) that has come down on turn one, before it gets large and in charge and starts dominating the game. Good plan.

Round 12 Feature Match: Still undefeated? – Tomoharu Saito vs Grgur Petric Maretic
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Daniel Ullenius*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop08/Grgur.jpg)The Croatian stallwart Grgur Petric Maretic and his Fairys was facing the awesome Tomoharu Saito of Japan and his winning red deck for the feature match of round 12.


Tomoharu Saito led off this tight matchup with a [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny), a [Blood Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight), and a [Magus of the Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon) on consecutive turns. His opponent had a [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) for defense, but no round 3 play, which might or might not be the Magus’ fault.


Saito pondered his next move as his opponent had an untapped [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and decieded to barge in with only the [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) and the very bloodthirsty [Blood Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight). A fairy blocked the figure who became a 2/2, and Saito passed the turn. However, in his opponents upkeep, satio made the Figure into a dominating 4/4 (before his opponent could draw a [Nameless Inversion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Inversion), perhaps). Grgur drew and passed with a swamp on play, and Saito slapped himself, ensuring that he didn’t lose focus as he careered towards another top 8.


Life totals were 20 to Saito versus 12 for Grgur, and Satio decided to charge with the team, who met a [Mistbind Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique). The Clique was hit by a [Flame Javelin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin) in a soft spot before it could block. A 1/1 fairy token blocked the [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) and a [Slaughter Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact) took out the [Magus of the Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon), putting it’s owner back into the match.


Grgur played untapped [Secluded Glen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secluded+Glen) and showed off an [Oona, Queen of the Fae](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%2C+Queen+of+the+Fae). Saito attacked and a poor token blocked the Figure. After combat, Saito tried to make a [Ashenmoor Gouger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashenmoor+Gouger) who got Rune Snagged. Saito however payed up and played a nice, old-school [Magus of the Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Scroll).


Grgur went down to 6 from his [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom), and passed with 3 cards in hand. Saito had the mana to make the Figure into an Avatar, but in the upkeep, his opponent tapped Saito out with a very [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). Saito drew and played a Demigod who got snagged.


Grgur’s life was dropping fast, but that did not stop him from attacking with [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and a token. In his second mainphase, he [Damnation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation)ed away his own [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), making him shrug. A mistake perhaps? Saito played land, did some thinking, and passed. Grgur went to 4 from his [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom), and played an unexpected Loxodon warhammer, which made Saito flinch a bit. Saito pinged away the Fairy token with his [Keldon Megaliths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Megaliths) and played a very, very dangerous [Magus of the Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Scroll). Grgur made a [Oona, Queen of the Fae](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%2C+Queen+of+the+Fae), and Saito could take him to 3 with Megaliths, and to 0 with [Magus of the Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Scroll).


Saito 1 – Grgur Petric Maretic 0


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop08/saito.jpg)Grgur led off with a mulligan while Saito thoroughly inspected his opening seven, which he decided to keep.


Saito had the first play with a [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny), while his opponent had a very unusual round two [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom). The Figure charged in for 2 and in his upkeep Grgur went to 17. Saito attacked with the [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) and played a massive [Ashenmoor Gouger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashenmoor+Gouger), who ended up on top of his library thanks to [Consign to Dream](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consign+to+Dream). Grgur was very busy and played a lifelinking Loxodon Warhammer and suspended a [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision), putting him down to 0 untapped lands, 1 card in hand and 14 life to defend. Saito used this and attacked. No blocks from Grgur put Saito into thinking mode, but in the end he decieded to let the figure deal 2 points of damage and replayed the [Ashenmoor Gouger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashenmoor+Gouger).


Grgur made a 2/2 Changeling of his Mutavalt and attacked for 6 with a token equipped with a Loxodon warhammer and the vault. Saito played like a man and took the damage, only to return the favour by charging into the red zone with his team, which gave double block on [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) from Grgur. Saito’s Gouger connected and put his opponent to 14 again, while an Incinerate from Saito made sure that no 4-power flier with Lifelink would attack him the next turn. Grgur took a shot in the dark and tried to animate his [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and equpping it with the Loxodon Warhammer, which met a Skred from Saito.


An [Ashenmoor Gouger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashenmoor+Gouger) took Grgur to 6, and Saito made a second Gouger. The trap was closing on Grgur, who was slowly succumbing to his own [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom). A [Damnation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) from Grugr at least cleared the board, but when an enomormous [Demigod of Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) did it’s thing, it’s not much you can do.


Tomoharu Saito 2 - Grgur Petric Maretic 0


From watching Saito play the red deck, it feels that he has really figured out how his various matchups work. Against Faeries, his style wasn’t as aggressive as it could have been. Effectively the control, he played out a threat or two, saving much of his burn for when faeries actually started attacking. With ways to deal with [Mistbind Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) as and when it came up, this matchup didn’t feel remotely close.


Tomoharu Saito is now poised in a position to go entirely undefeated across the entire Swiss portion of a GP. A worthy Player of the Year.




Meet the Artists, Part 2
------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop08/Jim-Nelson-hard-at-work.jpg)*Jim Nelson Hard at Work.*After meeting and chatting with Magic artist Jesper Ejsing yesterday, today I caught up with Jim Nelson, who was caught under a mountain of Faerie Rogue tokens.


“I have signed so many of these this weekend!” laughed Jim, who has never been approached by anyone with as many copies of a single card as he has by people this weekend, looking to make their Bitterblossom hordes all the more impressive.


Jim has been involved with Magic since around 1997, and has in that time produced a great many iconic pieces of artwork, including the likes of Cunning Wish and Grim Lavamancer.


Nelson brings both orignals and the concept sketches for some of his works to events for fans to see, and potentially acquire. As he drew a sketch of a dwarf on the playmat of one lucky player, he confessed that drawing is his favourite part of events.


“I started out doing a degree in illustration, but quickly moved onto doing a whole degree in drawing.”


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop08/Griffin-Guide-has-legs.jpg)*Griffin Guide has legs.*The movement from pencil drawings to the full acrylic masterpieces produced by Nelson is a dramatic one. Frequently Nelson will pick a very limited palette with which to create his works, to give them a unified feel, and also as a little game for himself.


“I did the art for [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) using just three colours, just to see how what I could achieve with limited options.”


Jim’s own favourite piece is [Griffin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide), which he drew as a full length piece, in the hope that it would become one of the extended art promotional cards. That hasn’t happened yet, but for any of you interested, this is how it looks.


Finally, a few people (including my Mum!) have been asking me what my laptop looks like now, and exactly what the term ‘pimp my laptop’ means. Well, in this case, I’m pretty sure a picture is easier for me than a thousand words. Here is my current (teeny weeny) coverage laptop, coming to a feature match area near you.

Round 13 Feature Match: Fired – Antti Malin vs Jan Doise
--------------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop08/antti.jpg)*Antti Malin.* Antti Malin of Finland is a regular both on the European GP circuit, and at the Pro Tour. With his Quick and Toast build he seemed comfortable and in control, making his position in round 13, battling for top 8, no great surprise. Jan Doise of Belgium had come armed with mono-red, the most popular deck of the format, and one that appeared to be living up to the hype.


Antti won the roll, and led with [Grove of the Burnwillows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows). He had a turn two [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) with which he would well be able to block the turn two [Blood Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight) that came from Doise. The wall got extra duty in by providing the mana to evoke [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) to find a third land for Antti, but soon was finished off by [Flame Javelin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin), allowing Doise to rumble in.


“You gain 1 life, I’ll gain 2” remarked Malin as he played a [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), having tapped [Grove of the Burnwillows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows). His Quick and Toast build was sorted for mana, but had a few concerns about the offense coming from the other side of the board. [Ashenmoor Gouger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashenmoor+Gouger) was soon joined by [Demigod of Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge), making for some huge attacks.


[Sower of Temptation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation) from Antti took the Demigod briefly, long enough to mean that an Incinerate on the Sower during Jan’s turn would not allow attacks from the five drop that was still tapped. Doise filled his board with a [Magus of the Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Scroll) and [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) – he didn’t want to be in a position where Antti got any more turns to draw answers to his aggressive deck.


Antti had another [Sower of Temptation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation), but not enough mana to do a great deal more, and when the Sower was killed off, he briskly reached for his sideboard. It was on to Game 2.


Antti Malin 0 – 1 Jan Doise


“What was the last card in you hand?”


“Another Demigod”


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop08/jan.jpg)*Jan Doise is ready with his burn.jpg.*
Antti winced. Much talk has been made of the ‘double D’ draw, and how tough it can be for control decks to deal with. As it turns out, Doise hadn’t even needed to get that second 5/4 flier going.


For game 2, Antti led with a [Vivid Grove](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivid+Grove), while Doise had a [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny). The Kithkin leveled up and swung the very next turn. After a little thought, Malin evoked a [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) and passed, open to taking big hits from Doise if he chose to make his [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) a 4/4. As it is, the Figure ran in for 2, and Doise tooled up with an [Ashenmoor Gouger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashenmoor+Gouger). More of a blunt object than a tool, the Gouger ran in the very next turn, taking down a [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) from Malin, while a now 4/4 [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) killed off a [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks).


Malin’s next play was a [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), which could get back that [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) and [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), while trading with either of Doise’s creatures. *That* is the way to slow down some attacks. Rather than a futile swing, Doise sat back with his creatures, adding a [Blood Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight) and a [Magus of the Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Scroll) to his board. Still stuck on 3 land, he looked at his hand carefully. Were there some Demigods in there?


Malin attacked with his [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), and played a second. This looked to be bad news for Doise after so promising a Game 1. Doise’s best line of attack was [Blood Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight), who was unblockable by any of Malin’s team. He attacked with one and made a second, but this was not a race he was winning. Both [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark)s attacked, putting Doise to 8. There was still 18 damage for Doise to deal.


Malin cast a [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots), and [Runed Halo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Halo), naming [Blood Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight). At the end of turn, Doise played Incinerate on Malin and followed in his turn with attacks from Ashenmoor Gorger and [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny). Each was blocked, and after casting [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny), Doise passed.


He had a Skred and a [Flame Javelin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin) to kill of both [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark)s, which effectively turned into [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) and [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots). A *third* [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) came down, but one was killed off by attacks from Doise and a [Keldon Megaliths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Megaliths) activation. Doise now had 2 [Keldon Megaliths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Megaliths) and was playing off the top of his deck. On 8, he was in a little trouble, but had the tools to deal quite a bit of damage.


“Play or suspend?” Antti asked himself, looking at a [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon), and a huge amount of lands in his hand. After some thought he suspended the massive monster and passed.


Doise attacked with those members of his team who weren’t stymied by [Runed Halo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Halo), or [Magus of the Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Scroll), who had better plans. Two were blocked by [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots), and he snuck in two damage.


[Magus of the Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Scroll) killed off [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), and Jan followed up with Magus of the moon, turning all but one of Antti’s lands into [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s. He had a lone [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots), so Malin wasn’t quite as addled by the 2/2 as Quick and Toast often is, but nevertheless drew and passed on his turn.


For the following turn, a [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) became 8/8, and the team swung. This took Antti to 4.


“Topdeck time?”


Antti drew a [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), and evoked it. Two more chances at what he needed. A glum face from Antti showed that he hadn’t found what he wanted. A Pyroclasm would have got him the win by clearing up all of Jan’s blockers, and allowing [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon) in.


It was not to be though, and Jan Doise took it down 2-0.


  


Podcast: Never In History
-------------------------


*by Rich Hagon*

Fifteen years, hundreds of Grand Prix, thousands upon thousands of matches. Nobody has ever won one of these monsters by going undefeated. John Ormerod of Great Britain managed the 100% record through the Swiss, but couldn't get over the finish line. Now Tomaharu Saitou, 6-0 overnight and 3-0 as we start this show, looks to achieve the near-impossible. Can he do it? We're getting closer to an answer.

Feature Match: Round 14 - Buckle up folks, this one will be close
-----------------------------------------------------------------


*by Daniel Ullenius*

Both players entered the fray knowing that whoever would be the victor of the upcoming battle would prepare for top 8 magic. Nakamura relied on his Elves while Wafo-Tapa relies on his Quick 'n' toast.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop08/Guillaume-Wafo-Tapa.jpg)Wafo-Tapa won the roll, and both players kept their openings.


A [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) from Nakamura was matched by a [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots), who got immediately got an Eyeblight Ending to the head. Nakamura played a [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) to help his mana, but it was met by a [Rune Snag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag) from Wafo-Tapa.


Wafo missed a land drop but made up for it with a [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots), while Nakamura made a [Chameleon Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus). Wafo-Tapa was in a pretty though spot very early in the game, but played it cool and utilised the power of [Careful Consideration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration) to gain some card advantage. Nakamura smashed with his team of [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and a [Chameleon Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus), and Wafo-Tapa decided to give the colossus the cold hand with a [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn).


Nakamura tried a 4/5 [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) which was met with nothing but a nod from Wafo-Tapa. Nakamura played another [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and Wafo-Tapa answered with a [Mystical Teachings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings) for [Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Mage+of+Zhalfir). On his turn, Wafo-Tapa made nothing but a land, while Nakamura decieded to play nasty with a Thoughtsize, which took life totals to 22 - 14 in his favour.


The Thoughtsize was countered by a [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), and Nakamura went in with 2 [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), a [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and a [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). The Goyf was slaughtered by a [Slaughter Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact), and the Elv was [Firespout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout)ed. Nakamura attacked with 2x Treetop, and Wafo-Tapa did nothing but draw and go. Nakamura played [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), and Wafo-Tapa played his tutored Teferi at the end of turn. Nakamura tried again with a Thoughtsize, but it was met with command number two from Wafo-Tapa. Shuhei played a Cameleon Colossus, and Wafo-Tapa flashed in a Wall of Root at the end of his op turn, together with an oona who made Nakamura pack up his cards.


Shuhei Nakamura 0 - Guillaume Wafo-Tapa 1


Nakamura kept his opening hand while Wafo-Tapa decided to take a trip back to Paris once.


Nakamura started out hard with a Thoughtsize which took a [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) from Wafo-Tapa's hand. Shuhei continued on strong with a 2/3 [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and a [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), while Wafo-Tapa only played lands.


The Japanese player continued to accelerate with an [Wren's Run Vanquisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wren%27s+Run+Vanquisher), and Wafo-Tapa desperately struggled for mass removal with an evoked [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter).


Nakamuras next attack of Vanquisher, Goyf and a [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) took Wafo-Tapa to 6, but when facing a lethal attack from Tarmogofy and [Wren's Run Vanquisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wren%27s+Run+Vanquisher), Wafo-Tapa played a [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). Nakamura still beat on with a [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), and Wafo-Tapa was on 3. A [Runed Halo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Halo) from Wafo-Tapa named [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), and he [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)ed his opponents attack once again. Nakamura did not stop at all as he played a [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) and a [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder). The third time around Wafo-Tapa stifled the deadly attack [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), and Nakamura played a [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and passed. Wafo-Tapa tried an end step [Careful Consideration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration) which yielded him nothing, and it was on to game 3.


Nakamura started off with a [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and a [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) into [Wren's Run Vanquisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wren%27s+Run+Vanquisher) while Wafo-Tapa played lands and accelerated his mana with a [Coalition Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Relic). The Vanquisher got Condemed and Nakamura fetched a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) with [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder), while Wafo-Tapa did nothing.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop08/Shuheu-R14.jpg)Nakamura tried for a 1/2 [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) that got [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)ed, but he still got in an attack with [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder). A beast-making [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) on the next turn threatend to get ugly for Wafo-Tapa, who played a [Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Mage+of+Zhalfir) at the end of Nakamuras turn. On his next turn, Nakamura tapped out, untapped two lands using Garruk, and played a criminally big [Profane Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Profane+Command) for 4, possibly returning his 4/5 [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and killing off Wafo-Tapa's Teferi. Wafo-Tapa however responded with a [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) which unfortuneally did not give him anything. Teferi went down and Nakamura charged in for 4 with Wayfinder and a [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault). [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) blocked the [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), and Nakamura passed the turn, content with the situation.


Wafo-Tapa first played a [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots), and then the card-drawing machine named [Careful Consideration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration), which got him double [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots). This did not stop the aggressive Nakamura from attacking with two [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), a 3/3 Beast-token and [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) which took his opponent to 6.


Wafo-Tapa continued his quest for card advantage and massremoval and played a second [Careful Consideration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration), netting him a [Runed Halo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Halo) naming [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village). Nakamura played another [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) which got it's owner a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp). He continued to made a 3/3 Beast with [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) and tapped out for a Chameleon Collossus who got [Rune Snag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag)ged. Wafo-Tapa thought for a while, counted his mana and flashbacked a Mystical teachings mainphase which tutored for another Teachings.


Nakamura attacked with his team of 2 Beasts, a [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and two [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder). The beasts and a [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) got blocked, the [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) got [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn)ed but a least a Wayfinder got in for 2 damage. A second [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) fom Nakamura met no counterspells from Wafo-Tapa, who played his second [Mystical Teachings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings) mainphase, fetching a second [Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Mage+of+Zhalfir). On his turn, Nakamura's Elves did that they to best and charged into the red zone, only after being pumped by [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker). Wafo-Tapa played a [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) which tapped his opponents team, and played his Teferi at the end of the turn.


Nakamura animated his [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and attacked with [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), two [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder)s, two Beast tokens and a [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault). Wafo-Tapa flashed in a [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) which blocked a [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), while Teferi and a [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) took on the tokens. When everything was settled, Wafo-Tapa was on 1.


Nakamura tried for a [Eyeblight's Ending](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending) on Wafo-Tapa's [Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Mage+of+Zhalfir), but Wafo-Tapa countered it with [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), which also drew him a card. He then proceeded to play a second [Runed Halo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Halo) naming [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), and at the end of the turn, he flashbacked a [Mystical Teachings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings) for a [Oona, Queen of the Fae](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%2C+Queen+of+the+Fae). Things were looking grim for Nakamura as the Queen came flashing in, and when Nakamura tried to attack, Wafo-Tapa played Oona's ability on not less then eleven naming green, giving him 5 tokens, and Nakamura scooped up his cards.
