[Karplusan Yeti](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karplusan+Yeti) hasn't been in print since the days of *Ice Age* back in 1995 and 1996. When the card was more commonly around, many players gave the card only a casual glance and missed the yeti in the process. (This *is* a yeti we're talking about though, so that seems pretty appropriate.)

In this enlarged version of Quinton Hoover's piece, it's a lot easier to see what's going on. (And that flavor text makes a lot more sense too.)

The players may not have been the only ones that missed what was going on in this piece however. Whoever picked out the packaging art for *Ice Age* may have made the same mistake, leading to what may very well be the only case of **Magic** packaging featuring the "wrong" part of a card's art!
