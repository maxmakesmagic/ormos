Some of the most beautiful **Magic** art isn’t on its spells and lands, but on tokens. *Lorwyn* follows in *Tenth Edition’s* footsteps by including a sixteenth card into every booster pack. Every time you open a [pack](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/events/releases) of *Lorwyn*, you might get a tips and tricks card (some of which are reminders about how planeswalkers work, this time around) or a creature token.

Today we take a look at some of the gorgeous art produced for some of Lorwyn’s token cards.
