The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 23, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by so very many *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* drafts.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

This was basically my entire Twitter feed yesterday once *Magic Online* drafts for *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* started. And it seems like basically anything is viable, as long as you go hard enough. You can [go aggressive](https://twitter.com/Conley81/status/844750634037510147), [controlling](https://twitter.com/NumotTheNummy/status/844776829223264256), or just [make a ton of tokens](https://twitter.com/Top8Games/status/844798557710278656). Whatever they choose, it seems like people are having a blast.


1. [30 Life for 1v1 Commander](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/158715254664/30-life-for-1v1-commander)

Yes, 1v1 Commander support is coming to *Magic Online*, complete with a new banned list. We'll have a longer update on this likely in mid- to late-April.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Developing *Modern Masters 2017* with Adam Prosak](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/2017/03/23/e086-developing-modern-masters-2017-with-adam-prosak-commanderin-mtg-podcast.html) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Nate Burgess, and Sean Whatson

Adam Prosak, lead developer of *Modern Masters 2017 Edition*, goes deep on what makes the set tick with the Commanderin' crew, including everything from individual cards all the way up to the interlocking archetypes.


1. [7 Best MM3 Rares in Limited](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/freyalise/holistic-wisdom-7-best-mm3-rares-in-limited) | MTG Mint Card | Freyalise

And if listening to Prosak wax and wane about *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* Limited makes you want to draft, Freyalise is here to clue you in on the best rares to crack should you be so fortunate.


1. [MTGO Overview, Steps and Phases, and an *Aether Revolt* Crack-a-Draft](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-381-mtgo-overview-steps-and-phases-and-an-aether-revolt-crack-a-draft/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

Marshall and Luis are in teaching mode today, talking *Magic Online* how-tos and *Magic*'s phases and steps (and where to set stops on *Magic Online* so you don't run through key points of the turn).


But don't listen to them. Real gamers set exactly two stops—post-combat main phase and opponent's draw step. What else would you really need?


1. [Against the Odds: Spore Life (Modern)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-spore-life-modern?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

[Sporemound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporemound) and [Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb) aren't exactly Modern powerhouses. But the fans get what the fans want. And in this case they wanted a 3/3 for five paired up with a four-mana enchantment that makes all of your lands vulnerable to removal. Just like the best decks!


1. [Facts of the Grind](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34788_Facts-Of-The-Grind.html) | StarCityGames.com | Emma Handy

This article isn't for everyone, but it's pretty good fodder for the grinders and those who are thinking about taking on tournament *Magic* more regularly. Handy talks about her year on the StarCityGames.com tour and what it takes to play this much tournament *Magic* week in and week out.


1. [Rogue's Alley: Standard Bant Angels](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/kevincrimin-03232017-rogues-alley-standard-bant-angels/) | Gathering Magic | Kevin Crimin

It's been a while since anyone has tried to fuse [Bruna, the Fading Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bruna%2C+the+Fading+Light) and [Gisela, the Broken Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gisela%2C+the+Broken+Blade), but the combination of [Aetherworks Marvel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) and [Eldritch Evolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldritch+Evolution) makes that prospect a little bit easier. Check out this brew and the accompanying video to see just how simple it can be.


Top 25
======


1. Yuuya Watanabe is still great

Though he's been relatively quiet lately, Yuuya Watanabe is never one to be underestimated. Ever. He recently jumped up six slots on the Top 25—now to No. 17—on the back of a 12-3 performance at [Grand Prix Shizuoka](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpshi17) that saw him just one match win out a potential Top 8. Also finishing 12-3 was Yuuki Ichikawa, who rejoins the Top 25 again on the strength of that performance.


That means the Top 25 lost one Pascal Maynard, who slipped just off the list, as his 2017 season hasn't been quite as strong as his 2016 one when he challenged for Grand Prix Master.

Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Red-Green Energy](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-03-21)

This deck has been around for a while, but it has picked up steam as players learn how to adjust it to the new metagame. The aggressive nature of the deck keeps Saheeli decks on their toes, and the explosiveness lets it go toe-to-toe with even the most aggressive Mardu Vehicles draws. And don't forget that [Blossoming Defense](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blossoming+Defense) shuts down the ever-important [Unlicensed Disintegration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration).


This particular list is by Mayhem1287, who went 5-0 in a Standard Competitive League recently. There's a bit of play in which pump spells you want to use and what, precisely, the sideboard looks like, but this is certainly a good place to start.
