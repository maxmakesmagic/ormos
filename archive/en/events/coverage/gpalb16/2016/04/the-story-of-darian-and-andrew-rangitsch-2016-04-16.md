Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






We play games to pass the time, to think critically, and to challenge ourselves. Somewhere in the thick of things, the games become more human. We interact with our teammates and opponents on a level that transcends normal conversation. For many of us, games like Magic provide a true human experience that connects us to people more than any other facet of our lives.


Magic has the ability to transform who we are: Through the people we meet and through the experiences we share.


Darian Harmon was a self-described nerd living in Oklahoma. She decided to join a roleplaying group at her local game store and met Andrew Rangitsch, who was DMing their campaign.


The two became quick friends. Andrew taught Darian how to play Magic and they started playing local Two-Headed Giant events together. Andrew and Darian were both interested in each other, but neither of the two caught on to the other’s flirting as their friendship continued to grow.


Months later, the two went on a date to The Omniplex, a science museum, together and made their feelings and relationship something more official.

Darian called Andrew [Silverblade Paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverblade+Paladin) and Andrew called Darian [Wolfir Silverheart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfir+Silverheart); On their own, they felt vanilla, but together they became something incredible.


They spent countless hours in the car together on long road trips to gaming events and enjoyed the other’s company more with each passing day.


The local Journey into Nyx prerelease featured a Two-Headed Giant event. Darian cracked open her prerelease pack and found a note,


“Will you be my Two-Headed Giant partner forever?”


Copies of [Silverblade Paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverblade+Paladin) and [Wolfir Silverheart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfir+Silverheart) cradled an engagement ring.


Darian said yes and the two played what I can only imagine was the best Two-Headed Giant tournament of their lives.


Darian and Andrew had a quite literally magical wedding:


The guestbook was a pile of lands that the two would then use for their Commander decks. Every game of Commander they played henceforth was a reminder of the friends and family that love and support them.


The tables were named after Khans and Guilds.


The cake toppers were Jace in a top hat and Chandra with a veil.


Life isn’t always easy and the two were thrown for a loop as a death in the family was followed by a series of health problems. Through all of it, the two stuck together and helped keep the other’s head above water.


True love transcends and conquers all other things.


Now they’ve decided to spend their wedding anniversary here at Grand Prix Albuquerque. They booked the trip early. They’ve been eating at nice restaurants. And today they’ll have their chance to do what they love to do together.


“Nothing and everything changes when you get married,” said Darian with a smile.


Transformed, a pair of lonely wanderers find themselves as fourteen double-striking power, ready to take on the world.
