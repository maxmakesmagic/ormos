Since you're here, we can assume that you enjoy reading words written about **Magic**. But what about *listening*? Have you ever tried that? It's pretty relaxing, and it leaves your eyes free for other tasks. And one of the best ways to listen to people talking about **Magic** is to listen to a **Magic** podcast!


[![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/activity/act385_mtgcast.jpg)](http://www.mtgcast.com)If you want to listen to a *lot* of podcasts, the place to go is [MTGCast](http://www.mtgcast.com), which has about forty on offer. We're not going to try to compete with their list here. We're just hitting a few highlights.


* **[Monday Night Magic](http://www.mtgcast.com/?cat=15)**
+ When we asked for podcast recommendations on @[dailymtg](http://www.twitter.com/dailymtg), Monday Night Magic was the runaway favorite. They review the news of the week in **Magic**, and they're approved by our Twitter followers.

* **[Limited Resources](http://www.mtgcast.com/?cat=65)**
+ Marshall and Ryan host the most popular limited-focused podcast. The focus is on strategy and general Spikiness.

* **[The Mana Pool](http://themanapool.libsyn.com/)**
+ Brian, Mike, Dirk, and Chewie focus on fun and multiplayer and prereleases and fun.

* **[Top 8 Magic](http://www.top8magic.com/category/podcasts/)**
+ Mike Flores and Brian David-Marshall don't just write for us, you know. Sometimes they do podcasts! And in those podcasts, they're sometimes joined by Will Price.

* **[Judgecast](http://judgecast.mananation.com/)**
+ This is a fairly new podcast aimed at judges, hosted by Riki Hayashi and Sean Catanese. It's part of [ManaNation](http://www.mananation.com)'s offerings.

* **[Protection from Noob](http://www.mtgcast.com/?cat=79)**
+ This brand new podcast emanates from the UK and is hosted by Lennox and Josh.

* **[Yo! MTG Taps](http://www.mtgcast.com/?cat=66)**
+ That is an awesome name for a podcast.

* **[Event Coverage Podcasts](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Downloads.aspx?tag=podcast&description=Podcast)**
+ We couldn't leave out our own podcast. Rich Hagon reports from multiple premier events around the globe.

### Video Podcasts


* **[The Magic Show](http://www.starcitygames.com/pages/articlefinder.php?keyword=Evan+Erwin)**
+ Evan Erwin's videos are very popular and widely viewed. He even went to the [2007 **Magic** Invitational](/en/events/coverage/tiago-triumphant) on the strength of The Magic Show.

* **[Magic TV](http://strategy.channelfireball.com/tag/magic-tv/)**
+ Luis Scott-Vargas sits down with guests in the "Magic TV" weekly series.

* **[ManaNation](http://www.mananation.com/category/episodes/)**
+ Trick Jarrett of ManaNation hosts this weekly look at things in the world of **Magic**. To be honest with you, we're running out of ways to say "this is a **Magic** podcast."

*Have you seen an interesting **Magic** discussion somewhere? Let us know at @[dailymtg](http://www.twitter.com/dailymtg) or post in our own forums (the "Discuss on the message boards" link below will help) and maybe we'll feature it on **Community Spotlight**!*
