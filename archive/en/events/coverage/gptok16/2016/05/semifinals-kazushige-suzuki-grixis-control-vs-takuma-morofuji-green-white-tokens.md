Kazushige Suzuki simply wants to watch the world burn, figuratively. His Grixis Control simply has the ability to annihilate anything in his way.

[Ruinous Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruinous+Path), [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price), [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command), [Silumgar's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Command) and [Fiery Impulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Impulse) will all go very nicely with [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). Aside from [Read the Bones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones), his other sources of card advantage comes from the multiple "Snapcaster Mages" which he is running, namely [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) and [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers).

Takuma Morofuji is the 2005 Japanese National Champion, and a 2005 Team Worlds Champion. After taking a break in 2006, he returns nearly 10 years later and won Grand Prix Kobe 2015. Today, he is playing for his second title in his second Grand Prix Top 8 and has White-Green Tokens by his side, except that he's running with the long-forgotten Megamorph package of [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) and [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor).


Game 1
======


Suzuki kicked off with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) to remove [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar), the most problematic card in his eyes. When [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) appeared, [Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone) got rid of it. Suzuki cashed in the Clue, and even found time to cast [Read the Bones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones).


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sylvan+Advocate)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate)
A pair of [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate)s hit the board, which would have been a decent amount of pressure if not for Suzuki's mighty [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers) provided additional defense, as he recast [Read the Bones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones) once more.


However, the reason that Morofuji wasn't budging was apparent. With only 5 lands in play, the [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate)s were just 2/3s. Also, he couldn't activate [Westvale Abbey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Westvale+Abbey) to start growing his team. A second copy of [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers) allowed Suzuki to recast [Transgress the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind), which cruelly plucked [Dragonlord Dromoka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Dromoka) from Morofuji's grip.


When Morofuji finally found his sixth land, it would seem that it was too late, facing a board against [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet), double [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers) and [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) which was about to transform very soon. To make matters worse, [Virulent Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Virulent+Plague) shut out any [Westvale Abbey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Westvale+Abbey) shenanigans.

*Morofuji nearly gets to the finish line.*


However, Suzuki did encounter a near-death experience. Since he was only at 9 life, he could lose the game if Morofuji chumped with a creature and then flashed in [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) at the end of the turn. Since a creature died, she'd transform, dealing Suzuki 3 damage, and then 6 with the attack.


To prevent that, Morofuji decided to attack with his team, since it was lethal damage. Morofuji was forced to cast [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) before blockers, and Suzuki gave it -2/-0 with [Jace, Telepath Unbound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Telepath+Unbound).


Escaping death, he untapped and cleared the path with [Ruinous Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruinous+Path), prompting Morofuji to concede.


**Kazushige Suzuki 1 - Takuma Morofuji 0**


Game 2
======


Suzuki could have very easily lost the second game, if not for the Turn 1 [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) to prevent Morofuji from landing a Turn 2 [Evolutionary Leap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolutionary+Leap). This is the best card Morofuji can ask for in this matchup, since he be able to replace every creature which dies and eventually run the Grixis player out of removal spells and bury him with card advantage.

*Suzuki pilots his Grixis deck masterfully.*


After using [Ruinous Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruinous+Path) to kill [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) and [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers) to kill another, Suzuki made [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). It was ensnared by [Stasis Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Snare), but a second copy arrived.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Evolutionary+Leap)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolutionary+Leap)
[Evolutionary Leap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolutionary+Leap) #2 was his next card, which could try to pull him back into the game. Carefully managing his life total and creating some tokens via [Westvale Abbey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Westvale+Abbey), he was eventually able to find [Dragonlord Dromoka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Dromoka).


Thankfully, Suzuki was able to seal the game before it could hit the board. Activating [Wandering Fumarole](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wandering+Fumarole) and attacking with all his creatures, it was barely enough to end things right there before [Evolutionary Leap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolutionary+Leap) could rebuild Morofuji's board.


"Thank you very much for the game, it was such a great match and you're really difficult to beat," Suzuki.


"No worries, go win the finals" was the sincere reply.
