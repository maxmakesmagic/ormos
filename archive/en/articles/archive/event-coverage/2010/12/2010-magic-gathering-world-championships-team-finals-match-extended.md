### Australia's Jeremy Neeman ([Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension)) vs. Slovak Republic's Robert Jurkovic (Faeries)


The Extended match in the World Team Finals saw Robert Jurkovic of the Slovak Republic match up his Faeries against the [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) list of Jeremy Neeman, a potentially tough match for the Australian.


Jurkovic had to be pretty happy with how his Extended match started, as [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) snagged a [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) from Neeman's hand. It left [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) and [See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond), along with a [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) and [Cascade Bluffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cascade+Bluffs).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/tf3_jurkovic_neeman.jpg)*Robert Jurkovic of the Slovak Republic and Jeremy Neeman of Australia battle it out alongside their respective teams.*Neeman was quick to cast his card drawing spells, including cantripping [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) into [See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond). A [Broken Ambitions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Ambitions) stopped that, and milled Neeman for four (something he may not have minded). What he was probably slightly more troubled by, though, was the second [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), which snagged a second [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). Neeman kept digging with [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)â€”he was still on just two land, while Jurkovic had quickly risen to four mana available. Another [See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond) came from Neeman, and this time it resolved.


Jurkovic had mana up, even with attacks coming across from his [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault). A [Scion of Oona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+Oona) met a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) from Neeman, and [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) a [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning). Neeman then tried for [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). Jurkovic had [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Neeman did too. Jurkovic had another, meaning that three of the four copies of [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) in Neeman's deck were used up. Jurkovic was ready to go on the attack. He cast first a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) to filter his own draws, and then a [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom).


When Neeman cast his fourth [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), it met a sigh from Jurkovic. Could he really lose from the position of strength he'd been in all game? Neeman passed. Jurkovic ran in with his team. Neeman had ... nothing. He scooped up his cards having run out of gas just a little too soon for the comeback.


Jurkovic 1, Neeman 0


**Game 2**


After a double mulligan, Neeman seemed a little sad to face down a first turn [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), to show he'd kept a one-land hand with [Volcanic Fallout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout), Jaces's Ingenuity, [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), and [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). The Leak went first. Next turn a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) took the [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), and [Volcanic Fallout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout) fell to the second [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/tf3_jurkovic.jpg)*Jurkovic counts on victory.*Neeman's first spell was a [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), which Jurkovic tried to stop with [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite), with the Sprite's ability on the stack, Neeman targeted it with [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning). Jurkovic then used a [Peppersmoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peppersmoke) on it, so that he would at least get a card. [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) finally did its thing, and gave Neeman some much needed options on cards.


When Jurkovic went for a draw step [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique), Neeman played a clutch [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity) before he lost the option to. He looked on as this allowed a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) to resolve, having the [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to bounce it and draw later.


One interesting element of the sideboarded games in this matchup is that Neeman has the option to sideboard into a [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) / [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) kill, which does not need to worry about graveyard disruption, or keeping permanents on board for any length of time. In sideboarding, Jurkovic had to respect this as a possibility, hence the [Peppersmoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peppersmoke) seen in Game 2.


[Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) from Jurkovic was a far bigger game than [Peppersmoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peppersmoke) on his own. He came down through a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), thanks to Jurkovic also having a copy of the 2 mana counter. Neeman was on the back foot, and cast first [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity), then [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), looking for answers. He found one in [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), to kill Jace off in one shot.


With Neeman tapped out, a [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) was the next attack vector for Jurkovic. He let a [See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond) resolve, and took a little time to update his teammates on his position. The last match going, Jurkovic now knew that he was in the decider. If he won this game then the Slovak Republic would be the World Team Champions. Neeman's [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) also resolved.


The Slovaks seemed happy to wait for team Australia to make a move. [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) was slowly building them an armyâ€”they didn't need to do anything. Australia did need to make a move, and the move was [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). Jurkovic responded with a [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique), championing [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom). Neeman floated mana, and tried for a [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning). It was stopped by [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite), but still helped trigger [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). A [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) got the Ascension all the way, after which Neeman passed.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/tf3_neeman.jpg)*Jeremy Neeman is all that stands between the Slovak Republic and World(s) domination.*[Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) bounced [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) on Jurkovic's turn, and the attack that followed dropped the Australian to 4. He would have to do something decisive, as one more attack would be lethal.


Another [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) came. [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) bounced [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) and triggered the Ascension for one counter. That was all Neeman had, though, and he passed it back.


Attacks from Jurkovic put Neeman on two. Jurkovic replayed the [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) on Neeman's turn, and that was enough to get the handshake.


**Jurkovic 2, Neeman 0**
