2010 Great Britain National Championship
----------------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gbnat10/gb_team2010.jpg)Congratulations to Joe Jackson, the 2010 Great Britain National Champion, and his teammates going to Chiba, Richard Bland, Daniel Gardner and Jonathan Randle! 172 players sat down on Friday as Great Britain's National Championships began, but on Sunday only eight remained. There were two past National Champions, in Dan Gardner and Jonathan Randle, and neither disappointed in making it to the final four. It was Joe Jackson and Richard Bland, who had built their deck together the night before the event, who proved the toughest competitors in the final stages though. Bland had lost only a single Standard game with his deck before facing his teammate in the 75-card mirror. It was not to be his day though, as Jackson powered through to victory to become the first Scottish player to hoist high the trophy of Great Britain National Champion.


So ends a fantastic four days of **Magic** here in London, England. We've had just about every format under the sun all under one roof here, and the party atmosphere continues even after the main event has finished. While it may still be months away, Britain's national team are already looking expectantly toward December in Chiba. We'll see you there.
