**What do you think is the strongest color combination in Mirrodin Limited?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Masashi Oiso:** "I personally think Affinity is really strong, so I like to use blue, although lately blue is getting more and more popular, making it hard to get. Lately, I've been trying out W-G." | **Jin Okamoto:** "I like blue. I like drawing cards." | **Masahiko Morita:** "I think blue, red, and green are the strongest colors in the set, so any combination of those is good." |

**Which *Mirrodin* card do you think is having the biggest impact on the Standard environment?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Itaru Ishida:** "[Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge)." | **Akira Asahara:** "[Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver)." | **Tomohiro Yokosuka:** "I think the Affinity mechanic will probably have a big impact on Standard, more than any one card. I can't think of anything in particular that I want to try to break." |

**Do you think it's possible to send clear signals in *Mirrodin* draft, when half the set is colorless?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Kazuya Hirabayashi:** "Definitely. If you don't do so early on, you're going to end up in trouble." | **Ken'ichi Fujita:** "Of course. Go away." | **Katsuhiro Mori:** "More or less. But I think it's hard to cooperate. Especially with people like you hate drafting all the time! [directed at Shuu Komuro, who was sitting next to Mori]." |

**What do you think the best common in *Mirrodin* Limited is?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Masami Ibamoto:** "[Spikeshot Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin)." | **Tsuyoshi Fujita:** "[Bonesplitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter)." | **Kouichirou Maki:** "Good questionâ€¦I guess I'll say [Bonesplitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter)." |

**What card do you most want to open in *Mirrodin* draft?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Kouhei Yamadaya:** "[Bonesplitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter)." | **Shuu Komuro:** "[Loxodon Warhammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer)." | **Royce Chai:** "[Loxodon Warhammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer)." |
