Or take part in the main tournament and get a cool foil Maelstrom Pulse promo card and a Planeswalker deck box! 


Whatever you want to do, Grand Prix Milan will be a weekend to remember! 


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).
