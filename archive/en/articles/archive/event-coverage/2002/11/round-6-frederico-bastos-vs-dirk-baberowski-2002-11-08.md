Frederico is one of the few people in this tournament who's running a true beatdown deck and has to face the German Reanimator deck. Both these gentlemen are at 3-2 so they need a win to be able to draw in next round.

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a532.jpg)Frederico wins the flip and plays [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic). Next turn he [Reckless Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge)s the [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic), coming in for 4. Dirk just continues to play [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s. On his next turn, Frederico [Sonic Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sonic+Burst)s Dirk, and serves for one. Dirk [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor)s for an [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb), and spends his turn [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ing a [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) and Exhuming it. Frederico responds by sacrificing his [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic), bringing Dirk to 8 life and shows him [Sonic Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sonic+Burst) and [Reckless Abandon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Abandon).

Dirk sides in 2 [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator)s and [Phantom Nishoba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Nishoba) for [Rushing River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rushing+River), [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake) and [Thrashing Wumpus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrashing+Wumpus). Frederico brings in 2 [Threaten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten) for 2 [Goblin Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Patrol)s.

### Game 2

Dirk mulligans and frowns at his next 6 cards. He starts with [Underground River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+River) and [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)es Frederico. He takes [Threaten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten) out of a hand containing [Goblin Cadets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Cadets), [Goblin Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Patrol), [Firebolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt), [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock), [Barbarian Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Ring) and [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) as well. Frederico plays the Patrol, and Dirk [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)s and [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)s a [Phantom Nishoba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Nishoba). Frederico starts shrinking it by throwing a [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) at it. During Dirk's next attack phase, John Larkin, at the neighboring table, starts shouting as he's winning

Larkin "GO Nishoba GO! And you should cheer for my Multani"  
 Baberowski "I dunno – how big is it?"  
 Larkin "9/9 and it mindtwisted him (Jeff Cunningham)"  
 Baberowski "Go Multani"  
 Bastos "I don't know what to do..."  
 Baberowski "I don't know what you should do either. I guess I could sit here and block but it doesn't sounds like the right thing to do..."

Frederico let the suffering continue for a little longer and scooped two turns later.

### Game 3

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a533.jpg)Frederico leads with a [Bloodstained Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire) and [Jackal Pup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup). Next turn he drops a Pup and [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), quite the start for Sligh. Dirk however, [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ed a [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) and [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume)d it. Frederico then played a [Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire), and felt the match slipping away quickly. A [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) reveals a [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock), [Reckless Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge) and [Goblin Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Patrol). After getting rid of the [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock), Dirk sends a token into the Red Zone. Frederico makes the [Goblin Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Patrol) and blocks the [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) with it next turn. Dirk casts a [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) next turn, and sends in some more tokens. One attack phase later and Dirk gets a chance to draw into day 2.

**Final Result:** Dirk Baberowksi 2 – Frederico Bastos 1
