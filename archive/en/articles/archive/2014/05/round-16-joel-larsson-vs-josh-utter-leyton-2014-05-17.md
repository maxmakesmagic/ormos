 It can be difficult to describe the tension of a match like this. The pressure, the attention, the waiting eyes of not only the players on site but the thousands watching from home. The thousands of dollars on the line, the Pro Points, the tournament invites, the fans who take sides.



There's almost nothing like a win-and-in Round 16 of a Pro Tour, and this one in particular has a crushing amount of pressure on it. For one, No. 13 Josh Utter-Leyton is the lone 36 pointer to get paired down, turning what must have surely been relief and happiness at what looked like a sure trip to his fifth Pro Tour Top 8 into yet another round, another grind, another world-class player to take down.


Joel Larsson must feel it as well. Though he has to play, his back is truly against the wall. There's a chance Utter-Leyton could make the Top 8 regardless of his result here—not necessarily a good one, but certainly a chance—but Larsson can only pick up his second Top 8 with a win. 





*The pressure was on for Joel Larsson and No. 13 Ranked Player Josh Utter-Leyton. Utter-Leyton faced a rough round by being paired down, as his "win and in" from last round no longer mattered. He needed to escape this match without a loss.*
