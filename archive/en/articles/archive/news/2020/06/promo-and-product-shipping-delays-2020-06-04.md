Because of continued shipping delays due to COVID-19, we have two shipping delays to relay today.


First, the promos for the [Love Your Local Game Store promotion](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-love-your-lgs-promotion-2020-05-18) will be delayed until at least June 12. Mystery Booster allocations may arrive earlier, so stores may be able to allow you to pick up your promo at a later date with a purchase starting this weekend. Check with your local game store first.


Over in Europe, *Jumpstart* and both versions of the Starter Kits will be released later than previously announced. Amazon version of the *Core Set 2021* Starter Kit will release July 24, while the normal version of the *Core Set 2021* Starter Kit will release August 21. We'll have more information on *Jumpstart* as we get closer.


These delays are unfortunate and only affect the European region, and we look forward to a return to normalcy once we can ensure the continued health and safety of those who help make our game possible.
