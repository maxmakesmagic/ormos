Hello and welcome to Rebound Week here on **magicthegathering.com**. Last week I examined the possibility of Enchantress in Standard. A lot of readers were very excited about the return of Enchantress.

This week I'd like to see what I can do with [Surreal Memoir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surreal+Memoir). I received an overwhelming email response last week. People have a lot of plans for their [Surreal Memoir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surreal+Memoir)s. Most people suggested that I try to build a [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) deck that abuses the rebound mechanic.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab92_meoir.jpg)  
[Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) has always been near and dear to my heart. I love a solid combo deck and [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) lets me combo off like an Extended deck in Standard. The rebound mechanic has obvious synergy with my [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). I get 2 counters on my [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) if I have a copy of the rebound spell already in my graveyard when I cast the second copy.

| Surreal Memoir | Pyromancer Ascension |

I decided to build a [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) deck for Standard. I scoured [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx) for a few hours and eventually I was able to put together a list that I was happy with.

I'll start by explaining all my card choices:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab92_theCardsHeader.jpg)  
[Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) is one of the best cantrips available in Standard. [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) helps us accelerate our mana and draws us a card. A deck like this wants to sift through its library as fast as possible. I've always been happy with [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) in this type of strategy and I figured it would fit well in this type of deck.

[Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow) is a great way to fix our mana. I'm being a little ambitious playing a 4 color deck with only 22 lands, but cards like [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), and [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow) help me fix my mana. [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow) also does a great job of thinning out my library so I can be assured that I draw enough gas once I start going off.

[Naya Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Charm) seems like a homerun for this type of strategy. I can use the "tap all creatures target opponent controls" option if I need a [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog), I can kill one of my opponent's threats with the bolt option, or I can set up infinite turns with the [Regrowth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regrowth)option. How do I set up infinite turns? I'm glad you asked. Once I have an active [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) and a [Naya Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Charm) in the yard I can simply cast a [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp), copy it, use my extra turn to cast a [Naya Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Charm) returning the [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) from my graveyard to my hand, copy the [Naya Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Charm) returning [Naya Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Charm) from my graveyard to my hand, and take my next turn. Then I can just rinse and repeat as necessary to draw my entire library and have enough mana to cast a [Banefire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banefire) for half my opponent's life total. (The copy will finish them off.)

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab92_theCardsCross1.jpg)  
[Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) is the name of the game. A lot of your opponents may be packing cards like [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) or [Maelstrom Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse). It's important to stick an Ascension early and force your opponent to spend time dealing with that instead of getting proactive. You shouldn't have a problem controlling the game once you have enough land in play with this deck.

[Surreal Memoir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surreal+Memoir): This really pushes the deck into a pretty competitive place. The synergies this card creates are really impressive. Most people that have known me for a long time are aware that [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) is my favorite **Magic** card of all time; I first started winning sanctioned matches with a [Mirari's Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake) deck back when I was in high school. [Surreal Memoir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surreal+Memoir) is, often times, a [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) when it works in tandem with [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) or [Naya Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Charm). An active [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) really pushes this card over the top.

Surprisingly, though, [Surreal Memoir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surreal+Memoir) didn't turn out to be the best rebound spell I tested. [Survival Cache](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+Cache) instantly proved its worth to me. The extra life is an excellent bonus and the rebound makes this card into a [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination). I especially enjoy activating my Ascension with a single card.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab92_theCardsCross2.jpg)  
[Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) is actually the best card in the deck. I would have played 4 copies of this if it cost a bit less money. [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) buys us time, digs us deeper through our library, acts as a win condition in the late game, and if we ever have an active [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) in play, then our opponents are going to need a lot of help to win through this one.

[Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) may seem a little out of place, but [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) is actually quite good in a deck like this. Most creature decks these days don't put any non-creature pressure on us. A [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) simply buys us an extra turn and helps to preserve our life total so our [Survival Cache](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+Cache)s stay live.

[Banefire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banefire) is an obvious win condition of choice here. If you don't mind heavy thought you can simply chain enough turns to start looping your [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) with [Naya Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Charm) and finish your opponent off that way. Most of my readers prefer having a cheat spell that lets them win the game without having to take a math test, though, so this seemed like a good one-of inclusion.

I played a few games on **Magic Online** that I would like to share with you.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab92_vengevine.jpg)I won the play and kept [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds), [Jungle Shrine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Shrine), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog), [Survival Cache](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+Cache), [Surreal Memoir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surreal+Memoir). I played my [Jungle Shrine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Shrine) and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) and passed the turn back. I drew a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), cast [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and passed the turn back. I drew a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), played my [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), cast [Survival Cache](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+Cache), going to 22 and drawing another [Survival Cache](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+Cache), and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Stirring Wildwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood) and used the extra [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) mana to power out a [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). He attacked for 2 and passed the turn. I went back to 22 on my upkeep and drew a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and a [Banefire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banefire). I decided to clear my opponent's board and I cast the [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) on my opponent's [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) and the [Banefire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banefire) for one on my opponent's [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra). My opponent cast a [Cunning Sparkmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage), played an [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds), and passed the turn. I drew a [Surreal Memoir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surreal+Memoir), cast [Survival Cache](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+Cache), going to 24, drawing a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), and putting a counter on my [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). I played my land and cast [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), I left [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and [Naya Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Charm) on the top of my library, drew one of the lands, and passed the turn with one green mana open. My opponent pinged me down to twenty three on my end step. My opponent cast a [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine) and tried to attack me for 4, I was ready with a [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog), though, and my opponent was forced to passed the turn. During my upkeep I went back up to 25, drew the [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and activated my [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). I drew the [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp), cast [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp), copied it, and took my first extra turn. I drew a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), cast it with the copy, saw three lands, shuffled my library, and drew a [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow), the second copy revealed a [Surreal Memoir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surreal+Memoir) and 2 lands, so I went for the shuffle again. I found another [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) and grabbed it. I cast [Naya Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Charm) with the copy and returned a [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) and a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) back to my hand. I took my next turn. Drew a [Seaside Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seaside+Citadel), cast [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow), copied it, cast [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp), copied it, and cast [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) with a copy, the first [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) found my second [Naya Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Charm) and I was then able to take infinite turns. Once my opponent saw the process by which I looped the [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) he or she conceded immediately.

My opponent played a [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and passed. I popped the [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) on his end step and found an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island).

I drew a [Seaside Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seaside+Citadel), cast [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), kept [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), and [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow) on top in that order. I played the [Seaside Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seaside+Citadel), cast a [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), and passed the turn.

I drew the ponder, cast [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow) to smooth out my mana, cast the second [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), cast [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), putting a counter on the [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) and kept [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp), [Naya Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Charm), in that order, I played my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and tapped out to cast a [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), all my nonexistent creatures had to attack.

I began my second turn with a pair of copied upkeep [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow)s, [Surreal Memoir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surreal+Memoir) resolved again and I got another [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow) in my hand.

This deck seems like it can do pretty well if it draws its [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). [Maelstrom Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) and [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) are problems that need to be dealt with, but you can often wait for the turn you plan to combo before you cast the [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). The deck has enough thinning and card selection to find an Ascension with more consistency than your opponent has answers. I'd be worried about control decks that play a good number of counterspells in their main deck alongside [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring)s. The sideboard should probably include a full play set of [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) to help the [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) problem. [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) is also a good sideboard option that helps us fight [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring)s. I've thought about a lot of strategies against control decks. Perhaps [Reality Spasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Spasm) can be our [Gigadrowse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigadrowse), perhaps we simply need to fight counterwars. Jund can be a problem, [Maelstrom Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) and [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning) can both be pretty obnoxious. [Swerve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swerve) may be the best war to fight [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning), and [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) or [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) can help on both fronts. 

If you're looking for a fun deck that can do some serious work against the top tier decks in Standard then Surreal Ascension may be the deck for you!

Happy Rebound Week!
