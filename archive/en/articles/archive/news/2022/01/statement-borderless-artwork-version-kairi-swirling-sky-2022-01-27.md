It has come to our attention that on the printed borderless version of "Kairi, the Swirling Sky" from *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty*, the artist credit was incorrectly listed as ゾウノセ/ZOUNOSE in all languages. The correct artist credit is ヨシヤ/YOSHIYA. The correct attribution will appear on *Magic: The Gathering Arena*.
