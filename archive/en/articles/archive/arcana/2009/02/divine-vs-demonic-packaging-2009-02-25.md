We're only a couple of months away from the release of *Duel Decks: Divine vs. Demonic*!

As you no doubt remember from [our announcement last December](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1737), it's coming out on April 10. We didn't show you the box back then. That was so we could show it to you now!

That is a lovely display box! We mention that because the people who design the display boxes do a lot of work and hardly ever get mentioned. Let's take one of those boxes out and get a good look at it!

Very nice! It's both divine ... and *demonic*.

Oh! And stop by again on Friday for a special *Divine vs. Demonic* surprise!
