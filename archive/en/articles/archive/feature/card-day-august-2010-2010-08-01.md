Card of the Day - August, 2010

By Wizards of the Coast











![Sachi, Daughter of Seshiro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sachi%2C+Daughter+of+Seshiro)**[Sachi, Daughter of Seshiro](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sachi%2C+Daughter+of+Seshiro)** – *Champions of Kamigawa* uncommon. The introduction of Snakes as a playable tribe (as opposed to just an unrelated group of creatures) meant that for the first time, players could look forward to drafting an entire family. In [2005 GP Leipzig](/en/events/coverage/rustam-leaves-leipzig-ruins), Niki Jedlicka successfully drafted [Seshiro the Anointed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seshiro+the+Anointed), along with two [Sachi, Daughter of Seshiro](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sachi%2C+Daughter+of+Seshiro) and [Sosuke, Son of Seshiro](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sosuke%2C+Son+of+Seshiro) for the full Snake set!
 ![Grand Arbiter Augustin IV](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grand+Arbiter+Augustin+IV)**[Grand Arbiter Augustin IV](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Arbiter+Augustin+IV)** – *Dissension* rare. Although [Grand Arbiter Augustin IV](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Arbiter+Augustin+IV) is presumably the fourth Augustin, he was only the second Arbiter in **Magic**. The first one was [Silent Arbiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Arbiter) in *Fifth Dawn*. Thanks to [Arbiter of Knollridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbiter+of+Knollridge) and [Angelic Arbiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Arbiter), there are now four Arbiters. Augustin was just ahead of his time.
 ![Timber Wolves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Timber+Wolves)**[Timber Wolves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timber+Wolves)** – *Alpha* rare. Rare? Yeah, it has banding. Oh. Can you explain banding without looking at Gatherer? Probably not, but then I'm guessing you can't explain a 4-Out 1-In Motion Offense either ....
 ![North Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=North+Star)**[North Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=North+Star)** – *Legends* rare. You might have forgotten about this mana-filtering artifact, since it was released in 1994. Or was it 1993? With [North Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=North+Star) you can cast that [Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus), [Coalition Victory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Victory), or [Sliver Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen) with mana of any color. Just remember you'll have to pay that extra four colorless to activate it. 
 ![Lovisa Coldeyes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lovisa+Coldeyes)**[Lovisa Coldeyes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lovisa+Coldeyes)** – *Coldsnap* rare. Legendary leader of the Balduvian tribes, [Lovisa Coldeyes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lovisa+Coldeyes) has it out for the "ice wizards," sports a rare Baulduvian-blonde mop of hair, drinks from a punch-bowl-sized goblet, and could cut through any pack of rivals with that axe of hers.
 ![Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Splinter+Twin)**[Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* rare. [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) features a single human female that creates, and I quote the art description here, "her wild-eyed double." With [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) in play, you'd triple her.
 ![Lake of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lake+of+the+Dead)**[Lake of the Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lake+of+the+Dead)** – *Alliances* rare. Turn three, tap a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), play [Lake of the Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lake+of+the+Dead), sacrifice the tapped swamp, tap your second [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), activate [Lake of the Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lake+of+the+Dead), sacrifice your second tapped [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), then tap [Lake of the Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lake+of+the+Dead) to add 4 more black mana to your mana pool for a total of 6. Is it good math? I don't know, because next turn you’ll have 4 black mana at best, if you draw, play, and sacrifice another [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp). Just hope no one [Annex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Annex) this land from you after all that.
 ![Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tooth+and+Nail)**[Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail)** – *Mirrodin* rare. They say you should never play an extremely expensive spell unless it's going to win you the game. That's usually what [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) does, so even though it's a seven-mana sorcery, it has a long and distinguished history of dominating tournament play.
 ![Knucklebone Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Knucklebone+Witch)**[Knucklebone Witch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knucklebone+Witch)** – *Lorwyn* rare. The art for [Knucklebone Witch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knucklebone+Witch) can be seen, in all its creepy glory, in [this arcana](/en/articles/archive/when-art-arrives-2008-12-31), which shows what the Creative department looks like when a lot of original art comes in at once.
 ![Lifeline](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lifeline)**[Lifeline](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifeline)** – *Urza's Saga* rare. Some cards just cry out to be used in abusive combos. Other cards require more work. And then there's [Lifeline](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifeline), which is so combo-ready, it's actually more of a challenge to come up with a way to use it that *isn't* broken in some weird way!
 ![Burning Palm Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Burning+Palm+Efreet)**[Burning Palm Efreet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Palm+Efreet)** – *Mirage* uncommon. Theme decks didn't exist when *Mirage* was created, which presented a problem when **Magic Online** started selling *Mirage*. So new theme decks were created in a variety of ways, including [on this very website](/en/articles/archive/you-make-mirage-theme-deck-2005-10-06). And that's how [Burning Palm Efreet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Palm+Efreet) got to be in a [theme deck](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/displaythemedeck.asp?set=mirage&decknum=1&lang=en) eight years after it was printed!
 ![Stonehands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stonehands)**[Stonehands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonehands)** – *Ice Age* common. The flavor text on [Stonehands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonehands) is spoken by [Lovisa Coldeyes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lovisa+Coldeyes), who would get her own card years later in *Coldsnap*. So there's still hope, [Granite Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Granite%2BGargoyle)!
 ![Zodiac Snake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zodiac+Snake)**[Zodiac Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zodiac+Snake)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* common. The [Zodiac creatures of *Portal Three Kingdoms*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?name=+%5Bzodiac%5D) represent a very unusual cycle: seven commons, four uncommons, one rare. Three black, three red, six green. All but one of them has some form of landwalk. But here's something neat: their twelve flavor texts tell the story of the set! That is, if you know the right order.
 ![Goldmeadow Dodger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goldmeadow+Dodger)**[Goldmeadow Dodger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow+Dodger)** – *Lorwyn* common. Goldmeadow has [Goldmeadow Dodger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Goldmeadow%2BDodger), [Goldmeadow Harrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Goldmeadow%2BHarrier), [Goldmeadow Lookout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Goldmeadow%2BLookout), and [Goldmeadow Stalwart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Goldmeadow%2BStalwart). Wondering what else goes on there? You can learn all about Goldmeadow in [this Savor the Flavor](/en/node/622491) from 2007.
 ![Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mountain)**[Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)** – *Arabian Nights* common. The answer to the trivia question "What is the commonest basic land?" is "Mountain," thanks to its inclusion on the *Arabian Nights* common sheet. Fascinating!
 ![Boldwyr Heavyweights](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Boldwyr+Heavyweights)**[Boldwyr Heavyweights](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boldwyr+Heavyweights)** – *Morningtide* rare. [Boldwyr Heavyweights](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boldwyr+Heavyweights) holds the distinction of being the biggest Giant in the game of **Magic**, although [Akron Legionnaire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akron+Legionnaire) has as much power. And for once, we don't need to clarify by saying "not counting Changelings," because [Changeling Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Titan) is only 7/7! 
 ![Monk Realist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Monk+Realist)**[Monk Realist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monk+Realist)** – *Urza's Saga* common. At two mana, the [Monk Realist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monk+Realist) destroys enchantments. But sometimes, the uncommon three-mana [Monk Idealist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monk+Idealist) comes along and brings the enchantment back out of the graveyard. The lesson? These monks should get together and decide on a plan ahead of time.
 ![Reknit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reknit)**[Reknit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reknit)** – *Shadowmoor* uncommon. In what appears to be a rare case of an *accidental* hidden message in a **Magic** card's name, *Shadowmoor*'s "[Reknit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reknit)" is "[Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)" spelled backwards—a fact that has, well, nothing whatsoever to do with the infamous card [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker).
 ![Reassembling Skeleton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reassembling+Skeleton)**[Reassembling Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reassembling+Skeleton)** – ***Magic** 2011* uncommon. **Magic**'s original bony buddies, [Drudge Skeletons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge+Skeletons), executed on the flavor of fantasy skeletons using the regenerate mechanic, which also appeared on creatures as diverse as [Sedge Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sedge%2BTroll) and [Will-o'-the-Wisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Will-o%2527-the-Wisp). [Reassembling Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reassembling+Skeleton) delivers more directly on the flavor of, well, reassembling.
 ![Reflecting Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reflecting+Pool)**[Reflecting Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflecting+Pool)** – *Shadowmoor* rare. Originally printed in *Tempest*, [Reflecting Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflecting+Pool) reappeared in *Shadowmoor* with the [*Lorwyn* Vivid lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5Bvivid%5D&set=%7C%5B%22lorwyn%22%5D) and [*Shadowmoor* hybrid lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&type=+%5Bland%5D&text=+%5B/%5D+%5B%29%5D&set=%7C%5B%22shadowmoor%22%5D%7C%5B%22eventide%22%5D) to play with. The pool shown on the *Shadowmoor* version reflects a vision of a very different place indeed: the sunny plane of Lorwyn, idyllic counterpart to the creepy twilit world of Shadowmoor.
 ![Relentless Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Relentless+Rats)**[Relentless Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relentless+Rats)** – ***Magic** 2011* uncommon. On Twitter recently, director of **Magic** R&D Aaron Forsythe (@[mtgaaron](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron)) posed the question: "How many [Relentless Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relentless+Rats) are in a playset?" Answers ranged, rather unhelpfully, from 0 to infinity, but our favorite answer came from @[MikeXIV](http://twitter.com/MikeXIV): "There are 2 playsets of relentless rats on the planet - every paper copy and every MTGO copy."
 ![Reverberate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reverberate)**[Reverberate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverberate)** – ***Magic** 2011* rare. Based on the flavor of [Fork](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Fork), red has had the ability to copy spells from the very beginning. *Saviors of Kamigawa*'s [Twincast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twincast) moved the cleanest version of that ability to blue, but with ***Magic** 2011* and [Reverberate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverberate), red takes it back—this time, without that goofy "the copy is red" text from [Fork](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fork). The cosmic ballet goes on ....
