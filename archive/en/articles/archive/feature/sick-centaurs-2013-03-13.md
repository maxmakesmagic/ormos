This is Nils Hamm's [Illness in the Ranks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illness+in+the+Ranks) from *Gatecrash*.

These poor centaurs appear to have been stricken by some sort of horrible disease. Do they look a little familiar?Â

It's the centaurs from [Coursers' Accord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coursers%27+Accord), also illustrated by Nils Hamm, from *Return to Ravnica*! That's what happens when you summon tokens into a world ravaged by anti-token plagues. On the upside, though, those centaurs probably aren't dead. They're just taking a little rest because they're not used to being only 2/2.
