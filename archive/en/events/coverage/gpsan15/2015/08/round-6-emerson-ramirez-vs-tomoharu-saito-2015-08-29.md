5 Pro Tour Top 8s, including a win at Pro Tour Charleston in 2006. 20 Grand Prix Top 8s, including 4 wins. Tomoharu Saito should need no introduction. His opponent was Emerson Ramirez, a local player well known in the community, and who represented Chile at Worlds in 2007. Ramirez won the die roll and elected to play.


**Game 1**


Ramirez was off to a flying start, with a [Subterranean Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Subterranean+Scout) on the ground and a [Vryn Wingmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vryn+Wingmare) in the air. Saito stalled the ground forces with a [Akroan Sergeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Sergeant), but a [Charging Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charging+Griffin) from Ramirez kept the pressure up in the air.


Saito summoned a [Ghirapur Gearcrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghirapur+Gearcrafter), planning on shutting the Wingmare down. Ramirez assessed the speed of his assault and decided to use a [Suppression Bonds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suppression+Bonds) on the token, continuing the air raids.

While Saito managed to stabilise the ground forces, Ramirez continued to pummel him in the air. Eventually an [Infectious Bloodlust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infectious+Bloodlust) on the winged horse forced the concession from Saito.

**Game 2**


Saito, on the play, was on the front foot with two early [Ghirapur Gearcrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghirapur+Gearcrafter)s. One traded with a [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade) from Ramirez, who then played a [Ghirapur Gearcrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghirapur+Gearcrafter) of his own. Saito summoned a [Hitchclaw Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hitchclaw+Recluse). Ramirez swung into it with a [Ghirapur Gearcrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghirapur+Gearcrafter). Saito, sensing a trick, eventually decided to block. The Gearcrafter died, but in his second main phase Ramirez called a [Meteorite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meteorite) down from the sky to smite the spider. It wasn't meant to be, as Saito saved his arachnid with a [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth).


Saito called an [Outland Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outland+Colossus) onto the battlefield, which Ramirez quickly neutralized using [Suppression Bonds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suppression+Bonds). Ramirez tried to stablise with an [Aven Battle Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Battle+Priest). Saito, having none of it, summoned a [Volcanic Rambler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Rambler). Ramirez cast an [Abbot of Keral Keep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abbot+of+Keral+Keep), flipping a [Celestial Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Flare).


“Fine!” said Saito.


“Not so fine.” joked Ramirez.


“Sorry,” replied Saito, “Unlucky.”


Over the next few turns the [Volcanic Rambler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Rambler) and a [Prickleboar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prickleboar) picked off Ramirez life total until the local conceded.


“That spider had to die for me to win.” Ramirez sighed.

**Game 3**


Ramirez mulliganed to six, the look on his face as he kept showing deep concern. He played out a turn two [Subterranean Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Subterranean+Scout), but a [Dragon Fodder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Fodder) in response by Saito made the Chilean groan aloud.


When Ramirez missed his next land drop, Saito moved firmly into the driver's seat, summoning a [Dwynen's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwynen%27s+Elite), [Pharika's Disciple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Disciple), and an [Embermaw Hellion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermaw+Hellion) in quick succession. Ramirez did his best to fight them off, but his powerless [Yoked Ox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yoked+Ox) and a [Ghirapur Gearcrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghirapur+Gearcrafter) were lackluster in the face of Saito's raw power.


When Saito summoned a [Woodland Bellower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Bellower), Ramirez appeared ready to pack it in. But Saito made a mistake, using the Bellower's ability to tutor up a [Nissa, Vastwood Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Vastwood+Seer). Saito was stopped by the judge; the Bellower could not fetch a Legendary creature. Saito was given a warning, his first for the tournament.


Regardless, it was too little too late for Ramirez, who tried to rally a comeback with a [War Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Oracle), only to find it dead to a [Wild Instincts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Instincts) from Saito. Ramirez extended the hand and it was all over.
