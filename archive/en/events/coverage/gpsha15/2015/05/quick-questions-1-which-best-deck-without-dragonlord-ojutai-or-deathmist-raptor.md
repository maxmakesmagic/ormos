**Platinum Pro & Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* finalist, Nam Sung Wook:** Abzan Aggro. It is difficult to metagame against it and every matchup is 50/50 at worst.

**11 Grand Prix Top 8s, Tzu Ching Kuo:** Abzan Control. The decks with [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) and [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) are not super powerful in the first place.
