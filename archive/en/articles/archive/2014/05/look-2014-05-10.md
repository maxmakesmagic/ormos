*Need heroes? We got heroes.*

  



*We even have [Ajani, Mentor of Heroes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Mentor+of+Heroes)!* 

  



*Is mono-red a thing now?* 

  



*Black devotion apparently still is a thing ...* 

  



*... and is newly joined by devotion to black and white.* 

  



*Awesome red-white is awesome!* 

  



*A storm is coming â€¦ Or three!*
