WIZARDS OF THE COAST PLANS LARGEST-EVER *MAGIC: THE GATHERING*® TOURNAMENT TO CELEBRATE GAME’S 10TH ANNIVERSARY AND RELEASE OF NEW CORE SET


*Worldwide tournament to be held at 2,000 locations this summer*


**April 9, 2003 (Renton, Wash.)** – Wizards of the Coast, Inc., a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc. (NYSE: HAS), today announced it will host a global **Magic: The Gathering®** tournament, inviting **Magic®** players and Wizards’ retail partners worldwide to participate in a 10th anniversary celebration for the premier trading card game. The global event, slated for July 26-27, coincides with the planned release of the new **Magic: The Gathering [Core Set™](/en/articles/archive/core-set-2003-03-31)** and the GenCon game fair.


More than 2,000 official **Magic** tournament organizers and tens of thousands of players across the world are expected to participate in the event. “We hope to set a record for the largest **Magic** tournament and perhaps the largest trading card game tournament ever held,” commented Chris Galvin, Director of Organized Play at Wizards of the Coast. “One of the things that sets the **Magic** game apart is its global community of players, and we wanted to give players everywhere a fun way to participate in the 10th anniversary celebration.”


The 10th anniversary global celebration event will feature cards from the new **Magic: The Gathering Core Set**. In this Limited format tournament, players will build their decks upon arriving at the tournament locations. Each player will receive a special commemorative premium card from the new **Core Set** for participating in the global celebration event, while supplies last.

The **Magic: The Gathering** game, invented by Richard Garfield and first released in 1993, today is available in 52 countries and nine languages, with more than 100,000 official tournaments sanctioned each year by the **DCI®** players’ organization.
