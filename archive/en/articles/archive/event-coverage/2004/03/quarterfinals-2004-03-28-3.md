### Game 1


Game 1 was a long affair with both players trading cards and looking for a way to break through. Craig found his answer with a combination of [Fangren Firstborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Firstborn) and [One Dozen Eyes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+Dozen+Eyes) as the finisher.


### Game 2


Brock opened with a [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) and followed with a [Slith Bloodletter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Bloodletter) while all Krempels had a [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) that wasn't going to be blocking. He played a third turn [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) and slowed down Brock's quick beats. 


"Must attack…" Krempels sent his [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) into a double block but had [Predator's Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%27s+Strike) to take out the Disciple and do a little trample damage to boot. Brock got in for two more with his Slith and played a [Serum Tank](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank). He rubbed his temples and thought about he best way to use his remaining two mana. He finally decided to keep it open and passed the turn.


![Fangren Firstborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fangren+Firstborn)
Craig attacked for five and passed the turn with a Spider lurking in hand. Brock played an [Aether Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb) and passed the turn and Craig made the Spider. He untapped and cast [Wurmskin Forger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmskin+Forger) and spread his counters around to everyone but the Spider. He attacked with [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) and the Spider. Brock bounced the artifact and [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)ed the Spider. 


He drew a [Serum Tank](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank) card on his turn and passed with his Slith on guard duty. Craig played the [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) and a Vulshok Battelgear but did not attack. Brock dug for a card on his turn and looked for a way to deal with three creatures next turn. He had a [Nuisance Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nuisance+Engine) and he played it with the necessary mana to use it but not also be able to regenerate the Slith.


Craig equipped the [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) and sent everyone into combat. The 2/2 Myr was eaten by the Slith and a token stepped in the way of the [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut). Craig cast journey of Discovery for two lands. Brock dug for more cards and played a [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot). He had the mana to activate both his Engine and his Slith's regeneration and Craig's [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) was contractually obligated to bounce off of the 3/3 Slith.


Brock's next dip into the [Serum Tank](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank) allowed him to play a [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica) and when he passed the turn, Craig flashed out his second Spider. Only his [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) attacked and Brock debated his blocks. He just elected to bounce it off of his Slith. He made another token at the end of his turn. His digging yielded a [Sun Droplet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Droplet) and a [Vedalken Engineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Engineer) on the next turn.


This continued until Brock had dug deep enough into his deck to find [Memnarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch). When he played him he had thirteen lands, Ingot and two [Vedalken Engineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Engineer)s in play. Now it was Craig's turn to dig. He drew five cards with a [Promise of Power](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promise+of+Power) and there was nothing of any help. 


### Game 3


Brock opened with a Disciple on the draw and again had one of his two [Slith Bloodletter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Bloodletter)s. Brock got in for three next turn but he was missing a third land. Craig's [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) stared Brock down at the end of turn four. The Pro Tour winner found his third land and debated his play. He played an Engineer and braced for five from the [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut). 


Craig followed his mandatory attack with a [Tel-Jilad Outrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Outrider). Brock's land troubles were behind him now and he played land number four. He sent his Slith into the red zone and Craig had to decide if losing his guy was worth tying up Brock's mana. He opted to do so but now Brock had plenty and played [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) and a second Engineer. Craig came across for five more and made five 1/1 tokens with his [One Dozen Eyes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+Dozen+Eyes). 


Brock summoned a [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica) and another Slith. The Replica took out the [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) and Craig took two from the Disciple's ability. He cast [Journey of Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+of+Discovery) and an [Iron Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr). The Myr blocked the newer Slith next turn and was augmented with a [Battlegrowth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlegrowth). Brock had a [Spawning Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawning+Pit) and also cast [Nim Lasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Lasher).


![Spawning Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spawning+Pit)
There was some risk that Brock could just kill him between the Disciple and the [Spawning Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawning+Pit) but it was probably a couple of turns off since none of his creatures were artifacts to begin with.  
 Craig talked to his deck, "C'mon [Promise of Power](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promise+of+Power)." He was rewarded with the card he wanted and he was able to entwine it for a 6/6 flier. He fell to ten from the lost life. 


Brock sent his Lasher to attack and it traded with a token and he put a counter on the Pit. He had no other play and passed the turn. Craig flew over for six and then dumped out a [Grimclaw Bats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grimclaw+Bats), [Copper Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr), and [Viridian Joiner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Joiner). 


Brock had one card in hand…it was [Essence Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Drain). He drew for his turn and searched for an out that he might be missing. He looked to the pile of coins by his deck sure that was some way to extricate himself but the math did not come out in his favor. He finally tried to buy one more turn by [Essence Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Drain)ing the [Grimclaw Bats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grimclaw+Bats) and he crept up to seven life. 


Craig had a [Vulshok Battlegear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear) and attacked for nine and the win.


**Final result:** Craig Krempels -2 Brock Parker - 1
