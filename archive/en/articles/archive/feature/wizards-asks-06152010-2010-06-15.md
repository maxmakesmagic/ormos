*When you're playing [Archenemy](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/archenemy/productinfo), would you rather be the archenemy or one of the heroes? Why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_tomlapille.jpg)**Tom LaPille:** For me, it all depends on how well the heroes are cooperating. One of my two favorite things to do in Archenemy is to be part of a team of heroes that operates as a well-oiled machine, combining cards and attacks to get the most out of all of the team's cards. That kind of teamwork can go a long way to overcoming an archenemy's scheme cards, even when the team's cards don't look individually menacing.

My other favorite thing, though, is when I am the archenemy and I get to watch the heroes trip all over each other and fail to combine their cards effectively. It is especially delightful when I see on-board mistakes that the team makes, and I get to cackle to myself with glee at how silly they are. If the team is cooperating well, I'd rather be on the team; if not, I want to be the bad guy!
