Oh the things that are possible in Vintage. Between the power nine, [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids), [Mishra's Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop), and [Bazaar of Baghdad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad), there are some incredibly cool things that you can see watching these matches.


You've got all of the power, which is incredibly cool to see in play...

The eternal struggle between Dredge and graveyard hate...

Which is much better than the eternal struggle between Dredge and Dredge...

*I'm not even touching this one. You figure this board state out...* 
  

 


And far more typical than the eternal struggle between Dredge and...Myr...

*Actually, I kinda like this one.* 
  

 


Though making Myr isn't the only thing you can do with artifacts in Vintage. Most of the decks featuring the powerful [Mishra's Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) try to lock opponents out of the game, using cards like [Sphere of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Resistance) and [Thorn of Amethyst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thorn+of+Amethyst) to make everything cost a million mana...

*Wait...you mean my Moxes cost me how much to play?!* 
  

 


They can also lock people out of the game with [Smokestack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokestack)...



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/eternal13/stax.jpg)
  
*Answering the age old question of whether or not artifacts burn. The answer is yes. And so do Islands, creatures, enchantments (don't ask me), Planeswalkers (even Chandra)...* 
  

 


If you get the right ones together, you can screw these soft locks and just completely lock them out of the game. Interesting that one of the biggest parts of the lock is a key...



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/eternal13/combo.jpg)
  
*Or a Tezzeret... He's the night janitor at the [Time Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault).* 
  

 


Most of the reason that these artifact decks are so good is because of the prevalence of cheap spells in this format. It's also the reason that a card as narrow as [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep) is such a defining card in this format...



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/eternal13/misstep.jpg)
  
*[Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep)—Stronger than [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall).* 
  

 


Although it can't stop another of the marquee cards of Vintage—[Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids). With access to cards like [Forbidden Orchard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Orchard) and [Swan Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swan+Song), which give opponents creatures, you can effectively control whether or not you get to Oath! Now, you have all of the creatures ever printed at your disposal, all of the magic of the multiverse at your fingertips. What do you use to kill your opponent?

*Hint: It's not ants.* 
  

 


Although others prefer a more sinister approach...



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/eternal13/oath3.jpg)
  
*It's cool. We're working on a vaccine.* 
  

 


Whatever you choose, you're sure to have an immense amount of fun playing with all of these high-powered Vintage cards. If you're worried about being able to get your hands on the cards (they are fairly hard to come by), talk to your local store owner or TO about hosting a proxy tournament! They're not able to be sanctioned, but they're a great way to enjoy Vintage fun and get a chance to experience this unique, incredibly rich format!
