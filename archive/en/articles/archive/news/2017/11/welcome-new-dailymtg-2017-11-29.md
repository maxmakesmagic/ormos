Welcome to the new DailyMTG! It probably looks a little bit different than you're used to.


Look around, put up your feet, make yourself at home, and explore a bit. We've got a lot of new features and ways to keep you in the loop. If you haven't already, check out [the article where I discuss the new site's features and functions](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/new-dailymtg-2017-11-09). Pretty much everything I said there still holds true.


What I want to walk you through today is more of our philosophy for how we picture this page moving forward, how we can help you find what you're looking for, and what keeps my hair so luxuriously great (okay, maybe not that last part).


Your Knowledgeable *Magic* Friend
=================================


At the beginning of 2017, my team was asked to figure out who we were—a sort of overarching philosophy for the DailyMTG crew. It took some research, some hand-wringing, some chatter over Commander games, and some deep soul-searching (read: not that deep), but what we came up with exemplifies what we want DailyMTG to be going forward:




---

We're your super-helpful *Magic* friend who knows everyone at the party and can help connect you with other super-helpful *Magic* friends.




---

I believe the original description was "cool, super-helpful *Magic* friend," but, let's be realistic. I stopped being cool when I was approximately three years old. And even then . . .


But the point is that we are best at guiding players through the community, delivering news, and giving you information you can only get from Wizards of the Coast. Basically, we're pretty good at welcoming you to the party and introducing you around ("Hey, have you met Meghan and Maria? And you definitely need to talk to Prof. Dev's over there on the couch with his cat. He's cool.") and then sharing some inside info ("Psst, hey. We're about to put out the good punch—you know, the *Innistrad* stuff.").


What we're *not* great at is telling you how to be *good* at *Magic*. True story, even if we don't say it out loud very often. We can certainly help you get *better* (Gavin Verhey's Beyond the Basics is all about that), but top-level strategy? That's best left to the pros.


And that's where we started to recognize that **the community's best content creators are its fans**. When DailyMTG was first created, we were, more or less, the only show in town. Most *Magic* sites were mainly forums, and only The Dojo (raise your hand if you're old and remember that one) really had a major presence in the content game.


These days, there are dozens of high-quality sites, podcasts, and YouTube channels that can teach you about the game, help you explore it, show you how to get better, highlight cool tidbits, and gush about the art. StarCityGames.com, ChannelFireball, and TCGplayer have the literal best players in the world producing strategy content for them on a daily basis. Gathering Magic, The Command Zone, Magic the Amateuring, and MTGGoldfish consistently produce fun, relevant content. Hipsters of the Coast, Magic Mics, and Mana Deprived bring you all the news that's fit to print, talk about, or record. And these great sources are just the tip of the iceberg!


So our goal, and the philosophy around with the new DailyMTG is built, is that we can show you around the wide, amazing world of *Magic* content and let those fine folks take it from there.


The Inside Story
================


That said, we will, of course, still be producing our own content, but we're going to focus on where our strengths lie—information you can't get anywhere else.


That means Making *Magic* from Mark Rosewater, *Magic* Story from our story team, Play Design from R&D, art insights from our art teams, developing news, product announcements, previews, ahead-of-schedule analysis, and more will make up the backbone of what we do.


But we will also be a hub of information for everything and anything under the sun. The Daily *Magic* Update is the model, and now we're moving that to the front page. That means no more having to dive into an article to find cool content for the day—it'll be right there, front and center on DailyMTG.


Want the Top Stories of the day? That'll be right at the, um, top.


Want to know what events are coming up? The information tabs will guide you.


Want to watch the latest videos or community-made streams? Top Videos has got your back.


Want to read the entire block's *Magic* Story so far? The story block has you covered end-to-end.


And so on, and so forth.


Come on In, the Water's Fine
============================


The best thing is that the page is flexible and I'll be taking in constant feedback. You can always email us at [newmagicwebsite@wizards.com](mailto:newmagicwebsite@wizards.com), or message me on Twitter [@blakepr](https://twitter.com/blakepr). Reader feedback helped shape this new venture, and it will continue to help shape and hone it moving forward.


So we invite you to come check us out, look around, and then make your way out into the wider world of *Magic*'s content creators. Trust us—they're cool.
