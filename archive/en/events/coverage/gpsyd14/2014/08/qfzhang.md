 In the distant past, James Zhang was a force to be reckoned with in the Australian *Magic* scene, winning GP Melbourne in 2005, and running it back at GP Sydney in 2006. Park Jun Young on the other hand, arrived with a top 8 at GP Kitakyushu in 2007, before finally clocking up a second top 8 in Kuala Lumpur and a win in Minneapolis earlier this year.




 Park's White/Black deck developed early but Zhang come back over the top with a [Garruk, Apex Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Apex+Predator) he was fortunate to receive fifth pick in pack two. Park rebuilt with a [Divine Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor) on a [Rotfeaster Maggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotfeaster+Maggot), and Zhang was unable to muster anything to stop it.






*James Zhang is hoping to win his second GP Sydney in a decade.*
