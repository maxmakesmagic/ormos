The February 22, 2017 Update
============================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 22, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by Merfolk. Reluctantly.


Today's Must
============


1. [Commander Summit 2016 With Commanderin' and Commander's Brew](http://collected.company/2017/02/21/commander-summit-2017-commanderin-commanders-brew-147/) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

Yo, dawg, I hear you like Commander podcasts (and memes from ten years ago). How about I put a Commander podcast with your Commander podcast and have them go talk on a Commander podcast about Commander? Phil DeLuca of Commanderin' and Andy Hull from Commander's Brew join the Command Zone to talk about the state of Commander and what 2016 was like for everyone shuffling up 100 cards.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Episode 213: Get a Kluwe](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-episode-213-get-a-kluwe/) | Magic the Amateuring | Maria Bartholdi and Meghan Wolff

Chris Kluwe joins the Magic the Amateuring podcast to talk about *Magic*, inclusion, and designing games. But it doesn't really matter what he talks about in my book—I'm a major Vikings homer, so I'll show off pretty much anything a former Vikings player wants to chat about in the world of *Magic*.


1. [*Magic*'s E-sport Future—Interview with an Industry Veteran](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13819&writer=Corbin+Hosler&articledate=2-22-2017) | TCGPlayer | Corbin Hosler

This article was described to me as "Corbin being Corbin," which, if you've read his stuff, is a compliment. Here, Corbin Corbins all over this interview with an e-sports lawyer and *Magic* player to talk about the future of *Magic* as an e-sport.


And while we're Corbining about Corbin here (I'm pretty certain that doesn't make any sense), a belated happy birthday to said Corbin, who celebrated yesterday. Wish him a happy birthday on Twitter [@Chosler88](https://twitter.com/Chosler88). In his honor, I chose his favorite deck as the [Deck of the Day below](#11).


1. [Red-Black Rakdos Philosophy, Strengths, and Weaknesses: A *Magic: The Gathering* Color Pie Study!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFvSf7zYQPQ) | The Mana Source | Wedge

Some people just want to watch the world burn—and those people probably play Rakdos. Wedge delves into what makes Rakdos tick, what makes them tock, and what makes them go boom.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFvSf7zYQPQ>


1. [Counter Hype](http://manadeprived.com/hypeclub-7-counter-hype/) | Mana Deprived | Anthony Cameron and MattyStudios

The list of things discussed in this episode of Hype Club is impressive: two Modern Grand Prix, *Magic* Digital Next, full-art lands, *Modern Masters 2017 Edition*, and more (yes more!). And all in a brisk 65 minutes. That's how you podcast!


1. [Dear Azami: Taking Off the Blinders](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/02/taking-off-blinders/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Levi Byrne

Levi Byrne has taken up the Dear Azami mantle and taken it to Hipsters of the Coast after the series ended its run on StarCityGames.com. It's the same concept—readers send in decklists for the writer to tweak—just a different channel.


1. [White-Black Control in Standard](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/wb-control-in-standard/) | ChannelFireball | Reid Duke

Reid Duke attacks the established Standard metagame with a new brew that pairs the best removal with the best planeswalkers. He found some success with the list last weekend—maybe this is the deck to let control break back into Standard.


Top 25
======


1. Lee Shi Tian and Jiachen Tao move on up

Two players—Lee Shi Tian and Jiachen Tao—are the biggest winners this week, each moving up four spots to Nos. 9 and 15, respectively.


Jiachen Tao did it the easy way, emerging from a cluster of players who all had very similar point totals—he simply saw his yearly total rise just above theirs.


Lee Shi Tian, meanwhile, earned his spot in the Top 10 through a Top 8 at [Grand Prix Brisbane](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbri17). He's quietly been one of the most consistent pros over the past year, and with his spot among the ten best in the world, it's virtually undeniable now that he's among the best of the best.

What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. Magic Mics | [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics) | 11 p.m. ET/8 pm. PT | Reuben Bresler, Evan Erwin, and Erin Campbell

The gang talks Modern. At least I'm guessing. That's kind of on everyone's mind this week as we had two Modern Grand Prix last weekend and *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* previews start Monday. Seems appropriate. But it's their show, they'll talk about what they want to talk about—maybe Evan saw a really good movie or Erin has strong feelings about *The Good Place*. Only way to find out is to tune in tonight.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Fatherhood](http://cardboard-crack.com/post/157532040256/fatherhood) | Cardboard Crack

Oh, heck no! No child of mine . . .


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Jonathon Zaczek's Merfolk](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpvan17/top-8-decklists-2017-02-19)

Jonathon Zaczek nearly played [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) spoiler at [Grand Prix Vancouver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpvan17) last weekend with what is a relatively stock Merfolk list, but piloted expertly. With three other [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) decks in the Top 4 of the tournament, Zaczek and his fish made it to the finals before succumbing to Josh Utter-Leyton's Grand Prix of Destiny.


Still, it was an impressive run for a deck that doesn't get a ton of press in Modern. The deck uses [Æther Vial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) to cheat on mana, then disrupts opponents with [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas), [Cursecatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursecatcher), [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique), [Harbinger of the Tides](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbinger+of+the+Tides), and a few pointed sideboard cards, all while making 5/5 Merfolk with the plethora of lords the deck runs.


Plus, there's no better feeling than playing [Silvergill Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvergill+Adept) off an [Æther Vial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial). It just feels so very right.
