It's mid-August, the last third of summer here in Canada, and that can mean only two things: I have suddenly become a year older than usual, and the **Magic** players I know are banding with others (i.e. getting married). Last weekend, my friend tied the knot (Congrats, Todd and Trista!). A planned pre-wedding triple-*Invasion* draft was thwarted by a power outage, so the only magic that happened that night (besides the obvious) took place on the dance floor after dinner. There I was joined by the bridesmaids, my buddy Will, and Mr. "Jolly" Rogers, whose goals in life include getting namedropped in an article on this site and eventually settling down with a nice girl who loves playing Vintage (Well, at least one of those things is going to happen).

Normally, no amount of arm-twisting can get me out on to a dance floor, but after a brief, yet hilarious, pep talk from Will (which I won't repeat here), I took off my jacket, loosened my tie, rolled up my sleeves, and proceeded to shake what is, nominally, my groove thang. If you've ever seen *So You Think You Can Dance*, you will have a good idea of what I didn't look like. Rugs were cut, moves were busted, and, as far as I can tell, my reputation survived an embarrassing display that can be fairly accurately described as C-3PO crossed with a boxing kangaroo. Thankfully, my friend Alexander K. ensured that there would be no reliable witnesses.

While we're on the subject of well-matched people, I thought I would revisit an earlier wedding-themed column and talk about some other creatures that were meant to be together.

### Where's the BFF?

The last time I devoted [an article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/cm82) to all-creature combos, I limited myself to creatures that could be found in *Tenth Edition*, the most recent set at the time. Well, *Eventide* claims that title nowadays, so I'll be using creatures from that set, but to mix things up, I'll pick a second creature from whatever set I want. I'm whimsical like that.

**[Cloud of Faeries](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries) + [Dream Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Thief)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Cloud of Faeries | Dream Thief |

Here's a real humdinger. Picture this: It's turn three and you've just played your third [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). You then play Cloud of Faeries and untap two of those lands. Follow that up with [Dream Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Thief) and all of a sudden \*bam\* you've put your opponent on a seven-turn clock and you're up a card to boot! Now all you have to do is add some [Sprite Noble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprite+Noble)s to the mix and you've got the basis for that rarest of things: the Faerie tribal deck.

**[Marshdrinker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marshdrinker+Giant) + [Streambed Aquitects](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Streambed+Aquitects)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Marshdrinker Giant | Streambed Aquitects |

Another powerhouse. I don't know about you, but I find it rather annoying when I play a [Marshdrinker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marshdrinker+Giant) and nothing happens. With [Streambed Aquitects](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Streambed+Aquitects)' ability to make [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s out of everyday household materials (like [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s), you'll never have this problem again! There are many, many other creatures that perform this useful function, including [Tideshaper Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tideshaper+Mystic), [Reef Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reef+Shaman), [Dream Thrush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Thrush), [Moonbow Illusionist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonbow+Illusionist), [Sea Snidd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Snidd), [Dreamwinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder), [Floodchaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Floodchaser), and [Kukemssa Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kukemssa+Serpent). If you've got more of a hate-on for [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s (and only [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s), you can use [Kavu Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Recluse), [Orcish Farmer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Farmer), or [Zombie Trailblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Trailblazer). [Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg%2C+Tomb+of+Yawgmoth) and [Mystic Compass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Compass) offer nice, repeatable, non-creature ways to ensure that [Marshdrinker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marshdrinker+Giant) always hits. If you'd like to be able to drink the marshes turn after turn, go ahead and add something like [Vedalken Mastermind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Mastermind), [Stampeding Wildebeests](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Wildebeests), or [Cache Raiders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cache+Raiders).

**[Cache Raiders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cache+Raiders) + [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Cache Raiders | Avalanche Riders |

Or you could do it the easy way.

**[Indigo Faerie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indigo+Faerie) + [Jaya Ballard, Task Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jaya+Ballard%2C+Task+Mage)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Indigo Faerie | Jaya Ballard, Task Mage |

Since we're talking about repeatable land destruction, here's a "fun" little combo that allows you to turn ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) and a card into a makeshift [Vindicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate). Of course, you could have done this one set earlier with Jaya and [Painter's Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant) (or in a more limited way with [Scuttlemutt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scuttlemutt)), but that combo has actually been making (admittedly small) waves in Vintage, alongside [Red Elemental Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast) and [Grindstone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grindstone).

**[Hatchet Bully](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hatchet+Bully) + [Grim Poppet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Poppet)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Hatchet Bully | Grim Poppet |

These two are the Mickey and Mallory of *Shadowmoor* block creatures. [Hatchet Bully](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hatchet+Bully) provides repeatable [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)s as long as you can find somewhere to put a -1/-1 counter each time. [Grim Poppet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Poppet) supplies you with just such a place. [Leech Bonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leech+Bonder), [Quillspike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quillspike), [Deity of Scars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deity+of+Scars), [Chainbreaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainbreaker), [Morselhoarder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morselhoarder), and [Heartmender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartmender) either allow you to use the -1/-1 counters profitably or simply remove them at little cost. In perhaps the most unlikely alliance, [Hatchet Bully](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hatchet+Bully) and [Woeleecher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woeleecher) combine to make mini [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix)es for a mere ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)!

**[Woodlurker Mimic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodlurker+Mimic) + [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Woodlurker Mimic | Shambling Shell |

*Eventide*'s cycle of Mimics are all very powerful...as long as you can play a steady stream of gold or hybrid cards of the relevant colours. That isn't easy to do without a little assistance, which is just what [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell), and its dredge ability, provide. Once you've drawn both cards, you will be able to turn on your Mimic each turn by sacrificing the [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) and dredging it back. This has the added benefit of making your Mimic larger each time (Thanks, layer 6c!). [Grave-Shell Scarab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave-Shell+Scarab) provides some redundancy, and both Golgari creatures work well with [Savra, Queen of the Golgari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savra%2C+Queen+of+the+Golgari) (natch) to clear a path for your Mimic. [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) gives you an easy way to clear the counters off of [Noxious Hatchling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Hatchling) as well.

**[Wake Thrasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wake+Thrasher) + [Aphetto Alchemist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Alchemist)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Wake Thrasher | Aphetto Alchemist |

This one comes from two-time House of Cards guest columnist Noel deCordova. Sure, it's fun to pump [Wake Thrasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wake+Thrasher) to a double-digit power by untapping the lands you tapped last turn and by using the crazy untapping tricks enabled by [Merrow Reejerey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merrow+Reejerey). But those only allow you to attack with, like, a 10/10 on turn four. Why not "go infinite" with the use of one other card? [Seeker of Skybreak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+Skybreak) can be subbed in for, or used in conjunction with, [Aphetto Alchemist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Alchemist), and reader Alex R. noted that you can also make [Wake Thrasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wake+Thrasher) arbitrarily large with [Puresight Merrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresight+Merrow) and [Paradise Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradise+Mantle) (among other two- and three-card combos).

**[Spitemare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitemare) + [Volcano Hellion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcano+Hellion)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Spitemare | Volcano Hellion |

Perhaps the only "couple" where one partner must utterly destroy the other. I was going to say that it is just like [Stuffy Doll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy+Doll) and [Volcano Hellion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcano+Hellion) but playable in Standard, until I realized that [Stuffy Doll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy+Doll) is actually still in Standard (P.S. Standard is huge!). As with Stuffy (or [Mogg Maniac](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Maniac)), as long as you have more life than your opponent you can win on the spot by targeting your [Spitemare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitemare) with [Volcano Hellion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcano+Hellion)'s comes-into-play ability. The good thing about this combo is that it features many more tentacles.

**[Impelled Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Impelled+Giant) + [Okk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Okk)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Impelled Giant | Okk |

If there's one thing red creatures love more than barreling headlong into the red zone, it's not being able to do so because of some crippling psychological issue. How else can you explain this sad-sack bunch of excuse-makers? [Okk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Okk), [Orgg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orgg), [Veteran Brawlers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Brawlers), [Mijae Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mijae+Djinn), [Goblin Goon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Goon), [Lesser Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lesser+Gargadon)....

Suggested by Skander R., this combo allows you to take advantage of the above creatures' high power-to-cost ratio, even if you can't attack with the creatures themselves. [Veteran Brawlers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Brawlers) might be intimidated by an untapped [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), a situation that apparently hasn't come up in their many years of brawling, but at least you can tap them to pump your [Impelled Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Impelled+Giant). For the next deck, I'm going to go a step further and use red creatures that have even more difficulty attacking. That's right, I'm going to use Walls. Some, like [Wall of Razors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Razors) and [Blistering Barrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Barrier), have similarly high power-to-cost ratios, and a card like [Aetherflame Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflame+Wall) can give [Impelled Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Impelled+Giant) a sort of [Firebreathing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebreathing)-by-proxy.

Other interesting creatures to pair with [Impelled Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Impelled+Giant) include ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210430014038im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/untap.gif) cards like [Hateflayer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hateflayer) and [Duergar Mine-Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duergar+Mine-Captain) (but especially [Hateflayer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hateflayer)), and [Spitebellows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitebellows), which, when evoked, can take out a 6-toughness creature and sticks around long enough to give [Impelled Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Impelled+Giant) an additional +6/+0. I cribbed some Wall-deck tech from R&D's Kenneth Nagle and included two copies of [Kyren Negotiations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kyren+Negotiations) in the deck. They give your Walls something to do when they aren't busy blocking and it provides another tap-outlet for your ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210430014038im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/untap.gif) creatures. [Grab the Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins) and [Soulblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulblast) provide you with the means to avoid the combat step entirely, while [Illuminated Folio](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illuminated+Folio) keeps your non-threats flowing.

You could easily splash white in this deck for things like [Rolling Stones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Stones), [Wakestone Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wakestone+Gargoyle), and [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling)-meister [Brion Stoutarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brion+Stoutarm).

**[Primalcrux](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) + [Nacatl War-Pride](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nacatl+War-Pride)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Primalcrux | Nacatl War-Pride |

This one is only likely if you use [Defense of the Heart](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defense+of+the+Heart), [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail), or some kind of mass reanimation spell (say, [Pyrrhic Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrrhic+Revival)), if only because the cards cost so much. But, boy, will it make a huge [Primalcrux](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux)! You see, [Nacatl War-Pride](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nacatl+War-Pride) makes tokens that are copies of itself. This includes the mana symbols in its mana cost. Every token that is produced will provide [Primalcrux](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) with a +3/+3 boost. The best part is that all of those tokens must be blocked by exactly one creature, meaning that, barring a [Wall of Glare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Glare) or similar creature, your opponent will have to let your [Primalcrux](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) through unblocked. Smashy-smashy!

**[Regal Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regal+Force) + [Ambush Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambush+Commander)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Regal Force | Ambush Commander |

I'm not alone in thinking that paying green mana to draw cards is just about the best thing in **Magic**. Well, why limit yourself to drawing cards equal to the number of green creatures you control, when you can do that *and* draw a card for each [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) you control? Once [Ambush Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambush+Commander) is in play, all of your [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s become 1/1 green Elf creatures. Follow it up with lands six and seven and a [Regal Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regal+Force), and you'll draw at least eight cards. What to do with those cards I'll leave as an exercise for the reader. That's right, you've got homework.

**[Spirit of the Hearth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+of+the+Hearth) + [Scandalmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scandalmonger)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Spirit of the Hearth | Scandalmonger |

[Reminisce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reminisce)nt of the old [True Believer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True+Believer) + [Scandalmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scandalmonger), this one is a little less fragile and likewise relies on the fact that, although you control [Scandalmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scandalmonger), your opponent controls its ability every time he or she activates it. This leaves you free and clear to empty your opponent's hand while he or she must simply sit there and take it.

**[Archon of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice) + [Archon of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice) + [Hell's Caretaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Caretaker)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Archon of Justice | Hell's Caretaker |

Okay, these were all supposed to be dynamic duos, but I couldn't resist including some, uh, thermodynamic threesomes like the above. I mean, don't you just hate it when your opponent has permanents? I know I do. Given enough time, you can shrink your opponent's board to nothing by using [Hell's Caretaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Caretaker) to swap an [Archon of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice) in play for one in your graveyard. It doesn't sound very "just" to me, but there you go.

**[Antler Skulkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Antler+Skulkin) + [Necrotic Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrotic+Sliver) + [Juniper Order Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juniper+Order+Ranger)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Antler Skulkin | Juniper Order Ranger |

It was only a matter of time before we hit some persist shenanigans. Use [Antler Skulkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Antler+Skulkin) to give [Necrotic Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrotic+Sliver) persist, then sacrifice the Sliver to destroy one of your opponent's permanents. [Necrotic Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrotic+Sliver) will return to play with a -1/-1 counter which will promptly be negated by a +1/+1 courtesy of [Juniper Order Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juniper+Order+Ranger). Basically, you end up with repeatable [Vindicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate)s at five mana a pop. Reader Gareth A. sent this one in a slightly altered form. He replaced [Necrotic Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrotic+Sliver) with [Archon of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice) and a sacrifice outlet. Your [Vindicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate)s are cheaper that way, but you need another card.

**[Antler Skulkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Antler+Skulkin) + [Radiant's Dragoons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant%27s+Dragoons) + [Cenn's Tactician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cenn%27s+Tactician)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Radiant's Dragoons | Cenn's Tactician |

This is a great one for those who like cumbersome life-gaining combos that don't go infinite. I'm looking at you, Greg.

**[Antler Skulkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Antler+Skulkin) + [Meadowboon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meadowboon) + [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Meadowboon | Nantuko Husk |

A little trickier to pull off, in that you have to stack two triggered abilities in a certain order, this one allows you to put +1/+1 on each creature you control for each two mana you spend. How? First, give [Meadowboon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meadowboon) persist, then sacrifice it the Husk. Two things happen. [Meadowboon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meadowboon)'s leaves-play ability triggers, as does its persist ability. Put the leaves-play trigger on the bottom of the stack so the persist ability resolves first. [Meadowboon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meadowboon) will then return to play with a -1/-1 counter. Then its leaves-play ability will resolve, putting a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control. The -1/-1 counter will be canceled out. End result: temporary +2/+2 for some, +1/+1 counters for everybody else. Give [Meadowboon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meadowboon) persist once more, and you can run through this whole cycle again.

**[Necroskitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necroskitter) + Vhati *il*-Dal + [Thornbite Staff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornbite+Staff)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Necroskitter | Vhati il-Dal |

Hmm. These were all supposed to be dynamic duos (with a few bonus trios), but I really wanted to talk about some cool two-creature combos that involved an inanimate third party. Let's call it a "marital aid." This is one such combo.

One cool thing about wither is that it transforms any damage a creature deals into -1/-1 counters, not just combat damage. So, for example, a [Necroskitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necroskitter) wielding a [Thornbite Staff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornbite+Staff) can first shrink, then steal, just about any creature your opponent controls. You can steal a one-toughness creature for each two mana you spend (ping it, it dies, [Necroskitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necroskitter) untaps, you gain control of it). This can be fun if you also happen to control, say, [Godhead of Awe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godhead+of+Awe). A solution that is slower, but easier on the mana, involves the oft-forgotten [Vhati il-Dal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vhati+il-Dal). Use Vhati's ability to make an enemy creature into an X/1, blast it with your Staff-wielding [Necroskitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necroskitter), and watch as it then defects to your side. You can only do this once per turn, but if you add a second [Thornbite Staff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornbite+Staff) (one for Vhati), you can steal every creature on the board for the low, low price of two mana per creature!

**[Scarecrone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarecrone) + [Composite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Composite+Golem) + [Thornbite Staff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornbite+Staff)**



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Scarecrone | Thornbite Staff |

What can I say? [Thornbite Staff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornbite+Staff) is pretty combo-licious. This one also came from Skander R. and allows you to create an arbitrarily large amount of mana. Equip the Staff to [Scarecrone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarecrone). Sacrifice [Composite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Composite+Golem) for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif), untapping [Scarecrone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarecrone) in the process. Return [Composite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Composite+Golem) to play for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif) using [Scarecrone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarecrone)'s second activated ability, leaving you one mana of the colour of your choice. Repeat this process any number of times, gaining a mana with each iteration. Win condition? Well, if you have another Scarecrow in play, in your hand, or in your graveyard, you can use your infinite mana and [Scarecrone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarecrone)'s first activated ability to draw your entire deck. With an equipped [Thornbite Staff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornbite+Staff), each time you sacrifice a Scarecrow to draw a card will untap your [Scarecrone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarecrone). Return the Scarecrow to play, and run through the process again and again until you draw [Bottle Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+Gnomes) (to gain infinite life), [Reaper King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+King) (to destroy all of your opponent's permanents), or [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus) (to, um, win).

Noel shared a similar combo that used non-Standard cards ([Scarecrone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarecrone), [Su-Chi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Su-Chi), and [Intruder Alarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intruder+Alarm)) for "infinite life and death," but that combo would need a fourth card to kill the opponent (say, [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault)), gain infinite life ([Leonin Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Elder), among others), or generate infinite mana ([Phyrexian Altar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Altar), [Heartstone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartstone), etc.). Here's a sample decklist which can surely be improved:
