*Double Masters 2022* on MTGO
-----------------------------


Our newest set, *Double Masters 2022* is now live in the game. Sealed, Draft, and Phantom Draft Leagues are available. Check out the release article tomorrow to learn all about events, avatars (both for *Streets of New Capenna* and *Double Masters 2022*), and how Cryptic Spires will work in the game. Also be sure to check out [the updated Treasure Chest info page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info).

*Double Masters 2022* Limited Preliminaries – Now with QP Entry Option
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Limited Preliminary events now feature *Double Masters 2022*. For the first time, players will be able to enter these events with Qualifier Points!


This is the Limited offering we mentioned back in April for players to use their excess QPs *(especially all of those earned during the 20th Anniversary Series)* due to our Premier Play gap in May.


Like other *Masters* offerings, the entry options are 45 Event Tickets and 450 Play Points. The third option is 45 MOCS Season 2 QPs.


Prizes are the same as regular-set Preliminaries—this is due to the ability to reinvest QPs into extra Preliminaries in addition to the normal Qualifier, Super Qualifier, and Showcase Challenge options.




---

Qualifiers and Super Qualifiers in July
---------------------------------------


The qualifying season for the first tabletop Regional Championships is now underway. On *Magic Online*, that means the return of Qualifier and Super Qualifier events!


These tournaments offer the same great digital prizes, as well as Leaderboard Points for those vying for At-Large seats to the Season 2 Champions Showcase. We have expanded the number of invitations awarded from these events—two from Qualifiers and four from Super Qualifiers. If you win an invite, you'll get entry to the Regional Championship in the fall served by your home country.


The schedule for this weekend's Qualifiers/Super Qualifiers is shown below. It's another tripleheader weekend!




|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Date** | **Time (PT)** | **Time (UTC)** | **Event** | **Format** | **Invitation** |
| Friday, July 8, 2022 | 2:00 p.m. | 21:00 | Limited Qualifier | SNC Limited | Regional Championship (Tabletop) |
| Saturday, July 9, 2022 | 1:00 a.m. | 08:00 | Limited Qualifier | SNC Limited | Regional Championship (Tabletop) |

Addressing Pauper Card Availability
-----------------------------------


We are aware that the rollout of *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* in Treasure Chests is causing supply issues for key Pauper commons. We upped their presence in Treasure Chests, but that hasn't been enough, so we are working on an alternate solution to address the supply issue as soon as we can. Keep an eye on [*Magic Online* Twitter](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline) and this blog for updates.

Changes to Vintage and Standard Leagues
---------------------------------------


As part of our continuing efforts to combat anticompetitive behavior in our Leagues with smaller populations, adjustments were made to the Vintage and Standard Leagues during downtime last week.


The prize payout has been flattened to decrease the value incentive for poor behavior:


* 5 wins – 140 Play Points, 5 Qualifier Points, and 5 Treasure Chests
* 4 wins – 120 PPs, 2 QPs, and 4 TC
* 3 wins – 100 PPs, 1 QP, and 1 TC
* 2 wins – 50 PPs and 1 TC

*Magic Online* Format Challenges Every Weekend
----------------------------------------------


Format Challenges are the first step toward qualifying for Premier Play through your favorite *Magic* formats and provide excellent prizes for those looking to test their mettle in their favorite formats.

*NOTES:*
