### 
 Honorable Mention - [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst)



 We couldn't leave out the cutest of cards to make an impact this weekend, as five players in the field of twenty-four sleeved up a full play-set of [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst). Whether it was in Yuuya Watanabe's Jeskai Tokens deck, Raphaël Lévy's Mono-Red Aggro deck, or Nam Sung Wook's Mardu Tokens list, [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) was out there. It was, to a certain extent, held in check by all of the [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant)s stomping around the battlefield, but Outburst has proven itself a key cog in many a machine, and for that it deserves at least a nod in its direction.
