*What's the weirdest place you've ever played **Magic**?*

**PT窶適yoto Event Coverage Staff:** Midair! On the way to and from [Pro Tour窶適yoto](/en/events/coverage/nassif-greater-power), our flights were packed with coverage staff and players. There was plenty of Winston drafting, and at least one group each way managed to snag a whole row for a six- or eight-person *Shards* / *Shards* / *Conflux* booster draft.

The flight attendants grew curious about this game that so many people were playing on their plane, so we walked them through the basic idea of the game, told them about the Pro Tour, and left them with a stack of extra commons to look through.
