### Magic Humor

Back in the day," as they say, there was MiseTings.com, a purveyor of **Magic**-related humor. Not many people know this, but the *Unhinged* card [Mise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mise) was nearly previewed on that site, which would have caused great confusion.

MiseTings has sadly fallen into disrepair, but there are two active "Fake **Magic** News" sites providing the community with big laffs. They are:

### [The Magic Lampoon](http://www.magiclampoon.com/)

To be honest, we don't know what to make of articles like [Malfegor Announces He Loves These Little Debbies Snack Cakes](http://magiclampoon.com/blog/2010/01/26/malfegor-announces-he-loves-these-little-debbies-snack-cakes/), but there's an appealing level of weirdness there.

### [Good Gamery](http://www.goodgamery.com/)

Good Gamery combines Photoshopped cards and wacky news articles. The highlight of the year so far has been [Jace Week](http://goodgamery.com/index.php/2009/12/19/announcing-jace-week/), which was a solid seven days of Jace Beleren-based comedy.

*Have you seen an interesting **Magic** discussion somewhere? Let us know at @[dailymtg](http://www.twitter.com/dailymtg) or post in our own forums (the "Discuss on the message boards" link below will help) and maybe we'll feature it on **Community Spotlight**!*
