This year at PAX Prime, we sold ten exclusive guild t-shirts in our booth thanks to our new licensing partner, Araca. As word of these shirts spread onto the Internet, we received many requests for us to make these shirts available for purchase by everyone who couldn't make it to the convention.


Yesterday, we launched a two-week-long pre-sale with all ten guild shirts and a Planeswalker shirt!


Also, to celebrate the launch, we held a promotion [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic) asking you all to tweet the hashtag for your favorite guild. The guild that tweeted the most during a two-hour window would receive a 10% discount for the duration of the pre-sale!

All Izzet shirts are just $22.50 rather than the normal $25.00 being charged for all other guild shirts until the end of this presale.


Check out all the awesome shirts!
