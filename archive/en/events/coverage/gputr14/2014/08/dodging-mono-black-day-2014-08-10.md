A deck we didn't exactly expect to put up huge numbers this weekend was Naya Hexproof (sometimes also referred to as Naya Auras). Bram Bexkens and Paul Wiederspan are the two players that felt like beating the odds, running a deck that has a somewhat less favorable match-up against the Mono-Black Devotion Decks.


I got hold of Bram Bexkens just moments after he lost his match in round 13 against Andreas Reling. Despite the loss, he was in a pretty cheerful mood. I also caught up with Paul Wiederspan after the conclusion of the last round and I was able to ask both players a few questions about their deck choice for the weekend.




*Bram Bexkens ended up with a great result at his very first Grand Prix!*
