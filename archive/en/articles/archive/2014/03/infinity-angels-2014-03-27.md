This deck has been thrown around a little bit as of late, but this is the first time I've seen it finish well in a **Magic Online** Daily Event! Nukesaku scored a respectable 3–1 record with it. With two mana creatures; [Felhide Spiritbinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felhide+Spiritbinder); and [Aurelia, the Warleader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurelia%2C+the+Warleader), you can attack as many times as you'd like thanks to the new legend rule.



![Aurelia, the Warleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Aurelia,%20the%20Warleader&options=)

If your opponent stops your attempts at comboing, you're still working with a perfectly serviceable Naya Midrange deck. [Boros Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) and Planeswalkers give you plenty of game against [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), while cards like [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) and [Loxodon Smiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter) hold the fort against aggressive decks. Additionally, Naya has some of the best sideboard cards in the format, like Ruric Thar, [Mistcutter Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistcutter+Hydra), and [Mizzium Mortars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars).


While you probably won't combo too often, it's pretty nice to have access to, and none of the combo pieces are dead on their own. If anything, this deck highlights exactly how good [Felhide Spiritbinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felhide+Spiritbinder) can be without any special help.
