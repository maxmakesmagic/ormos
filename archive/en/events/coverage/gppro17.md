Day 2 Coverage



More than 550 teams and 1600 players made their way to the Rhode Island Convention Center in Providence this weekend, eager for an early look at the *Ixalan* Limited format and a shot at claiming the Grand Prix title.


On Day 2, 127 teams returned to build three new decks from fresh boosters and play another four rounds on their way to the Top 4. From a field full of pro players and team event all-stars, a final four emerged.


In the semifinals, Turtenwald, Jensen, and Duke quickly dispatched Li, Yao, and Ling. A few feet away, Andrew Baeckstrom, Martin Jůza, and Corey Burkhart did the same, taking down Grand Prix first-timers Will Sullivan, John Twardowski, and Cody DelPazzo.


That set up a near-exact rematch of the finals of Grand Prix Cleveland a few months ago, where Turtenwald, Jensen, and Duke beat Burkhart and Jůza, along with third Shuhei Nakamura, for the title. But this time, Baeckstrom, Jůza, and Burkhart got their revenge, with Baeckstrom and Jůza claiming decisive 2-0 victories.


Congratulation to Grand Prix Providence 2017 Champions, Andrew Baeckstrom, Martin Jůza, and Corey Burkhart!
