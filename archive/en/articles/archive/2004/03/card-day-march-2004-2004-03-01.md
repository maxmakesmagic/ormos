**Card of the Day - mercredi 31 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hoverguard%20Observer)#### Hoverguard Observer


 *Darksteel* uncommon.  
 Although it's almost an exact reprint of *Nemesis's* Stronghold Zeppelin, Hoverguard Observer's creature type was made Drone (instead of Ship) to line up with the flavor of the *Mirrodin* block.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 30 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dismantling%20Blow)#### Dismantling Blow


 *Invasion* common.  
 There was some discussion during *Invasion*  development to simply make Dismantling Blow a cantrip Disenchant. But since cantrips are found in many blocks and kicker is found only (so far) in *Invasion* block, it was created with the more unique kicker effect.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 29 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lord%20of%20Tresserhorn)#### Lord of Tresserhorn


 *Alliances* rare.  
 Lord of Tresserhorn has the legend with the highest power -- however, the 8/8 Zhou Yu, Chief Commander from *Portal Three Kingdoms* is the legend with the highest sum of power of toughness.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 26 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Swat)#### Swat


 *Urza's Legacy* and *Onslaught* common.  
 During *Urza's Legacy* development, there was concern that Swat was able to target black creatures, when many black removal spells can't. After some debate it was decided that it made Swat interesting enough to leave it that way.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 25 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wild%20Dogs)#### Wild Dogs


 *Urza's Saga* common.  
 As designed, Wild Dogs was a 2/1 for ![Green Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif) with the life-total drawback. Cycling was added to it later, during development.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 24 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Decree%20of%20Pain)#### Decree of Pain


 *Scourge*  rare.  
 Part of the cycle of "supercyclers" (the Decrees that generate a huge effect when either cast or cycled), Decree of Pain had its cycling cost reduced from ![5 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_5_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif) to ![3 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_3_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif) to make it competitive in constructed play.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 23 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Break%20Asunder)#### Break Asunder


 *Scourge*  common.  
 As designed, this card (and a few other non-creature spells in *Scourge*) had landcycling. During development, it was decided that landcycling should only appear on large creatures and Break Asunder's ability changed to regular cycling. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 22 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shimmering%20Barrier)#### Shimmering Barrier

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fangren%20Firstborn)#### Fangren Firstborn


 *Darksteel* rare.  
 This aggressive green attacker is the only card in **Magic** with a mana cost of ![1 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif).

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hallow)#### Hallow


 *Darksteel* common.  
 The flavor of this Awe Strikelike instant: it's a protective spell used by Leonin cleric elders to turn fire or death magic into healing light. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 17 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bonesplitter)#### Bonesplitter


 *Mirrodin* common.  
 For a while in development, this *Mirrodin* block staple granted first strike as well as +2/+0... but it cost ![3 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_3_mana.gif) mana to play and ![2 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_2_mana.gif) to equip. After the first strike was dropped it was changed to its current form. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 16 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dwell%20on%20the%20Past)#### Dwell on the Past


 *Torment* uncommon.  
 This card was going to cost ![2 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_2_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif) and be a cantrip, but it was changed to its current form to distance it from Gaea's Blessing.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 15 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pyramids)#### Pyramids


 *Arabian Nights* rare.  
 Sometimes good templating can increase the number of a card's abilities. As printed, Pyramids has one ability with an "or" clause. Its Oracle text is split into two abilities for clarity.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 12 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sliver%20Overlord)#### Sliver Overlord


 *Scourge* rare.  
 For a short time during development, Sliver Overlord had the ability "Sacrifice Sliver Overlord: Sliver legends get +13/+13 until end of turn." The idea was that it could combine with Sliver Queen to produce a huge 20/20 Sliver, but the combo was ruled too narrow and obscure, and was discarded.

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hunter%20Sliver)#### Hunter Sliver


 *Legions* common.  
 Hunter Sliver is the only two-headed sliver! At one time its ability granted the "Goblin War Drums" ability (Slivers can't be blocked except by two or more creatures) but that was replaced with *Legions'* provoke mechanic. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 10 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Brood%20Sliver)#### Brood Sliver


 *Legions* rare.  
 By creating sliver tokens that themselves have the Brood Sliver's ability, Brood Sliver has the potential to create an exponentially increasing number of slivers.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 9 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Metallic%20Sliver)#### Metallic Sliver

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mistform%20Sliver)#### Mistform Sliver

Mistform Sliver was concepted as a sliver that was made from the same material as the Mistform creatures, and is the only non-legendary sliver that has a creature type besides Sliver. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 5 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Soulscour)#### Soulscour


 *Darksteel* rare.  
 Soulscour is tied for the title of "sorcery with the highest converted mana cost," joining Decree of Annihilation and Time Stretch in that honor.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 4 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Well%20of%20Lost%20Dreams)#### Well of Lost Dreams


 *Darksteel* rare.  
 As designed, this card was symmetrical (meaning both players could benefit from its effect). It was changed to only work for the controller during development.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 3 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Myr%20Moonvessel)#### Myr Moonvessel


 *Darksteel* common.

**Card of the Day - mardi 2 mars 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Thunderstaff)#### Thunderstaff


 *Darksteel* uncommon.  
 This card originally had flavor text, but it had to be cut to make room for the mechanic. The flavor text was:  
 *“War is a constant. Only the rate of bloodshed changes.”  
 —Korva, Vulshok battlemaster*



**Card of the Day - lundi 1 mars 2004**
