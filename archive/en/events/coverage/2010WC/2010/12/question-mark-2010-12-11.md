Mark Rosewater has been running his Question Mark trivia game show at *Magic* World Championships for at least 75 years (EDITOR: please fact-check this). This year, it was a cross between a trivia game show and a panel discussion, as each person who answered a question correctly got to ask Mark a question in return. And we have Mark's questions right here! You won't get to ask Mark your question, but you'll get to feel clever for knowing so much about *Magic*.
