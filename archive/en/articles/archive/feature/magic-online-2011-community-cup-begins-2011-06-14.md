The teams have been chosen and players are prepping vigorously for the [Community Cup](/en/articles/archive/2011-magic-online-community-cup-details-2011-05-19) that begins this Wednesday! While the [Community Team](/en/articles/archive/2011-community-cup-community-team-2011-05-24) is confident, basking in the glory of two consecutive Community Cup wins, the [Wizards Team](/en/articles/archive/2011-community-cup-wizards-team-2011-05-31) has gone old school: drafting while doing wind sprints on the beach, tweaking Unified Modern sideboards while pulling sleighs in the Russian steppes, and play-testing Standard decks in streets of Philadelphia. Queue inspirational theme music and training montage now. 

Make sure you log to **Magic Online** anytime on June 15, June 16, or June 17 so you can receive your promotional [Darksteel Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Relic) when the Community Team loses (or invitation to a no-entry-requirement Planeswalker format tournament on July 3, should they win). 

Matches for the Community Cup will take place in the Anything Goes room in **Magic Online**. Players are welcome to come and hang out during the events to root for your team (but please don't send players personal messages or trade requests). See the schedule below for exact times:

* *Scars of Mirrodin* Block Draft: Wednesday, June 15 at 2:00 PM PDT
* Unified Modern Constructed: Thursday, June 16 at 2:00 PM PDT
* Unified Standard Constructed: Friday, June 17 at 9:00 AM PDT

In addition, if you live in the Seattle area, we will be heading to [Card Kingdom](http://www.cardkingdom.com/static/storeinfo/info) in Ballard to play Commander on Thursday, June 16. While we expect the Community Team will start playing around 8:00 PM, feel free to stop by earlier and grab a bite at Café Mox or start gaming early! Don't forget to bring your Commander deck, Archenemy schemes, Planechase planes, and your friends! 

Root for your team…. Go Wizards!
