Grand Prix Washington, D.C. is the largest Team Sealed by a mile. With 3,366 competitors there are over 1,100 teams who’ve been planeswalking through these giant halls. It’s hard to encapsulate everything in just a bunch of text and videos.


Here are some photos from around the horn (with even more in the “[Who Are You Wearing?](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpdc16/quick-questions-2-who-are-you-wearing-2016-03-12)” article earlier).


**Building**


During building we got some things from Chapman Sim, Huang Hao-Shan and Yam Wing Chun:

Or how about this team profile outtake from Gaudenis Vidugiris, Zvi Mowshowitz, Stephen Neal?

We’ve got camera hog Tristan Killeen fake-wearing a t-shirt and making me re-take a series of photos during a match while up-and-coming Nathan Steuer can’t contain his laughter in this series:

Speaking of playing, what about old-schoolers Lan D. Ho, Mark Herberholz, and Dan Burdick rocking it at teams as usual?

There are some other playing photos, but none better than young Jason Roger (whose family is part of Corbin Hosler’s [All in the Family](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpdc16/all-in-the-family-2016-03-12) piece) getting particularly upset.

And you know what? I don’t care that these next photos have already been used. I’m going finish this piece with a triptych of the three most memorable things I’ve seen from the day. A crazy lifepad, a foiled-out expedition card box, and a T-Rex running for president. How could I not?

There’s always so much *Magic* to be had at any given tournament. At the largest ever Team Sealed event, that’s true ten-fold.
