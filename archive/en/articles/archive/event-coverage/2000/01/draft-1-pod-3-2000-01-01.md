Martin had the unfortunate task of starting this draft:


### Set 1


**Booster 1**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPVIE01/921.jpg)*Pod 3*Martin: Dirty Wererat  

Bram: Pulsating Illusion  

Julian: Nantuku Disciple  

Dehlinger: Aven Cloudchaser  

Frederico: Halberdier  

Jakub: Morgue Theft  

Lippert: Rites of Spring  

Eivind: Embolden  

Eivind 2: Words of Wisdom


As might be expected, each of these players then went on to play their respective first pick colours. The interesting decisions in this booster were in the early picks: Despite green tending to be the preferred colour in Sealed Deck, the players at this table were painfully aware that it could easily get over-drafted. As a result Martin chose to go black in first position as it is hard to force an over-drafted colour from there. Then Bram also chose to take the blue card over the Nantuku Disciple. This was understandable as a lot of the top Pro Tour players have taken a heavy preference to playing blue cards in this draft format.


**Booster 2**


Bram: Treetop Sentinel  

Julian: Acceptable Losses?!?  

Dehlinger: Shelter
Frederico: Barbarian Lunatic  

Jakub: Dirty Werecat  

Lippert: Krosan Avenger  

Eivind: Words of Wisdom  

Martin: Crypt Creeper


I guess my only query from this booster was the Acceptable Losses. Either Julian knows something I don't, or that was a misguided pick that should probably have been either the Barbarian Lunatic (better red card) or Shelter.


**Booster 3**


Julian: Beast Attack  

Frederico: Thermal Blast  

Jakub: Patriach's Desire  

Lippert: Blazing Salvo  

Eivind: Angelic Wall  

Martin: Zombie Assasin  

Bram: Auromancer


Martin also managed to pick up a tenth pick Diabolic Tutor.


**Booster 4**


Dehli: Thought Devourer  

Frederico: Rabid Elephant  

Jakub: Repel  

Lippert: Gorilla Titan  

Eivind: Mystic Zealot  

Martin: Krosan Avenger  

Bram: Syncopate  

Julian: Leaf Dancer


**Booster 5**


Frederico: Iridescent Angel  

Jakub: Ghastly Demise  

Lippert: Werebear  

Eivind: Aven Flock  

Martin: Crypt Creeper  

Bram: Aven Cloudchaser  

Julian: Skyshooter


I was not sure if there was just no card strong enough for Dato to not hate the Angel at this stage. Maybe he thought he might move into one of blue or white and then splash a third colour for the Angel, but I think I would have taken the Werebear here.


**Booster 6**


Jakub: Aven Windreader  

Lippert: Liquid Fire  

Eivind: Master Apothecary  

Martin: Afflict  

Bram: Hallowed Healer


**Booster 7**


Lippert: Shower of Coals  

Eivind: Aether Burst  

Martin: Morbid Hunger  

Bram: Patrol Hound  

Julian: Leaf Dancer  

Dehli: Embolden


Amazingly Julian managed to wheel a twelfth pick Lithatog when there was very little else in the booster at all.


**Booster 8**


Eivind: Beloved Chaplin:  

Martin: Elephant Ambush  

Bram: Second Thought  

Julian: Krosan Archerr  

Dehli: Pilgrim of Justice  

Frederico: Leaf Dancer  

Jakub: Childhood Horror  

Lippert: Seton's Desire  

Lippert 2: Psionic Gift (hate draft).


So, after one round of boosters these were the colours the players adopted:

As expected there were alternate green players at this draft table. It came as no surprise that there were alternate blue players here too. Julian was well positioned for red cards on this table, as was Eivind for white, but the only colour only drafted by two players on the table was black, which Jakub was very well seated for.


### Set 2 (Anti-clockwise)


**Booster 1**


Eivind: Cephalid Broker  

Lippert: Squirrel Nest  

Jakub: Cephalid Looter  

Frederico: Thermal Blast  

Dehli: Afflict  

Julian: Krosan Avenger  

Bram: Dematerialise  

Martin: Nantuku Disciple


**Booster 2**


Lippert: Dwarven Strike Force  

Jakub: Repel  

Frederico: Barbarian Lunatic  

Dehli: Kirtar's Wrath  

Julian: Diligent Farmhand  

Bram: Words of Wisdom  

Martin: Krosan Archer


**Booster 3**


Jakub: Ghastly Demise  

Frederico: Barbarian Lunatic  

Dehli: Resilient Warrior  

Julian: Repel  

Bram: Aven Cloudchaser  

Martin: Skeletal Scrying


**Booster 4**


Frederico: Springing Tiger  

Dehli: Aven Flock  

Julian: Epicenter  

Bram: Angelic Wall  

Martin: Twigwalker  

Eivind: Aven Fisher


**Booster 5**


Dehli: Second Thoughts  

Julian: Moment's Peace  

Bram: Luminous Guardian  

Martin: Whispering Shade  

Eivind: Chamber of Manipulation  

Lippert: Diligent Farmhand


**Booster 6**


Julian: Fierbolt  

Bram: Aven Flock  

Martin: Nantuku Disciple  

Eivind: Syncopate  

Lippert: Barbarian Ring


**Booster 7**


Bram: Nomad Decoy  

Martin: Ghastly Demise  

Eivind: Bomb Squad  

Lippert: Muscle Burst  

Jakub: Face of Fear
Frederico: Pilgrim of Justice  

Dehli: Cephalid Scout  

Julian: Halberdier


**Booster 8**


Martin: Wild Mongrel  

Eivind: Aven Windreader  

Lippert: Metamorphic Wurm  

Jakub: Aether Burst  

Frederico: Limestone Golem  

Dehli: Hallowed Healer  

Julian: Cartographer


This booster was stunning, as nobody chose to hate draft a Morbid Hunger, that made it back round to Jakub Slemr as a thirteenth pick! That card was a bit of a life saver for the former World Champion, as his deck, despite being only one of the two black decks on the table, was looking very thin at this stage. Notice how few good picks he had in the second set of boosters.


### Set 3


The third set passed with very few broken cards emerging, other than Christoph Lippert receiving a Kamahl, Pit Fighter.


The first booster was intriguing though, as Martin Scheuchenstuhl chose to take a Rabid Elephant over a Painbringer, which managed to find its way to Jakub.


The only other noticeable incident was when Lippert hate drafted a Syncopate from Nitter, the European Champion had to make a panic pick and missed a Sphere of Reason, which was a very powerful card on the four blue player table.
