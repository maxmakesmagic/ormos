**Position**


1. Gunnar Refsdal
2. Tom Van der Logt
3. Peter Gysemans
4. Gottlieb Yeh
5. Noah Boeken
6. Franck Canu
7. Niels Sanders Jensen
8. Daniel O'Mahoney Schwartz

During this draft I followed Dan and Niels.


**The first boosters:**


 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Booster 1:** |  |
| Gunnar | Stinging Barrier |
| Tom | Snorting Ghar |
| Peter | Ramosian Captain |
| Gottlieb | Tidal Kraken |
| Noah | Cho-Mano's Blessing |
| Franck | Lightning Hounds |
| Niels | Horned Troll |
| Dan | Pious Warrior |
| Dan2 | Alley Grifters |
| Niels2 | Thwart |

The rest was dribble. Niels' Horned Troll pick was an understandable choice as the only other green card was the other side of the table. Dan skipped the thwart because he had a first pick Barrier to his right, and both the Grifter and Warrior are playable. Thwart was looking much better in Niels' position.


The second booster saw a bunch of green spells, which is bad for Niels, who takes a Deepwood Drummer nevertheless. Dan takes a Hired Giant and a Battle Rampart.


In the third booster Canu decides to push green, so Niels takes a Wild Jhovall, stiffing Dan, who ends up with a Task Force.


In the fourth Canu again forces the green, so Niels again takes a Kris Mage, so Dan takes a Devout Witness. Dan does not have a great set of cards at this point.


Niels, seemingly leaving green behind, takes a Drake Hatchling next, and DOMS swipes a Lieutenant.


The sixth booster decides Dan's second colour - he chooses Snuff Out over Bargaining and Story Circle ( Canu having just opened his 783921 Power card of the day in the form of Volcanic Winds!). Niels takes Drake no.2, but feels uncomfortable knowing that Franck pushed him out of green and is now going to push red too! At least he will have the Nemesis red.


The intimate relationship between Dan and Niels was exposed when the Dane took a first pick Drating Merfolk and passed a Monkey Cage to OMS in booster no.7. Wtf?


The last booster of the set saw Dan breaking open a Kyren Negotiations, and taking a Delraich. So, 1 set through and Dan looks like white/black, and Niels probably red/blue.


The table is starting to take form:


 




|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | Gottlieb: R/U |  |  |
|  | Peter: U/W |  | Noah: B/W |  |
| Tom: B/G |  |  |  | Franck: B/R/G? |
|  | Gunnar: G/U |  | Niels: U/R |  |
|  |  | Dan: W/B |  |  |

Note: Dan is the only drafter not blocked either side.


Nemesis picks
-------------




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Niels:** | Flowstone Crusher | **Dan:** | Battlefield Percher |
|  | Arc Mage |  | Spitefull Bully |
|  | Mogg Salvage |  | Belbe's Percher |
|  | Flowstone Crusher |  | Plague Witch |
|  | Flowstone Crusher |  | Seal of Fire (defensive) |
|  | Seal of Fire (above Titan?) |  | Belbe's Percher |
|  | Submerge |  | Lin Sivvi (3rd pick) |
|  | Flowstone Thopter |  | Lawbringer |

Prophecy picks
--------------




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Niels** | Alexi's Cloak | **Dan** | Mine Bearer |
|  | Stormwatch Eagle |  | Bog Glider & Despoil |
|  | Efreet!
 he thought it was a Fault Rider, so took it over Rethink! |  | Soul Charmer |
|  | Withdraw & Ridgeline Racer |  | Soul Strings |
|  | Fault Rider
 he thought he was rare drafting an Efreet |  | Noxious Field and Bog Glider |
|  | Barbed Field |  | Steal Strength |
|  | Lightbringer |  | Chimeric Idol |
|  | Minatour & 1/4 Spider |  | Mageta's Boon |

There were not many really broken cards here, just a solid set of *Prophecy*.


Did I forget to mention that Canu opened up an Avatar of Fury?
