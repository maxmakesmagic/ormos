Think you've been to a big Grand Prix?


Grand Prix Richmond is vast. This is the main hall before the players arrived:

Then, the flood arrived.

But if you could count everyone in the room with feature match tabls you'd come up nearly 1,600 players short. Why? Grand Prix Richmond is too large for the main hall, so one of the flights was set up across the street.


No, really. It's that vast.


First, you leave the main hall:

Then, head down the hallway until you ascend the escalator:

You're then greeted by another, longer hallway to traverse:

The sunny skywalk across the street is next:

A short hallway and it's the entrance to the third flight:

Here nearly 1,600 players, such as Ari Lax, Patrick Cox, Alex Majalton, and (8) Josh Utter-Leyton, duke it out for the right to return on Day 2:

And that's the Grand Prix across the street.
