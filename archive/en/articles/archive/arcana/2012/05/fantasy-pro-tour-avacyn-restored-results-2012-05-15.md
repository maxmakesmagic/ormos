That's a great ballot. The best one anyone came up with. But it's not the best one possible. For the theoretical maximum points, you'd want to swap out [Curse of Death's Hold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=227075) and [Witchbane Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witchbane+Orb) for [Triumph of Ferocity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triumph+of+Ferocity) (worth 100 points) and [Grafdigger's Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage) (worth 190 points). And you'd probably also want to pick Alexander Hayne as your pro player, given that he [won the Pro Tour](/en/events/coverage/angels-carry-hayne-miraculous-victory).
