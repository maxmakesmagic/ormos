Each week we will offer these drafts (no event tickets required) on different product in order to make it easier to try and earn qualifier points for the season championships, to coincide with our [Weekend Premier Events](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/091808a), or to offer opportunities to play with previously released product. The announced events will start after each week’s downtime and run until the next one begins.

If the set currently has draft queues available, we will replace those queues with Nix Tix versions. If not, we will create a Nix Tix 4-3-2-2 draft queue for the scheduled period. 

Here is the schedule of upcoming Weekly Nix Tix events for 2010:
