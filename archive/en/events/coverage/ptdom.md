Sunday Coverage



What started for Iowa resident Wyatt Darby in his a second Pro Tour thanks to Regional Pro Tour Qualifier success ended with $50,000, an invitation to the 2018 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship, and the title of Pro Tour *Dominaria* champion for the young competitor.


Darby locked up his Top 8 finish in Round 15 thanks to a timely Lightning Strike, as his Red Aggro deck earned him a spot in Sunday’s playoff rounds alongside three other Pro Tour first-time Top 8 competitors and four returning veterans, the latter of which did not make Darby’s path to the trophy easy as he began to advance through a bracket of nothing but red. His quarterfinal match against Revelation’s Thomas Hendriks—competing in his second Top 8—went to Darby 3-1, advancing him to a semifinal match against Pro Tour Hall of Fame competitor Owen Turtenwald of Ultimate Guard Pro Team. After dispatching the Hall of Famer, Darby went up against Portugal’s Gonçalo Pinto in a battle to see who would head home with the title and trophy.


After five fast games, it was a timely Glorybringer that turned the tide for Darby, clinching him the fifth game and the deciding match.


Pro Tour *Dominaria* showcased the story and power of Goblin Chainwhirler, the 40-card skill of 2017-18 Draft Master Elias Watsfeldt, the 60-card prowess of 2017-18 Constructed Master Matthew Severa, and the Pro Tour dominance of Wyatt Darby. Congratulations to all three players on their World Championship invitations, and for making Pro Tour *Dominaria* one to remember.
