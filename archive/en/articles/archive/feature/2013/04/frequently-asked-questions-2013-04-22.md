 An FAQ is a collection of clarifications and rulings involving the cards in a new **Magic**: The Gathering set. It's intended to make playing with these new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [www.wizards.com/customerservice](http://www.wizards.com/customerservice). 

This FAQ has two sections, each of which serves a different purpose.

The first section ("General Notes") explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.

The second section ("Card-Specific Notes") contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

### GENERAL NOTES

### New Mechanic: Split Cards with Fuse

 Split cards, featured prominently in the original *Ravnica* block, are back with a new twist: the *fuse* ability. 

All split cards have two card faces on a single card. You can choose which half of the card you want to cast, pay that half's mana cost, and only that half will go on the stack. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack.

 Fuse introduces a third option if you're casting a *Dragon's Maze* split card from your hand: cast the entire card as a single spell by paying both of its mana costs.

The official rules for fuse are as follows:


> 
> 702.100. Fuse
> 
> 
>  702.100a Fuse is a static ability found on some split cards (see rule 708, “Split Cards”) that applies while the card with fuse is in a player’s hand. If a player casts a split card with fuse from his or her hand, the player may choose to cast both halves of that split card. This choice is made before putting the split card with fuse onto the stack. The resulting spell is a *fused split spell*. 
> 
> 
> 702.100b A fused split spell has two sets of characteristics and one converted mana cost. The converted mana cost of the spell is a number equal to the total amount of mana in its two mana costs, regardless of color.
> 
> 
> 702.100c The total cost of a fused split spell includes the mana cost of each half. (See rule 601.2e.)
> 
> 
> 702.100d As a fused split spell resolves, the controller of the spell follows instructions of the left half and then follows the instructions of the right half.
> 
> 
> 


* If you're casting a split card with fuse from any zone other than your hand, you can't cast both halves. You'll only be able to cast one half or the other.
  
* To cast a fused split spell, pay both of its mana costs. For example, Down & Dirty has mana costs of {3}{B} and {2}{G}. To cast both halves, you pay {5}{B}{G}. While the spell is on the stack, its converted mana cost is 7.
  
* You can choose the same object as the target of each half of a fused split spell, if appropriate. For example, if both the left and right halves of a split card require a "target creature," you can choose the same creature for each instance of the word target (but you don't have to).
  
* When resolving a fused split spell with multiple targets, treat it as you would any spell with multiple targets. If all targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, the spell is countered and none of its effects happen. If at least one target is still legal at that time, the spell resolves, but an illegal target can't perform any actions or have any actions performed on it.
  
* When a fused split spell resolves, follow the instructions of the left half first, then the instructions on the right half.
  
* In every zone except the stack, split cards have two sets of characteristics and two converted mana costs. If anything needs information about a split card not on the stack, it will get two values. For example, if a player reveals Down & Dirty due to [Duskmantle Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskmantle+Seer)'s ability ("At the beginning of your upkeep, each player reveals the top card of his or her library, loses life equal to that card's converted mana cost, then puts it into his or her hand."), the game will see its converted mana cost as 4 and 3. This translates to that player losing a total of 7 life.
  
* On the stack, a split spell that hasn't been fused has only that half's characteristics and converted mana cost. The other half is treated as though it didn't exist.
  
* Some split cards with fuse have two monocolor halves of different colors. If such a card is cast as a fused split spell, the resulting spell is multicolored. If only one half is cast, the spell is the color of that half. While not on the stack, such a card is multicolored.
  
* Some split cards with fuse have two halves that are both multicolored. That card is multicolored no matter which half is cast, or if both halves are cast. It's also multicolored while not on the stack.
  
* If a player names a card, the player may name either half of a split card, but not both. A split card has the chosen name if one of its two names matches the chosen name. This is a recent rules change.
  
* If you cast a split card with fuse from your hand without paying its mana cost, you can choose to use its fuse ability and cast both halves without paying their mana costs.
  
  

**Cycle: Guildgates**


 The *Dragon's Maze*set includes a cycle of nonbasic lands with the subtype Gate. Each guild has a Gate card with Guildgate in its name that taps for mana of either of that guild's colors. These cards were previously printed in the *Return to Ravnica* and *Gatecrash* sets; they appear here with new art.

> 


* The subtype Gate has no special rules significance, but other spells and abilities may refer to it.
  
* Gate is not a basic land type.
  
  

**Cycle: Gatekeepers**


 The *Dragon's Maze* set includes a cycle of Gatekeepers with enters-the-battlefield abilities that give you a bonus for controlling two or more Gates. 


> 
> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/dgm/tiwoirwiixix/tjl46adywr_EN.jpg)Opal Lake Gatekeepers   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  
>  Creature — Vedalken Soldier   
>  2/4   
>  When Opal Lake Gatekeepers enters the battlefield, if you control two or more Gates, you may draw a card. 


* The Gatekeepers’s ability is only checking for lands with the Gate land type. It doesn’t matter whether those Gates have the same name or different names.
  
* The number of Gates you control is checked both when the ability would trigger and again when it tries to resolve. If you don’t control two or more Gates when the ability would resolve, it won’t do anything.
  
* The bonus applies only once as long as you control two or more Gates. For example, if you control four Gates when Opal Lake Gatekeepers enters the battlefield, you may draw one card, not two.
  
  

**Returning Themes: Guilds and Guildmarks**


 The original *Ravnica block* introduced the plane of Ravnica, a world dominated by cityscape and controlled by ten guilds, each centered around two colors. For the first time ever, all ten guilds appear in one set. If a card in the *Dragon's Maze* set is associated with a guild, it features the appropriate guildmark in the background of its text box. These guildmarks have no effect on game play. 

  

**Returning Mechanics: Guild Keywords, Keyword Actions, and Ability Words**


 All ten guild mechanics, originally introduced in the *Return to Ravnica* and *Gatecrash* sets, return in the *Dragon's Maze* set. For more information on those mechanics, please see the *Return to Ravnica* and *Gatecrash* FAQs at [Wizards.com/Magic/Rules](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs). 


*Return to Ravnica*: detain (Azorius), overload (Izzet), unleash (Rakdos), scavenge (Golgari), and populate (Selesnya)   
*Gatecrash*: extort (Orzhov), cipher (Dimir), bloodrush (Gruul), battalion (Boros), and evolve (Simic)

> 


* Ætherling’s first ability will return it to the battlefield only if that ability also exiled it. If Ætherling left the battlefield in response to that ability, it won’t return, even if it was exiled by another spell or ability.
  
  
* Ætherling’s last ability can be activated even if its power is 0 or less. If a creature would assign 0 or less damage in combat, it doesn’t assign combat damage at all.

* Dangerous doesn’t give any creatures the ability to block the target creature. It just forces those creatures that are already able to block the creature to do so.
  
* As blockers are declared, any creature that’s tapped or affected by a spell or ability that says it can’t block doesn’t block. If there’s a cost associated with having the creature block, no player is forced to pay that cost, so it doesn’t block if that cost isn’t paid.
  
* If there are multiple combat phases, creatures that blocked the creature targeted by Dangerous in the first combat aren’t required to block it again in subsequent combats.

* A monocolored creature is exactly one color. (Colorless creatures aren’t monocolored.)
  
* No monocolored creature will be able to block that turn, including monocolored creatures that enter the battlefield after Awe for the Guilds resolves. A creature that’s monocolored when Awe for the Guilds resolves but somehow becomes multicolored before blockers are declared will be able to block.

* Activating Beetleform Mage’s ability after it’s been blocked by a creature without flying or reach won’t cause it to become unblocked.

>  Creature — Minotaur Soldier   
>  5/3   
>  Whenever an instant or sorcery spell you control deals damage, put two 1/1 red and white Soldier creature tokens with haste onto the battlefield. 


* Blaze Commando’s ability triggers each time an instant or sorcery spell you control deals damage (or, put another way, the number of times the word “deals” appears in its instructions), no matter how much damage is dealt or how many players or permanents are dealt damage. For example, if you cast Punish the Enemy and it “deals 3 damage to target player and 3 damage to target creature,” Blaze Commando’s ability will trigger once and you’ll get two Soldier tokens.
  
* Some instant or sorcery spells cause other objects to deal damage, rather than deal damage themselves. Such spells don’t cause Blaze Commando to trigger.

* Any time you are instructed to draw more than one card, you draw them one at a time. For example, if you control Blood Scrivener and have no cards in hand and you’re instructed to “draw two cards,” your first card draw is replaced by drawing two cards and losing 1 life, then you’ll draw the second card from the original instruction. In total, you’ll draw three cards and lose 1 life.
  
* Each additional Blood Scrivener you control will effectively add one card and 1 life lost. Say you control two Blood Scriveners and would draw a card while you have no cards in hand. The effect of one Blood Scrivener will replace the event “draw a card” with “draw two cards and lose 1 life.” The effect of the other Blood Scrivener will replace the drawing of the first of those two cards with “draw two cards and lose 1 life.” You’ll draw two cards and lose 1 life, then draw another card and lose another 1 life.

* You may choose zero targets for either or both instances of “up to one target creature.”
  
* If you choose two targets for Boros Battleshaper’s ability, and only one of those targets is legal when the ability tries to resolve, only the legal target will be affected. If all targets are illegal when the ability tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen.
  
* The controller of each creature chooses which player or planeswalker it attacks or which attacking creature it blocks, as appropriate.
  
* A creature forced to attack does so only if it’s able to do so as attackers are declared. If, at that time, the creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can’t attack, or hasn’t been under that player’s control continuously since the turn began (and doesn’t have haste), then it doesn’t attack. If there’s a cost associated with having the creature attack, the creature’s controller isn’t forced to pay that cost, so it doesn’t attack in that case either.
  
* If another player gains control of the creature chosen to attack or block if able after it attacks, that creature isn’t forced to then block during that same combat.

* If you cast Catch & Release as a fused split spell, you can sacrifice the permanent you just gained control of.
  
* If you control an artifact creature, a nonartifact creature, and no other artifacts or creatures, you must sacrifice both permanents. You must choose the artifact creature as the artifact and the nonartifact creature as the creature. The same is true for any combination of types—you sacrifice a number of permanents as close to five as possible.

* If you name half of a split card with fuse, and then you cast both halves, the cost reduction will apply to the total cost of the spell. This is true even if the half with the chosen name requires only colored mana to cast.

* The card is chosen at random as the ability resolves. If any player responds to the ability, that player won’t yet know what card will be chosen.
  
* Because the last ability doesn’t target any card in your graveyard, any card put into your graveyard in response to the ability may be chosen.
  
* Each card in your graveyard must have an equal chance of being chosen. Assigning them each a number and rolling a die is an easy way to do this. In formats that allow you to rearrange your graveyard—including Standard, Modern, and *Return to Ravnica* block Limited formats, you may also shuffle your graveyard face down and choose a card at random

* If you cast Dragonshift using overload, only creatures you control when it resolves will be affected. Creatures that come under your control later in the turn will not.
  
* Each affected creature will lose all other colors and creature types and be only red, blue, and a Dragon. Each will retain any other types it may have had, such as artifact.
  
* Each affected creature will lose any abilities it may have gained prior to Dragonshift resolving. Notably, this includes the ability to cast the copies of a card with cipher that’s encoded on the creature, although that ability will return after the turn ends.
  
* If any of the affected creatures gains an ability after Dragonshift resolves, it will keep that ability.
  
* Dragonshift overwrites all previous effects that set a creature’s power or toughness to specific values. However, effects that set a creature’s power or toughness to specific values that start to apply after Dragonshift resolves will overwrite this effect.
  
* Effects that modify the power or toughness of an affected creature, such as the effects of Phytoburst or Legion’s Initiative, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature’s power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.

* As Flesh is resolving, if the creature is an illegal target but the creature card is still a legal target, the creature card will be exiled but no counters will be put onto the creature. If the creature is the only legal target, Flesh will still resolve but will have no effect as you didn’t exile a card.
  
* As Blood is resolving, if only one of the targets is legal, Blood will still resolve but will have no effect: If the first target is illegal, it can’t deal damage to anything. If the second target creature or player is illegal, it can’t be dealt damage.
  
* The number of +1/+1 counters is based on the power of the creature card as it last existed in the graveyard.
  
* The amount of damage dealt is based on the first target creature’s power as Blood resolves.
  
* If you cast Flesh & Blood as a fused split card, the +1/+1 counters will have been placed before the amount of damage is determined.

* Master of Cruelties isn’t forced to attack, but if it does, it must do so alone. If you control another creature with an ability that says it must attack if able, that creature must attack and Master of Cruelties won’t be able to.
  
* If Master of Cruelties attacks alone, another creature entering the battlefield attacking will have no effect on it. Master of Cruelties continues to be an attacking creature. The other attacking creature will assign combat damage normally, regardless of whether Master of Cruelties’s last ability triggers.
  
* Master of Cruelties’s last ability won’t trigger if it attacks a planeswalker.
  
* For a player’s life total to become 1, what actually happens is that the player loses (or in some rare cases, gains) the appropriate amount of life. For example, if the player’s life total is 4 when the last ability resolves, it will cause that player to lose 3 life. Other effects that interact with life loss (or gain) will interact with this effect accordingly.
  
* Assigning no combat damage isn’t the same as preventing that damage. Effects that make damage unpreventable will have no effect if no combat damage can be assigned.

* Returning Maze’s End to its owner’s hand is part of the cost to activate its last ability. Once that ability is announced, players can’t respond to it until after you’ve paid its activation cost and returned Maze’s End to hand.
  
* When the last ability of Maze’s End resolves, you’ll search for a Gate and put it onto the battlefield before checking to see if you win the game. This check will happen even if you don’t put a Gate onto the battlefield this way. This check will happen only as the ability resolves, not at other times.
  
* Putting a Gate onto the battlefield with Maze’s End doesn’t count as the one land you can play during your turn. If it’s your turn, you can play Maze’s End or a different land card from your hand after its ability has resolved.
  
* Controlling multiple Gates with the same name has no effect on your ability to win the game with Maze’s End. The excess Gates are simply ignored.

>  Play with the top card of your library revealed.   
>  You may cast the top card of your library if it’s an instant or sorcery card.   
>  Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your library, copy it. You may choose new targets for the copy. 


* Melek doesn’t affect the timing rules associated with when you can cast the card. If it’s a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
  
* You still pay all costs for that spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs, such as overload costs. Although you can’t pay additional costs for the copy that’s created, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
  
* While playing with the top card of your library revealed, if you draw multiple cards, reveal each one before you draw it.
  
* The top card of your library isn’t in your hand. You can’t discard it, for instance.
  
* Melek’s last ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell you cast from your library, not just one with targets.
  
* When the last ability resolves, it creates a copy of the spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it’s not “cast.” Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won’t trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
  
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it’s copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can’t choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
  
* If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says “Choose one —” or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can’t choose a different one.
  
* If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Debt to the Deathless has), the copy has the same value of X.
  
* The *Avacyn Restored* set featured instant and sorcery cards with miracle, an ability that allows a player to cast a card immediately upon drawing it. If you cast a spell this way, you're casting it from your hand, not your library. Melek's ability won't trigger.

* If you and an opponent each control a Notion Thief, the replacement effects generated by their abilities will essentially cancel each other out. If the opponent would draw a card other than the first of his or her draw step, that draw will be skipped and you’ll draw a card. The opponent’s Notion Thief will then cause that draw to be skipped and the opponent will draw a card instead. Neither replacement effect can apply to this event again, so your opponent draws a card.

* Artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal are card types. Two cards share a card type if they have at least one card type in common.
  
* The original spell is part of the group of exiled cards put on the bottom of the library in a random order. If the exiled card that shared a card type with that card wasn’t cast, it’s also part of this group.
  
* If Possibility Storm’s ability doesn’t exile the original spell (perhaps because another Possibility Storm already exiled it), you’ll still exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a card that shares a card type with it and have the opportunity to cast that spell.
  
* If you cast a spell without paying its mana cost, you can’t pay any alternative costs, such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
  
* If the spell you cast from exile has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.
  
* The *Avacyn Restored* set featured instant and sorcery cards with miracle, an ability that allows a player to cast a card immediately upon drawing it. If a player casts a spell this way, the spell is cast from that player’s hand. Possibility Storm will trigger.

>  You may have Progenitor Mimic enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield except it gains “At the beginning of your upkeep, if this creature isn’t a token, put a token onto the battlefield that’s a copy of this creature.” 


* Progenitor Mimic copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token). It doesn’t copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
  
* The original Progenitor Mimic will create tokens, but those token copies will not.
  
* If you choose to have Progenitor Mimic enter the battlefield as a copy of a creature, the triggered ability it gains will become part of its copiable values. For example, suppose Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a copy of Runeclaw Bear, a 2/2 green Bear creature with mana cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif). The resulting object is a 2/2 green Bear creature named Runeclaw Bear with mana cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) and with “At the beginning of your upkeep, if this creature isn’t a token, put a token onto the battlefield that’s a copy of this creature.” If another Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a copy of that creature, it will be a Runeclaw Bear with *two* instances of the triggered ability.
  
* If the chosen creature is a token, Progenitor Mimic copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. Copying a token doesn’t make Progenitor Mimic become a token.
  
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield. Any “as [this creature] enters the battlefield” or “[this creature] enters the battlefield with” abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
  
* If the chosen creature has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
  
* If Progenitor Mimic somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can’t become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that’s already on the battlefield.
  
* You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.

If you do, return Pyrewild Shaman to your hand. 


* Pyrewild Shaman’s last ability triggers only once for each time combat damage is dealt, no matter how many creatures are dealing damage at that time.
  
* Pyrewild Shaman’s ability can trigger during each combat damage step. For example, if a creature with first strike deals combat damage, you can return Pyrewild Shaman to your hand, and discard it using its bloodrush ability to pump up an attacking creature without first strike. Then, when that creature deals combat damage, you can return Pyrewild Shaman to your hand again.
  
* Pyrewild Shaman’s last ability triggers only if it’s in your graveyard when the creatures deal combat damage to a player. It returns only to your hand only if it’s still in your graveyard when the ability resolves. Notably, if Pyrewild Shaman is dealt lethal damage at the same time that a creature you control deals combat damage to a player, Pyrewild Shaman’s ability won’t trigger.
  
* If creatures you control deal combat damage to more than one player at the same time (perhaps because it’s a multiplayer game), Pyrewild Shaman’s ability will trigger once for each of those players. However, only the first such ability that you pay for will return Pyrewild Shaman to your hand. Even if it returns to your graveyard before the other abilities resolve, it’s considered a different Pyrewild Shaman than the one whose ability triggered.

* To choose a target at random, all legal targets must have an equal chance of being chosen. There are many ways to do this, including assigning each possible legal target a number and rolling a die.
  
* The target is chosen at random as part of putting the ability on the stack. Players can respond to the ability knowing what the target of the ability is.
  
* If Scab-Clan Giant leaves the battlefield before its ability resolves, no fight will happen and neither creature will deal damage. Also, if the target creature is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve, it will be countered and no fight will happen.
  
* In a multiplayer game, you don’t choose a single opponent at random. Any creature controlled by any of your opponents may be chosen at random.

> 


* Trait Doctoring changes the color word or basic land type each time it appears in the permanent’s type line and/or rules text. It doesn’t change the name of the card or any instances of the word being used as part of a card’s name.
  
* You choose what word you’re changing and what word you’re changing it to as Trait Doctoring resolves.
  
* You can target any permanent with Trait Doctoring, including one with no color words or basic land types on it.
  
* Trait Doctoring’s effect changes only the text printed on the permanent. It can’t change words found in abilities it’s been granted. For example, if you’ve changed “green” to “blue,” and the permanent gains protection from green (as opposed to having protection from green printed on it), tha t protection ability is unaffected. The permanent will have protection from green.
  
* If the basic land type of a land is changed, the associated mana ability of that land will also change, but its name will not. For example, if you’ve changed “Plains” to “Island,” a card named Plains will have the basic land type Island and can be tapped for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif), and it can no longer be tapped for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif).

* Turn will cause the creature to lose all other colors and creature types, but it will retain any other card types (such as artifact) it may have.
  
* Turn overwrites all previous effects that set the targeted creature’s power or toughness to specific values. Effects that set its power or toughness to specific values that start to apply after Turn resolves will overwrite this effect.
  
* Turn doesn’t counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated. In particular, there is no way to cast this to stop a creature’s “At the beginning of your upkeep” or “When this creature enters the battlefield” abilities from triggering.
  
* If the affected creature gains an ability after Turn resolves, it will keep that ability.
  
* Effects that modify the targeted creature’s power or toughness, such as the effects of Phytoburst or Legion’s Initiative, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature’s power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.

* While Varolz, the Scar-Striped is on the battlefield, the scavenge cost of a creature card in your graveyard is equal to its mana cost, including any colored mana requirements.
  
* Abilities that reduce the cost to cast a creature spell or alternative costs you can pay rather than a card’s mana cost don’t apply to activating a card’s scavenge ability.
  
* The number of counters that a card’s scavenge ability puts on a creature is based on the card’s power as it last existed in the graveyard.

>  Whenever you tap Zhur-Taa Druid for mana, it deals 1 damage to each opponent. 


* Zhur-Taa Druid’s last ability doesn’t trigger if it becomes tapped for any other reason. However, if Zhur-Taa Druid gains another mana ability that requires you tap it, its ability will trigger.
  
* If you tap Zhur-Taa Druid for mana during the process of casting a spell or activating an ability, its triggered ability will resolve before that spell or ability.
  
* Zhur-Taa Druid’s last ability isn’t a mana ability. It uses the stack and can be responded to.
