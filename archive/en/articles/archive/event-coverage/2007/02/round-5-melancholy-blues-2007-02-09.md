Jon Sonne and Osyp Lebedowicz were teammates on TOGIT and its variations for years. In fact, they likely counted themselves as friends once, but they had a serious falling out, and the pair have hardly spoken since. That's the background on this draft match of 4-0 Americans.


### Game 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptgen07/R5_Sonne_Osyp.jpg)*Osyp Lebedowicz and Jon Sonne battle for the 5-0 record.*Sonne opened the match action with a turn-two suspended [Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron), while Osyp cast [Prismatic Lens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens) and then [Mana Skimmer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Skimmer). The Skimmer attacked on turn four to put Sonne's lone red source of mana on lock. Osyp followed this with [Skulking Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skulking+Knight) and [Pit Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Keeper), and then smashed a face-down [Brine Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brine+Elemental) with [Orcish Cannonade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Cannonade), taking easy control of the game. 


Unfortunately for Osyp, Sonne found a new source of red and used [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) (plus Ephemeron coming into play) to kill both [Pit Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Keeper) and the Knight and get back in the game.


Osyp shrugged, played [Melancholy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melancholy) on Sonne's lone beastie, and kept swinging with [Mana Skimmer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Skimmer), dropping Sonne to 4. At this point, Osyp forgot to pay upkeep on his [Melancholy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melancholy), forcing him to spend [Smallpox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox) to clear the board and both players' hands. 


The game then became a topdeck race, and one that Osyp had a clear lead in, since he had 18 life to Sonne's 4. Unfortunately, Sonne ripped 3 straight creatures off the top of his deck, while Osyp cast another [Pit Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Keeper) and then Trespasser *il*-Vec. Sonne wiped them both with [Subterranean Shambler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Subterranean+Shambler), giving him an excellent Game 1 comeback.

### Game 2


Game 2 started fast with Osyp throwing down [Goblin Skycutter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Skycutter) and [Simian Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide), but Sonne held the fort with [Dreamscape Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamscape+Artist) and [Dream Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Stalker). After a brief stall, Osyp played [Clockwork Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Hydra), which Sonne killed via [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) plus [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot), tossing the extra point at the Skycutter for good measure. 


At that point, Osyp started drawing nothing but lands, and [Tectonic Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Fiend) from Sonne quickly finished the match.
