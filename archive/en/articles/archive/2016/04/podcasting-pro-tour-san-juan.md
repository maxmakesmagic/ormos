Let Pro Tour Statisician Richard Hagon be your guide through Pro Tour–San Juan, the second Pro Tour of the 2010 season. If you're not a regular reader of event coverage, this is a great starting place to learn the top players and storylines that have shaped this season. With exclusive player interviews, analysis of deckbuilding strategies, explanations of formats and the PT season, and much more, it's a cornucopia of information.

* [**Friday, 10:30 a.m.: The Metagame Runaround**](http://media.wizards.com/2016/podcasts/archive/sj1.mp3) (14.0 MB)

The hour before the Pro Tour is a special time. Almost 400 players are gathered to see who can claim 25 Pro Points, a championship trophy, and the $40,000 first prize. In order to get to the live Sunday Draft Top 8, they'll have to navigate ten rounds of Block Constructed and six rounds of Booster Draft. Will Blue-White Control dominate? Will Eldrazi Green get there? Will Mono-Red burn everyone to a crisp? We pile round the big names at top speed as the clock ticks down towards the opening of Pro Tour-San Juan 2010.


* [**Friday, 4:15 p.m.: Barbecue Belgian Beach House**](http://media.wizards.com/2016/podcasts/archive/sj2.mp3) (14.0 MB)

All over Puerto Rico, groups of pros have gathered to test for the Pro Tour. In a fabulous villa just outside San Juan, a full dozen Europeans from Belgium and the Netherlands have congregated at dawn, dinner, and dusk to draft, break Block, and take advantage of some epic tourism opportunities. From rainforests to red sideboards and snorkelling to Sea Gate Oracles, this is the Belgian Beach House 2010.


* [**Saturday, 10:09 a.m.: Brad Nelson, One Year On**](http://media.wizards.com/2016/podcasts/archive/sj3.mp3) (8.7 MB)

One year ago, Brad Nelson made one of the most anticipated Pro Tour debuts in memory. FFfreak from **Magic Online**, Nelson proved his worth in face-to-face play with a ninth-place finish in Honolulu. Since then he has a Natoinals Top 8, a Grand Prix win and another GP Top 8, has qualified for the 2010 **Magic Online** Championship, and will represent MTGO players around the world at the 2010 Community Cup. Give a listen to one of the most powerful interviews I've had the privilege to conduct here at the home of **Magic**.


* [**Saturday, 5:24 p.m.: Going Live from PT San Juan**](http://media.wizards.com/2016/podcasts/archive/sj4.mp3) (12.9 MB)

It's Round 14, and 48 players have records of 9-4 or better. Beyond them, the remaining players are scrapping for the minor places, but above those with four losses the battle is truly fierce, with Top 8 slots on the line every round. In the Feature Match arena, Guillaume Matignon of France heads the field. He tussles with Brad Nelson in a match that could certainly see the Frenchman into the Top 8, or knock Brad back into the pack. Then there's Hall of Famer Frank Karsten. His analysis of the metagame is simply unrivaled, and he sits at just three losses, still with a good chance of the Top 8. That's if, of course, he can defeat David Ochoa, who just might have other ideas...


* [**Sunday: Interview with Winner Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa**](http://media.wizards.com/2016/podcasts/archive/sjwinner.mp3) (9 MB)

After four previous individual Pro Tour Top 8s ended in disappointing quarterfinal losses, Brazil's Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa finally broke through to capture that elusive Pro Tour win. He shares his thoughts on winning San Juan and much more just minutes after claiming victory.
