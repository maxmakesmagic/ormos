It's no secret that there were some misprints in *Alpha*. These ranged from cards with  or  mana costs to cards that accidentally didn't make it into *Alpha* [Volcanic Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Volcanic%2BIsland) [Circle of Protection: Black](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Circle%2Bof%2BProtection%253A%2BBlack).

But there were a couple of other typos that did get fixed until *Revised*, and they mostly had to do with the problems that arise from nonexistent templating and rules for creature types. [Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis) made sense and didn't present any problems:

![Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lord+of+Atlantis)  
Fine. He doesn't say he's a merfolk, so he doesn't pump himself. But what about [Goblin King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+King), who's supposed to work the same way?

![Goblin King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+King)  
Uh oh! Not only is "goblin" in his name, it's in his type line! It wasn't until *Revised* that he was corrected to say "Summon Lord" instead.

![Goblin King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+King)  
Making this more complicated was the case of the *Alpha* [Goblin Balloon Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Balloon+Brigade), which was supposed to give *itself* flying:

![Goblin Balloon Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Balloon+Brigade)  
What the? This clearly says it gives "goblins" flying. Who's to say it wouldn't give that ability to [Mons's Goblin Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mons%27s+Goblin+Raiders)? Or, for that matter, [Goblin King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+King)? Well, Richard Garfield, that's who! That wasn't his intent, so the wording was changed for *Revised*.
