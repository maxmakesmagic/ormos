Magic Online Legacy Festival: Discover. Assemble. Conquer.

*Magic Online* has festivals to celebrate a format and its players, as well as to encourage others to join in on the fun. Interested in playing Legacy but haven't given it a try? Already play and want to get your friends to join you? This festival is the time!


We thought a lot about what a player potentially interested in a format would want to see to get them from knowing nothing about the format to being fully immersed in it, and we identified these steps:


1. **DISCOVER**: A way to try out the format. Learn about the different decks, see what the metagame is like, and find a deck that you want to play.
2. **ASSEMBLE**: An opportunity to get the cards together that you'll need for your deck.
3. **CONQUER**: Once you've gotten your deck together, a way to play for some sweet prizes when you jump in and take on the competition.

Excited? I hope so. Here's how we're going to help you jump into Legacy:


Discover: Legacy Gauntlet (June 8–16)
=====================================


*Magic* R&D will select some of the best and most-played decks in Legacy, and you'll be able to give them a try in the first-ever Legacy Gauntlet! If you aren't familiar with Gauntlets, for 6 Event Tickets or 60 Play Points, you can test-drive a random deck from a list curated by *Magic* R&D for three Swiss rounds. Prizes will be based on your record.


These events will help you learn about Legacy and decide what deck in the format would be the most fun for you to build. Plus, of course, you can just play a lot of fun matches! The Legacy Gauntlet decklists will be revealed closer to the Gauntlet's launch, and you can see the event details at the bottom of the page.


Assemble: *Eternal Masters* (June 16–July 6)
============================================


*Eternal Masters* releases on *Magic Online* on June 16. There will be multiple ways to experience *Eternal Masters*. You can draft 8-4 Single Elimination, 6-2-2-2 Swiss, or phantom Swiss. Did you want a Competitive Sealed League? Don't worry, there will be a Competitive Sealed League, too! You can see all of the event details at the bottom of this article.


Those looking to get into Legacy will find these events are a great way to help acquire cards for your Legacy decks. Plus, you get to have fun playing *Eternal Masters* Limited!



Conquer: Legacy League (July 6–July 20) and Festival Championship (July 24)
===========================================================================


Want to win a premium foil *and* a non-foil set of each of *Eternal Masters*, *Vintage Masters*, *Modern Masters*, and *Modern Masters 2015 Edition*? That's the prize for first place in the Legacy Festival Championship! There are more prizes as well—see the full event details below!


How do you qualify for this Championship? Well, on June 15 we'll be converting the Legacy League to use the competitive structure instead of the friendly structure it uses today. After *Eternal Masters* events are over, getting five wins in a single Competitive Legacy League course that you complete between July 6 at 10 a.m. PT and July 20 at 10 a.m. PT will qualify you for the Legacy Festival Championship on July 24!


During these two weeks, we'll also be awarding a premium foil [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) promo card to any player who earns five wins in a course in the Competitive Legacy League (and qualifies for the Legacy Festival Championship). Players who earn four wins in a Competitive Legacy League course will receive a non-foil [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) promo card.


Looking for another way to qualify? Good news! There's a [Legacy Challenge](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-format-challenges#Legacy) during this qualification period, on July 9 at 11 a.m. Pacific. If you make Top 16 in that tournament, you can qualify for the Legacy Festival Championship.
