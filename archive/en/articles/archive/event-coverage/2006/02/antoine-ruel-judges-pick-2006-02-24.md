Few groups involved in the Magic Pro Tour see and hear as much as the judges. Once again, we asked them to select a player for this year's Invitational.


To determine which players would make it onto the judges' ballot, a nomination form was sent to all Level 3 and higher judges with the names of all Pro players with 30 or more Pro Points. The judges nominated five players who best combined sportsmanship and playing skill.


Taking the top 10 names from the nomination process, we then asked the same body of judges for a single vote from this field of candidates:


* Antonino De Rosa, Tsuyoshi Fujita, Anton Jonsson, Raphael Levy, Gabriel Nassif, Julien Nuijten, Masashi Oiso, Antoine Ruel, Geoffrey Siron, Jelger Wiegersma

Congratulations to Antoine Ruel, the 2006 Judges' Pick!
