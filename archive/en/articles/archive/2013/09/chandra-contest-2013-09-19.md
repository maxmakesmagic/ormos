Chandra Contest
===============



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on September 19, 2013 










As you might know, Magic 2014—Duels of the Planeswalkers [launched this week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1263). Launching a game title on five platforms at once is seriously hard work. It also takes a surprising amount of incineration, combustion, and a general need for burning things. In other words, Chandra's work schedule is completely full. Wizards of the Coast has started interviewing stand-in Planeswalkers to take care of minor tasks such as photo shoots, publicity appearances, autographs, and feeding the office basilisk. This is where you come in. Enter a photo of you auditioning to be a Planeswalker, and you could win a sweet prize!


Submissions (one entry per person) received from June 28, 2013, through September 9, 2013, are eligible to participate. The grand-prize winner chozen by Wizards will receive a trip for two to the PAX of his or her choice in 2014. The grand-prize winner will also select a WPN store of his or her choice to win a pizza party. Ten runner-up finalists could be voted the fan-favorite winner, who will win the second-place prize of a laptop with *Magic 2014—Duels of the Planeswalkers*.
