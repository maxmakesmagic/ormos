Players are shuffling up for Day Two and I took the liberty of taking a walk through the top tables to get a bird's eye view of the top half of the field.

It is evident that Esper Control remains the most popular deck today, the only deck in the format that is able to support hand disruption, card advantage, countermagic and a removal suite (complete with quality spot removal and board sweepers). Talk about being greedy! Some players who love their [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)s as much as their stable manabases have opted to eschew [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), opting for a more consistent Azorius Control build.

*25% of the top half of the field love their [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)s* !


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


Black Control decks continue to dominate and it is a close call whether or not white should be splashed to support game-enders like [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa) and Obzedat Ghost Council. Regardless of their choice, expect to be on the receiving end of a pack of [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s at the very least.

Blue Devotion decks are also seen to be evolving to support white mana and [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) is now being played alongside newfound friend [Ephara, God of the Polis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephara%2C+God+of+the+Polis). It seems like the introduction of [Temple of Enlightenment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Enlightenment) is also a considerable push factor that nudged Mono-Blue Devotion players towards Blue-White.

*Best Friends Forever!*


 



 


Rounding off the rest of the field include less conventional decks like Selesnya Aggro and Rakdos Aggro and rogue brews like BG "Dredge" and [Kiora](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave) Control!
