Streamer Showdown Is Back Jan. 25!


Another Streamer Showdown is coming up on Thursday, January 25, and it's our first Showdown to feature the newly released *Rivals of Ixalan*! Watch a group of delightful personalities from the *Magic* community swashbuckle, hornswoggle, and stampede their way through the new set. Whether you're looking to gain more insight into the Limited environment or just hoping to see someone cast [Polyraptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polyraptor) into [Forerunner of the Empire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forerunner+of+the+Empire) and fill the world with Dinosaurs, you don't want to miss it!


If you've never watched one before, Streamer Showdowns consist of two eight-player events (one at 1 p.m. PT, the other at 5 p.m. PT) featuring talented streamers from all across the *Magic* community. The two pods are detailed below:


**Pod 1 (1 p.m.)**

*Rivals of Ixalan* Is Out Now
-----------------------------


Rivals of Ixalan is upon us! The new set is available for purchase in the *Magic Online* store, and Leagues and events are in full swing, so you can get your fill of Pirates, Dinosaurs, Merfolk, Vampires, plundering, exploring, and Orazca-ing whenever you want.

MOCS Monthly Events Jan. 27 and 28
----------------------------------


This weekend brings two events in the *Magic Online* Championship Series. On Saturday, January 27, a Standard tournament will kick off at 7 a.m. Then, on Sunday, January 28, the format will be *Rivals of Ixalan*-*Ixalan* Sealed, also beginning at 7 a.m.


Players can enter either event with 35 Qualifier Points (QPs), and top finishers qualify for the Playoff Event on February 10.


Monthly and Playoff Events also award top players MOCS Leaderboard Points for the year. Top players on the [Leaderboard](http://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/leaderboard) at the end of the 2018 MOCS will qualify for the year-end Championship event.

Redemption Updates: Tuesday Processing, *Amonkhet*, and *Ixalan*
----------------------------------------------------------------


Starting January 30, redemptions will be processed at Tuesday morning at 3 a.m. PT instead of their current time of Thursday morning at 3 a.m. PT. This change gives our warehouse team more time to process orders prior to the weekend and should provide a slightly faster delivery time.


*Amonkhet* reprints have been ordered and processed, and should be available for purchase in the *Magic Online* Store by the end of February or beginning of March. This new print run will be available while supplies last.


An *Ixalan* reprint has also been ordered, but we don't have an ETA on when they will arrive in the store at this time.
