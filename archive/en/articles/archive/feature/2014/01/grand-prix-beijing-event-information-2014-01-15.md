* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

Svetlin Velinov is well-known illustrator and concept artist who lives in Varna, Bulgaria on the beautiful Black Sea coast. He graduated in with a fine arts degree from the National School of Arts "Dobri Hristov" and animation directing in "New Bulgarian University" in Sofia, but found his early inspiration and motives to start drawing in comics from his childhood. During his education in animation he has worked in advertising industry as graphic designer but shortly after his graduation in 2003 he started to build his professional career working as a freelance artist. With his experience over the years he developed his own well-recognizable style which is a mixture of his fine art approach to the digital illustration and the comics stylization of his characters, binding those two components into something which uniquely personalizes his own style.
