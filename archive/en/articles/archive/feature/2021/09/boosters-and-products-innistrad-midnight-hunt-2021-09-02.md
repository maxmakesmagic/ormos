On September 24, [*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/midnight-hunt) releases in stores around the world, and it's packed with creatures that howl in the night—and the people who fight them.


Whether you're excited to draft the latest set, discover new choices for your next deck, or collect the most exciting and exclusive cards of the set, you can have it all with *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*.


Set Boosters
============


![Set Booster Display](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/GgNKqLA2SC.png)


![Set Booster](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/Mk2hdn5gbk.png)


Set Boosters are awesome ways to expand—or get started with—your *Magic* collection. Each Set Booster tells a "story" of sorts, with thematically connected common and uncommon cards, an art card showing off some of the incredible visuals throughout the set, and a guaranteed traditional foil card in every booster, plus opportunities to open more than one rare or mythic rare and a card from *The List—*cards from across *Magic* history that feel right at home in the set.


We made two changes for *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Set Boosters to make them even cooler to open.


First, we're changing up *The List* even more than before. For *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*, we're swapping 75 cards instead of 50 to pack in more flavor and fun when you open one of these cards. New cards on *The List* this time include [Mortify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortify), [Early Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest), [Witch of the Moors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witch+of+the+Moors), and [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb)—each feeling right at home in an Innistrad set.


Second, beyond changing up *The List* further, we're adding more to the cards you open elsewhere in Set Boosters. Now you can also open the four new legendary creature "face" cards in *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Commander decks plus new-to-*Magic* Commander cards that aren't found in the *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Commander decks!


Here are the new-to-*Magic* Commander cards you can find in Set Boosters:

![Visions of Dread](https://media.wizards.com/2021/mid/en_PJZRY66qJH.png)![Curse of Obsession](https://media.wizards.com/2021/mid/en_hZt4mw89sr.png)![Visions of Ruin](https://media.wizards.com/2021/mid/en_IGpmn2D3ov.png)

*(\*These cards will only be found in* Innistrad: Midnight Hunt *Set and Collector Boosters.)*


New cards to play with are always exciting but not every card can fit into or be balanced for a Standard set with Draft Boosters, such as cards designed for Commander. With Set Boosters—and Collector Boosters, see below—we can include more cool cards in more colors for Commander players (beyond the two *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Commander decks) and add more to discover when you open an additional rare or mythic rare in a Set Booster.


Expanding your collection with the latest set is easy with Set Boosters. Here's what you can find inside those for *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*:


* 1 Rare or mythic rare card
	+ Can be a double-faced card
* 1 Traditional foil card of any rarity
	+ Can be a double-faced card
	+ Can be a showcase equinox, showcase eternal night, or borderless card
* 2 Cards from a variety of possibilities:
	+ *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* cards, including single- and double-faced cards, of any rarity
	+ Booster Fun variants (showcase equinox, showcase eternal night, and borderless cards)
	+ *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Commander cards (including Commander cards exclusive to Set and Collector Boosters)
* 2 Common or uncommon cards, each either double-faced or a showcase equinox card
* 2 Uncommon single-faced cards
* 3 Common single-faced cards
* 1 Eternal night basic land, non-foil or traditional foil
* 1 Token or ad card; *or* 1 card from *The List*
* 1 Art card or foil-stamped art card

![Set Booster contents](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/en_7hYwehy23F.jpg)


Approximately 27% of *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Set Boosters contain two (2) rare or mythic rare cards, 3% contain three (3), and it's even possible to open four (4), though that's less than 1% of the time. Set Boosters are available individually and in displays of 30 boosters. If you purchase a display, you may be eligible for this traditional foil Buy-a-Box promo. You can find out [at your local game store](https://locator.wizards.com/).

Draft Boosters are the tried-and-true way to open boosters to battle other players. With seven other players, you can draft boosters one at a time, build a deck, and play, or just open six Draft Boosters with an opponent to craft your deck to play—and you can even open sweet Booster Fun variants, too.


Here's what you can find inside the *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Draft Booster:

![MID DFC Helper card](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/en_r9FC0RcBGI.png)


Every *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Draft Booster contains two double-faced cards—a common card and either an uncommon or a rare or mythic rare card.


In 33% of Draft Boosters, a traditional foil card of any rarity replaces a common. This can be any card in the set, including double-faced cards, or any borderless, showcase eternal night, or showcase equinox card.
