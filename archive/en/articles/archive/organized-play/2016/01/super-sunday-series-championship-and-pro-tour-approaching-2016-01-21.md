The very first weekend with *Oath of the Gatewatch* in stores is going to be an exciting one. The 2016 Super Sunday Series Championship is taking place this weekend, and it'll be one of the very first events to feature the new Standard and Booster Draft formats.


And, in a little over two weeks, we'll see *Oath of the Gatewatch* at its most amped-up at the Pro Tour, with this set being touted as one to shake up the Modern format. For anyone stopping by the [Pro Tour in Atlanta](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/ogw), we've got a preview of some of the brand-new merch that'll be available.


2016 Super Sunday Series Championship
=====================================


During the Sunday of every Grand Prix, starting with [Grand Prix Madrid](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/grand-prix-madrid-2015) and [Baltimore](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbal15) in December 2014 and ending with [Grand Prix Kōbe](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpkob15) and [Pittsburgh](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppit15) in November 2015, players who were unable to make it to Day Two had the opportunity to play in a side event that has quickly become a Grand Prix staple: the Super Sunday Series.


The Super Sunday Series is chance number two for players to get a memorable win from the weekend, as the Super Sunday Series winners qualify for a special championship event that takes place each year at Wizards of the Coast headquarters. Those qualified players are flown out and put up in a hotel near Wizards HQ, where they get to compete in the Super Sunday Series Championship for their share of a $20,000 prize pool. On top of that, they get treated to dinners during their stay, have the opportunity to meet and greet employees from Wizards of the Coast, and have access to a *lot* of Draft product.


The 2016 Super Sunday Series Championship takes place this weekend, and nearly 60 players will be flying out for a lot of fun and potentially a few thousand bucks. The tournament will start on Saturday, and will consist of:


* Three rounds of *Oath of the Gatewatch*-*Battle for Zendikar* Booster Draft
* Four rounds of Standard (remember, *Oath of the Gatewatch* is legal, and this weekend's competitors will have a chance to borrow any cards from the new set that they want to use from us!)

After those seven rounds, the tournament will cut to a Top 8 showcasing another *Oath of the Gatewatch*-*Battle for Zendikar* Booster Draft. The winner will receive $6,000 and a trophy. Oh, and a photo with Mitzy, our lobby dragon.

You'll be able to see highlight clips from the weekend on the [@Wizards\_Magic](http://www.twitter.com/wizards_magic) Twitter page. I'll be there doing text coverage, and you better believe I'll be bringing you any new Standard brews that show up.


This year's Super Sunday Series Championship crowd includes:


* Last year's Super Sunday Series champion, Luis Salvatto
* [Grand Prix Oakland 2016](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpoak16) Champion Reid Duke
* Platinum Pro Sam Black
* [Grand Prix Vegas 2013](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gplv13) winner and regular streamer Neal Oliver
* [2015 World *Magic* Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2015WMC) Champion team captain Marco Cammilluzzi
* Danish *Magic* regulars Christoffer Larsen and Tina Dahl
* And many more!

Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* Merch and More
===============================================


We're a little over two weeks away from Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*. As players and teams dive into the new Booster Draft format, as well as the impact of the set and the recent bannings on Modern, we've been locking up some plans for this show.


For those in the Atlanta area: the Pro Tour is open to the public for viewing purposes! The Pro Tour tournament area is structured in such a way that the vast majority of matches are able to be viewed from the sidelines. Got someone you want to cheer on? Feel free to do so from the rails.


While we will not be running any side events at the Pro Tour, we will have viewing areas set up for those who want to watch the broadcast between rounds. Our merch booth also has a ton of new Pro Tour–exclusive items. Like these mana symbol baseball T-shirts!

And these Planeswalker baseball caps!

A new T-shirt has also been created to commemorate the 2015-16 premier play season.

Oh, and there's also a sweet new T-shirt featuring Kiora.

And finally, when it comes to event exclusives, our playmat is always a popular pick, with this one featuring the Atlanta skyline and Nissa.

These are all items that you can purchase exclusively at the Pro Tour.


If you're looking for an epic viewing experience, then be sure to drop in on Sunday, as we'll be broadcasting the Top 8 coverage via projector, with expanded seating for everyone looking to experience the Pro Tour coverage in a live audience. Our commentators for Top 8 match coverage will also be out in the viewing area, so cheer on your favorite competitor with fans and Pro Tour competitors alike!


The Pro Tour is only a little over two weeks away. If you're in the Atlanta area February 5–7 and would like to stop by, you can get the full event information [at this page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/ogw). Maybe we'll see you there!
