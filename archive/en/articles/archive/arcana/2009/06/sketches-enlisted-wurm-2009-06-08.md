Welcome to another edition of Sketches! Today we look at the process behind illustrating that unwilling recruit, [Enlisted Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlisted+Wurm)!

### Artist Portfolio

Artist [Steve Prescott](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Steve%20Prescott%22%5D) has illustrated 58 **Magic** cards, and they're all cool.

### Art Description

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions given to Steve for [Enlisted Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlisted+Wurm):


> *Color: Green and white creature  
>  Location: Grixis  
>  Action: A wurm of Jund (styleguide p. 63) has been 'trained' and armored by the knights of Bant. Now it's their siege weapon. Show this wurm rearing up to smash through a decrepit necropolis. Several human Bant "handlers" hold tethers tied to the wurm and they're using them to try to keep it pointed in the right direction.  
>  Focus: the armored wurm  
>  Mood: their control over it is tenuous at best.* 
> 
> 
> 

The next step is for the artist to submit sketches of his or her vision of the art description.

### Sketches

Here's Steve's initial sketch submitted for the wurm:

### Final Art

Isn't that a great sketch? It's clear, precise, and easy to envision the final piece. There were no changes requested, and the final version looks exactly right:

### Finished Card

And here's the card in its final state, as you can find in booster packs of *Alara Reborn*!
