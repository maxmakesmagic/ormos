 Yichao is a writer of words for plays, television, theme parks, and—most recently—Magic: The Gathering. He loves Cube Draft and corgis. 






Nissa first appeared in the original *Zendikar* block. We've seen [some of her adventures since then](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/nissa-worldwaker-2014-06-25), but her origin story is told in full for the [first time today](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/nissa%E2%80%99s-origin-home-2015-07-08). Nissa has been a relatively shy Planeswalker until now, appearing on very few cards and pieces of art—but all of that changes with *Magic Origins*.

When we first met Nissa, she was primarily concerned with her tribe on Zendikar.
