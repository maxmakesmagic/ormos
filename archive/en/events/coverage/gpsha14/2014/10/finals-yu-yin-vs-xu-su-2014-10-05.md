After competing in seventeen matches, both players have proven that they are two of the best in the entire room. However their day was not over. They had just one more match to go. The most important one yet.


Both Yu Yin and Xu Su have already qualified for Pro Tour Fate Reforged, scheduled to take place in Washington D.C. next Spring. In fact, all the Top 8 competitors have.


This was a different fight. A fight that would enshrine the winner for eternity in the annals of history. A Champion title was at stake. For honor! For glory! For Tarkir!


Game 1
======


Yu passed his first two turns and was forced to recruit [Mardu Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hordechief) without raiding. That was followed by [Salt Road Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salt+Road+Patrol), [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer) and [Mardu Hateblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hateblade). All Xu had was a [Monastery Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Flock) and [Snowhorn Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snowhorn+Rider).


The spectators cringed when Abzan Ascendency buffed Yu's entire army, but Xu remained composed as always. Using [Savage Punch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Punch) to kill [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer), it was still entirely possible to hold the fort.


That was until Yu proceeded to empty Xu's hand with [Rakshasa's Secret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa%27s+Secret), before adding a 6/6 [Kin-Tree Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Invocation) token onto the battlefield. At the end of his line, Xu's best play was to tap down the token using a topdecked [Winterflame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winterflame), killing [Mardu Hateblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hateblade).


This gave Yu a second Spirit token. All this while, Yu was holding [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm), preferring to play it safe by attacking with the spirits two by two. He's bound to get there somehow and didn't need to use the charm needlessly.


Sure enough, Xu tried a second copy of [Savage Punch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Punch), and Yu responded by exiling [Snowhorn Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snowhorn+Rider). Yu was waiting for this blowout. Eventually, the pair of tokens finished Xu off.

**Yu Yin 1 – Xu Su 0**


Game 2
======


The final game of Grand Prix Shanghai took no more than ten minutes.


Yu summoned [Mardu Hateblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hateblade) on turn one, followed by Ainok Bon-kin on turn two, followed by Abzan Ascendency on turn 3.

Just like that, he was facing five power of first-striking damage by turn three.


Do the math, Xu went down to 19 on Turn 2, and was reduced to 14 on Turn 3. When he tried chumping with [Jeskai Windscout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Windscout), Yu used [Awaken the Bear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awaken+the+Bear) to trample over a significant chunk of damage.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsha14/Finals-Xu-Su.jpg)*Xu's chances of victory are bleak, but he remains sporting and jovial.* 



Despite finding [Monastery Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Flock) and [Embodiment of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embodiment+of+Spring), Xu was no where close to winning. Yu continued his assault, summoning [Mardu Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hordechief) and [War Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Behemoth).


That was the final nail in the coffin and Xu extended his hand.


**Yu Yin 2 – Xu Su 0**


**Congratulations Yu Yin, our newly minted Grand Prix Shanghai 2014 Champion!**
