*Ultimate Masters*: *Magic Online* Edition
------------------------------------------


On December 6, you can play *Ultimate Masters* Draft events on MTGO before the set's official December 7 release.


Check out Alli's [release article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/ultimate-masters-magic-online-edition-2018-11-28) from last week to catch up on everything you need to know about its arrival and consequent *Magic Online* updates.




---

Treasure Chest Updates
----------------------


When we come up from tomorrow's downtime, the Treasure Chests will be updated with new contents. Check out the changes on [this page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info) after the updates go live on December 5.




---

New Feature—Hide Chat
---------------------


With Wednesday's deployment, we're adding a new feature to *Magic Online*: the ability to hide game chat while leaving your game log visible. In fact, chat will be hidden by default now. If you get a message during a game, however, the chat button will turn yellow to let you know. If you want to see the message, you can click the button and "Show Chat."

If you would like to opt out of these notifications altogether, you can select "Ignore Chat" instead. This will prevent you from getting any chat notifications at all. Of course, if you change your mind, you can reverse your selections at any time using the chat options.

If you've opted to show your chat, you can hide it again by clicking the chat button and selecting "Hide Chat." We've also given you the ability to show and hide your Game Log from this menu as well.


Finally, if you'd rather not be bothered by opponents who aren't are on your buddy list, you can go into your Account settings, and, in the "Buddies, Clan, and Chat" section, select the "Game Chat: Allow Only Buddies" option. This will disable your chat automatically for all future matches, unless you are battling someone on your buddies list.

We hope this feature lets you better tailor MTGO to how you like to play. Happy gaming!

Premier Event Housekeeping During Downtime
------------------------------------------


We have several reminders for you regarding items that allow entry into Premier events:


* Qualifier Points (QPs) earned for the 2018 season will be removed from accounts during Wednesday's downtime. QPs earned after December 2, 8 a.m. PT, count toward the 2019 season and will remain in your account following downtime.
* Limited PTQ Entry Tokens that have expired (the Blue ones) will also be removed during downtime. All Red Tokens remain usable to enter Limited PTQ Finals through the beginning of March. After downtime, PTQ Preliminary events will again give out Blue Tokens as prizes.
* Format Points (FPs)—rewards for high finishes in Format Challenges and some Competitive Leagues—also began accumulating on December 2. We will keep track of them internally, then they will be granted to your account once *Ravnica Allegiance* is added to MTGO in January!



---

Last Day of Modern Cube
-----------------------


The Modern Cube is a great way to try out all the iconic cards and synergies that shape one of *Magic*'s most dynamic formats. Modern Cube can be found in the Limited Leagues section of the Play Lobby and will run through December 6, with the start of *Ultimate Masters* events.


For event details, and to see the complete card list and the latest changes to it, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/modern-cube-cardlist). Happy Cubing!




---

1v1 Commander Changes
---------------------


As of tomorrow, December 5, we will be ending all event support for 1v1 Commander. While we understand this is a last-minute change, we feel it's necessary to highlight our most successful online formats and bring you the best of those every week.




---

Saturday RPTQ
-------------


A *Magic Online* Regional Pro Tour Qualifier (RPTQ) will take place this Saturday, December 8 at 2 p.m. PT and will use Modern format. These events are only open to players who qualified via in-store Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier events, and pre-registration is required.

Sunday PTQ
----------
