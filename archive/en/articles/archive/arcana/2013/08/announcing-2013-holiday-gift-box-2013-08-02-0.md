You like presents, right? And if you like presents *and*
 **Magic**, but your well-meaning loved ones are stymied by the collision of those two things, you can point them in the direction of the 2013 Holiday Gift Box!

The box itself can hold more than 2,000 **Magic** cards and is available worldwide in English on November 15, 2013. You do get more than just a beautiful box to store your cards in for the MSRP of $19.99, though! To wit:

* Four *Theros* booster packs
* Beautiful storage box that can hold more than 2,000 Magic cards
* Twenty *Theros* basic lands
* Six illustrated plastic dividers
* Sticker sheet for customizing the dividers
* An alternate-art Karametra's Acolyte from the *Theros* set

(No, sorry, we can't tell you yet what Karametra's Acolyte is. You might guess it's a spiffy **Magic** card, though, and you'd be right!)
