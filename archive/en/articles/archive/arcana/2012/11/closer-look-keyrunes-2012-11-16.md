The five keyrunes are literally emblematic of their guilds. Let's learn more about them, through the magic of art descriptions and finished art!


### Azorius


![Azorius Keyrune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Azorius+Keyrune)
> Color: Artifact associated with white and blue (Azorius guild)
> 
> 
> Action: This is one of ten ceremonial artifacts crafted to resemble an abstract "key." There is one such "mana key" for each guild, and this is the one for the Azorius guild. It's about 1 foot (30cm) long and is made of carved stone, perhaps white marble with round blue gemstone elements. One end of the key looks like the head, wings, and chest of an eagle or griffin, with some kind of stylized key-shaft leading down from the carved creature.

### Izzet

> Color: Artifact associated with blue and red (Izzet guild)

> 
> Action: This is one of ten ceremonial artifacts crafted to resemble an abstract "key." There is one such "mana key" for each guild, and this is the one for the Izzet guild. It's about 1 foot (30cm) long and is made of carved stone, perhaps made of polished crimson and blue stone. One end of the key is carved to resemble a stylized elemental, perhaps a ragged lightning-bolt shape or the head shape of one of the Izzet elementals on p. 69. A stylized key-shaft leads down from the carved elemental "head." Focus: The magical stone key

### Rakdos

> Color: Artifact associated with black and red (Rakdos guild)
> 
> 
> Action: This is one of ten ceremonial artifacts crafted to resemble an abstract "key." There is one such "mana key" for each guild, and this is the one for the Rakdos guild. It's about 1 foot (30cm) long and is made of carved stone, perhaps dark granite marbled with veins of blood-red crystal. One end of the key looks like a stylized head of a grinning Rakdos devil (see p. 87), with some kind of stylized key-shaft leading down from the head.

### Golgari

> Action: This is one of ten ceremonial artifacts crafted to resemble an abstract "key." There is one such "mana key" for each guild, and this is the one for the Golgari guild. It's about 1 foot (30cm) long and is made of carved stone, perhaps deep green jade with black onyx veins. One end of the key looks like a stylized Golgari insect (see pp. 113-114), with some kind of stylized key-shaft leading down from the carved insect.
