Sometimes, you want a cleaver. For example, [Ogre's Cleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre%27s+Cleaver) from *Rise of the Eldrazi*.

That's a powerful weapon. In fact, it looks like it might be too large for the elf (not a human, even though that's what this paragraph originally said) holding it. It would look better in the hands of an ogre, which makes a certain amount of sense. And this, of course, is where we show you a very similar cleaver as it appeared in the art of an ogre in an earlier set!
