[_metadata_:description]:- "We have discovered an issue within the Magic Online client that affects the Collection Scene, specifically trade binders. Upon opening the client, if players navigate directly to the Collection Scene and open a trade binder, right-click context menus will not display. As far as internal testing shows, all other context menus elsewhere in the client are unaffected. We plan on deploying a fix for this issue during the Wednesday, November 5 downtime. Luckily, there is a simple workaround in the meantime."

We have discovered an issue within the *Magic Online* client that affects the Collection Scene, specifically trade binders. Upon opening the client, if players navigate directly to the Collection Scene and open a trade binder, right-click context menus will not display. As far as internal testing shows, all other context menus elsewhere in the client are unaffected. We plan on deploying a fix for this issue during the Wednesday, November 5 downtime. Luckily, there is a simple workaround in the meantime.


This issue only occurs if trade binders are the first place that a user navigates to after opening *Magic Online*. If you are not currently able to see right-click context menus within trade binders, remain on the Collection Scene, open another deck, and context menus should be visible again.


Thank you for your patience while we investigate this issue. We will update the community if we discover anything new.
