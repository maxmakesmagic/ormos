Starting this Saturday (May 3, 2014) there will be a number of events available to enter on **Magic Online** where the entry fee will be zero event tickets!


You read that right! ZERO! That means you don't have to pay anything to enter, including product!


We are doing these events as a test to our system as additional testing as we move back towards restoring paper-linked premier play to **Magic Online**. You can read [Worth Wollpert's article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg_daily_other_04282014_testevents&date=4/28/2014) on the **Magic Online** website.


An important note from Worth's article is about the fact that these events are true tests:



> In addition to giving promo cards to all who participate, these events will have prizes awarded to the players who do well in them, as normal. Note that these will be true tests and therefore this will result in some people (purposefully) getting removed from the events, clock timers being manipulated for some/all players, and other things like that, and players affected in this way will not be compensated further beyond their participation prizes. As I said, these test events are designed to stress some of the many changes weâ€™ve made to the system and to our staffing to make your experiences more reliable.



What promo is he talking about? This one:

While these events don't get started until Saturday, entry will open on Wednesday, April 30, 2014, at 2:00 PM PDT. Hop in the queue and secure your spot!
