Here comes the *Coldsnap* Fat Pack, in the tradition of such fondly-remembered products as the [9th Edition Fat Pack](/en/node/608941) and the [*Ravnica* Fat Pack](/en/articles/archive/ravnica-fat-pack-2005-09-19)!

Pretty stylish, right? Here's a tour: 

* Two card boxes (standing on end in the back)
* The *Coldsnap* Player's Guide, with images of every card in the set and background information on the set available nowhere else (on the left, featuring a picture of a large man with an even larger axe)
* One [Pro Player Card](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/playercards)
* Six color dividers to keep your cards separated in the card boxes
* A *Coldsnap* Spindown life counter
* A 40-card *Coldsnap* basic land pack -- and these lands are *Snow-covered*!
* Six *Coldsnap* boosters
* Jeff Grubb's classic *Ice Age* novel *The Gathering Dark*, one of the most popular **Magic** novels ever.
