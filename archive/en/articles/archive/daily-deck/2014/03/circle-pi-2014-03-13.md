Today is [Pi Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day). In American notation we write the holiday as 3/14, which leads to this nerdy name for the day. In honor of the day, I want to talk to you about circles, rings, and other corner-less shapes.

To talk about the Circle of Protections we have to go back to *Ninth Edition*. Up to this set, when the five original Circle of Protections were printed it was always all five; with *Ninth Edition* that was changed to only feature white's two enemy colors: Black and Red.

However, the original Circle of Protections are far from the only round objects in **Magic**. How about [Oblivion Ring?](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring%3F) It was first printed in *Lorwyn* and unless you were paying attention you might have missed the ring:

Circles are a regular appearance in **Magic**, showing up in art regularly even if the card isn't named with something round. I'm sure as you go digging through card art you'll discover circles you never noticed before, perhaps at quite a... surprising ratio?
