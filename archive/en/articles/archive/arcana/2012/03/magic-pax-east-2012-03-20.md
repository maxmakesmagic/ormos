[![PAX East](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/932_paxeast.jpg)](http://east.paxsite.com/)Are you going to [PAX East](http://east.paxsite.com/)? If you are, there are a lot of **Magic**-related things you'll want to know about. If you're not, you can use this opportunity to construct an elaborate fantasy life in which you *are* going!


First of all, you know the bag you get when you show up? It usually has a program in it and some handouts? This year, it's **Magic**-themed! And it's really nice, too. It's got a drawstring that turns it into a backpack. You'll enjoy it! It's got a little **Magic**-themed surprise in it that we can't tell you about yet. But here's a hint: *You wear it on your head*. Now, here are some things we *can* tell you about.


**The Magic: The Gathering Booth**: It will be full of **Magic**! And it wil also be full of **Magic** swag from Red Monkey, Incipio, and Mighty Fine. Take a look at the [kind of thing we're talking about](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/resources/licensing) and then stop by the booth to buy some!


**The Magic: The Gathering Panel**: Saturday, April 7, from 4:30-5:30 in the Cat Theater. We can't tell you everything that's going to happen there, but we can definitely tell you that there will be *Avacyn Restored* previews. And other things!


**The Magic Online Cube**: For 64 lucky players, it starts at 4:00 PM on Friday in the LAN Area. [Here's more information](/en/articles/archive/magic-online-cube-2012-03-13). And about an hour after it starts at PAX East, it'll be playable across all of **Magic Online**!


**Team Unicorn**: Play both paper **Magic** and **Duels of the Planeswalkers** against [Team Unicorn](http://teamunicornftw.com/) at our booth!


**Playing Magic**: There's an Intro Pack League. There are eight-player tournaments all weekend long. There are Commander tournaments. There are *Limited* Commander tournaments. There are drafts where each player receives three random boosters. There's Legacy. There's Minimaster. In fact, here's [the full list](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/paxeast2012).
