First, there was Brazil. People like Carlos Romão and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa made waves internationally and added another continent to the *Magic* scene—South America. Later countries like Chile and Argentina began to make their presence known abroad, starting to give Brazil a run for their money. You can tell this was felt because more Grand Prix events came to the area. More and more we are seeing events in Santiago and Buenos Aires regularly.



But there has been another country, bubbling under the surface, and in the last couple years has forced itself into the international conversation. I’m talking about Uruguay. In two of the last three World *Magic* Cup tournaments, they finished in the Top 16 (and had a heart-breaking final day last year to miss Top 8), and Sebastin Martinez finished in the Top 8 of the last Grand Prix Buenos Aires. The small community has just started making waves.



Perusing the standings here at the Grand Prix, you are almost smacked with the large amount of Uruguayans, especially considering how small the country is. And right near the top of the standings, sitting and 7-1, were Uruguayans’ Matias Rouband, Matias Urbon, and Ceasar Giacosa. There were all piloting their decks very well, and I stopped for a chat with some of the players to see what the deal is just south of Brazil. However, it proved difficult to talk to just one player, because the other players were all so close and so excited, each time I started to talk to one of them, more and more just appeared—eager to share their joy about the growing community of Uruguay *Magic*.

“We have about 40 people here for Uruguay,” Joaquin Fuentes said. Though that might not seem like a large number, it is when you consider what he said next. “We only have about 60 *Magic* players in the country.” Literally two-thirds of their entire *Magic* community came out to Grand Prix Buenos Aires. This was pretty astonishing to me, but all the other players just smiled and nodded in agreement. Of course they all came; that’s just how they roll.



Diego Prato told me why it happens that way. “It’s one of the advantages of living in a small country—we all know each other very well.” Their shared enthusiasm was infectious. When Prato was called for a feature match against Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, the entire Uruguay contingent cheered raucously. Prato continued on the closeness, “When Gavin Verhey [from *Magic* R&D] came to our store this week, within an hour, he was eating dinner with us a restaurant and watching the game; he met peoples’ parents too. We all became friends. That’s just how it is in a small country.”



Though Uruguayan *Magic* clearly focuses on communal participation, based on their recent results, it also focusing on winning, and encouraging the community to get better at the game. As friends do better, they help everyone grow. Prato said, “There are about fifteen people trying really hard to get into the game, and they are getting very good—I’m not one of them,” he laughed.

Fuentes, one of the fifteen, said, “It’s super-encouraging to see all your friends do well. It shows you that you can do it too.” Everyone else in the group agreed wholeheartedly (at this time the group had grown to about eight or nine). Once the first person does it, anyone can do it—it sounds like this is how a lot of the community felt about Sebastin Martinez’ recent finishes. It’s the classic “Four-Minute Mile” idea. It was considered impossible to run a mile in four minutes. But once one guy did it, people starting do it all over. At the World *Magic* Cup, Team Uruguay is starting to get used to finishing in the Top 16. Once they break that Top 8 barrier, there might be no looking back.



There are still many hurdles for Uruguayan *Magic*. A large economic crisis a decade ago shook the country to its core. That’s when a lot of *Magic* players put their cards in a dresser somewhere. Card availability can still be an issue to this day. But the country has been on the rebound, and many players, like Martin Castillo (World *Magic* Cup competitor in both 2012 and 2014) have found there way back to the game. Not only is a great, strategic game, with the community they all share, it’s a way to bond further.



Another thing Prato said that is good about small countries is that, “we all have problems, but it’s easy to put them aside and band together.” Because there is only one major store in the country, no matter where people are scattered throughout Montevideo and beyond, they all come together to play. (Although players made sure that I note that the player base is outgrowing the space available in just one store—someone in Uruguay should get on that.)

Not only is the community of players growing, but their competitive streak is real. When Diego Prato told me he lost to Damo da Rosa in the feature match, I said in consolation, “Well, you can’t feel too bad losing to the only Hall-of-Famer in the room.” But I was immediately corrected. Fuentes said, “Yeah, but that’s the wrong way to think about it. Every loss is a loss.” He was absolutely right, and showed me why I’m the writer, and they are the players. These guys are in it to win it, and aren’t about to let a Pro Tour Hall of Fame badge stand in their way.



With a home store full to the brim, and websites like Win & In (winandin.net) provide content digitally as well, though Uruguay *Magic* is still a small tree, it’s reaching for the sky—and with the strong camaraderie they share, there’s no telling how tall they can grow.
