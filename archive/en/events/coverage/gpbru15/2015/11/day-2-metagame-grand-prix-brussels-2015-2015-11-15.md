The numbers are in! 226 decklists have all been accounted for and counted, checked and categorized. Now we know what the people on Day 2 of this Grand Prix chose to play. Take a look!




| Deck | # | % |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Abzan | 62 | 27.4 |
| Dark Jeskai | 25 | 11.1 |
| Blue Abzan | 18 | 8.0 |
| Esper Dragons | 16 | 7.1 |
| Atarka Red | 15 | 6.6 |
| Rally the Ancestors | 13 | 5.8 |
| Eldrazi Ramp | 12 | 5.3 |
| Esper Control | 11 | 4.9 |
| Esper Tokens | 10 | 4.4 |
| R/G Landfall | 8 | 3.5 |
| Bant Megamorph | 7 | 3.1 |
| Abzan Tokens | 3 | 1.3 |
| Jund Elves | 3 | 1.3 |
| Mardu | 3 | 1.3 |
| Temur Dragons | 3 | 1.3 |
| W/B Aggro | 3 | 1.3 |
| Bring to Light | 2 | 0.9 |
| Jeskai | 2 | 0.9 |
| Abzan Landfall | 1 | 0.4 |
| Abzan Megamorph | 1 | 0.4 |
| Hardened Scales | 1 | 0.4 |
| Bant Tokens | 1 | 0.4 |
| Grixis Dragons | 1 | 0.4 |
| Jund Midrange | 1 | 0.4 |
| R/B Dragons | 1 | 0.4 |
| Red Abzan | 1 | 0.4 |
| Red Sultai | 1 | 0.4 |
| U/B Aristocrats | 1 | 0.4 |
| **Total:** | **226** | **100** |

To no one's surprise, Abzan and Dark Jeskai were the most popular deck choices, but what is astonishing is the large gap between the two. This may largely be due to the fact that so many friends of white-blue defected to Esper. If you add up the numbers for Esper Control and the similar Esper Dragons, you'll have an archetype whose popularity rivals that of the various Jeskai variants. Still, Abzan rules the format, even more so when you consider the many spin-offs like Blue Abzan, Red Abzan, Abzan Megamorph, and Abzan Tokens. Though one could argue that the last two have quite a lot in common with Bant Megamorph and Esper Tokens, respectively.


Talking of which, Esper Tokens is somewhat of a misnomer since the main deck usually contains no blue cards at all and the token theme is only represented through [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker), [Secure the Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secure+the+Wastes), [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar), and [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor). In fact, some people refer to the deck as White/Black Superfriends for the large number of planeswalkers.


Similar to Esper Control/Dragons and the various Abzan variants, looking at Atarka Red and R/G Landfall separately may give the impression that red aggro decks didn't do particularly well. But combine their numbers and things look quite different.


Actually, let's take a step back and take a look at the big picture:




| Deck | # | % |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Abzan | 86 | 38.1 |
| Jeskai | 27 | 11.9 |
| Esper Control | 27 | 11.9 |
| Red Aggro with Green | 23 | 10.2 |
| Rally the Ancestors | 13 | 5.8 |
| Eldrazi Ramp | 12 | 5.3 |
| Esper Tokens | 10 | 4.4 |
| Bant Megamorph | 7 | 3.1 |
| Jund Elves | 3 | 1.3 |
| Mardu | 3 | 1.3 |
| W/B Aggro | 3 | 1.3 |
| Temur Dragons | 3 | 1.3 |
| Bring to Light | 2 | 0.9 |
| Rest: | 7 | 3.1 |
| **Total:** | **226** | **100** |

Here you see all of the aforementioned decks collapsed into a few "macro archetypes." However, this only widens the gap between Abzan and all the rest â€¦
