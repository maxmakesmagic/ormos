Way back when, when *Mirage* flavor text was being written, the team was having trouble deciding what flavor text to put on [Ray of Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Command). They were stumped. The card was brought up at a meeting, and Bill Rose -- now the head of R&D -- blurted out, "Heel."

Simple, effective, hmmm… The team liked it; in fact, the shortness of it inspired them to continue making four-letter flavor text over the next few sets. [Ray of Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Command) was in *Mirage*, then two more four-letter flavor texts appeared in *Visions*, and then one each in *Weatherlight*, *Tempest*, *Stronghold*, and *Exodus*, culminating with one final hurrah in *Unglued*.

Can you name all of the four-letter flavor text cards? Answer below.
