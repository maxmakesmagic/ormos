After a long delay with the mechanics, “You Make The Card 2” has picked up speed. Last week we asked you to select a card concept. Here’s how the vote turned out:



|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Letter** | **Concept** | **Submitted by** | **Votes** | **%** |
| C | Hourglass | Hugo Carneiro | 1412 | 22.10% |
| D | Jewel | Kalev Tait | 1254 | 19.63% |
| J | Mechanical Tree | Alan Mills | 829 | 12.98% |
| E | Mirror | Nate Hannon | 751 | 11.76% |
| G | Plow | Dan Solow | 651 | 10.19% |
| A | Bag of Soil | Peter Bradshaw | 393 | 6.15% |
| F | Painting | Benjamin Wolf | 322 | 5.04% |
| I | Sundial | Remus Shepherd | 268 | 4.20% |
| B | Puzzle Globe | The\_HounDs | 261 | 4.09% |
| H | Floating Pyramid | Richie Procopio | 247 | 3.87% |
| **Total** |  |  | **6388** | **100.00%** |

So the winning concept is:  
**"An hourglass with a destroyed forest in the top chamber and a beautiful lush forest in the bottom chamber."**

This week we’re jumping right in and picking an artist. We consulted with **Magic**’s art director, Jeremy Cranford, to select ten appropriate artists who have agreed to participate. (Those of you that watched the first “You Make the Card” know that we ask a little extra of the chosen artist.)

Here are the ten artists with a little highlight of some of their **Magic** work (Aaron chose artifacts where possible to show you the artist’s take on them.)
