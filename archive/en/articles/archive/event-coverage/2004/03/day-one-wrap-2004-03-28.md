Day one of the Birmingham Grand Prix is over and Mattias Jorstedt, winner of Pro Tour Yokohama 2003, is currently top of the standings. He rode his red-white monstrosity that featured double [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) to a perfect 8-0 record. 3 other players also managed the same record with some fairly busted decks. Grand Prix mainstay Rene Kraft was helped along with a [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus) while local amateurs Richard Moore and Chester Cheng had [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) and Arc Slogger respectively to bolster their card pools. In the chasing pack are such familiar names on the GP circuit as Jose Barbero, Frank Karsten, Nicolai Herzog, Olivier Ruel and Kai Budde. It has also been a good tournament for the host nation. Rather than rolling over and dying as in past GP's UK players got down, scrapped and battled their way into day two. Clown Prince of English Magic is in a serious 9th position. Day two also includes a smattering of national team members past and present with David Grant and Michael Groves. Also in there is Jake Smith, one of the finalists from last year's team Pro Tour


Tune in tomorrow for the draft to see how the players fare at the draft tables!
