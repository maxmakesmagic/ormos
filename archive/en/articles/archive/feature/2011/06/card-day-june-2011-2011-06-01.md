Card of the Day - June, 2011
============================

By Wizards of the Coast











![Auramancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Auramancer)**[Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer)** – *Odyssey* common. One of the hard rules of **Magic** card naming—with a few exceptions—is that a card's name only contains a game term if it actually has something to do with that game element mechanically. That rule, of course, can only apply to game terms that existed at the time. Even though "Aura" is now an enchantment subtype, this little 'mancer can mance any kind of enchantment, Aura or no.
 ![166](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=166)**[Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=166)** – Alpha common. [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) has finally emerged as the [Core Set Survivor](/en/articles/archive/core-set-survivor-magic-2012-2011-05-25), but [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) has a heck of a bad beat story. Beloved enough to make the cut in the modern era despite a misleadingly plural name, the Elves has been in every core set but one: *Eighth Edition*, when it lost out to [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) as part of the "Selecting *Eighth Edition*" promotion here on the site.
 ![Archon of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Archon+of+Justice)**[Archon of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice)** – *Eventide* rare. In its original printing, [Archon of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice)'s rules text was eighteen words long. When it [returns in ***Magic** 2012*](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/144), the new "dies" terminology will have cut that length fully in half. If this rate of text loss continues—50% every three years—by 2020 the Archon will have only a single word in its text box.
 ![Mind Control](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mind+Control)**[Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control)** – ***Magic** 2011* uncommon. [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) was a reconcepting of [Persuasion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion), which in turn was a fairly costed version of the classic [Control Magic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic). So what kind of creature-stealing did ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) get you in the old days? [Treachery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery). Not only did you steal a creature, you got to untap your lands. Seems fair!
 ![Syphon Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Syphon+Flesh)**[Syphon Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syphon+Flesh)** – ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* uncommon. Thanks to ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* you can now [Syphon Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syphon+Flesh) as well as [Life](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life), [Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind), and [Soul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul). Also [Spells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spells) and, um, [Rhystics](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhystics).
 ![Magmatic Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Magmatic+Force)**[Magmatic Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magmatic+Force)** – ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* rare. [Magmatic Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magmatic+Force) and [Celestial Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Force) are a pair of cards from ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* that do things at the beginning of each upkeep. Could they be related somehow to [Verdant Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force)? Maybe!
 ![Tribute to the Wild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tribute+to+the+Wild)**[Tribute to the Wild](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribute+to+the+Wild)** – ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* uncommon. Although the maro-sorcerers [Multani](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Multani) and [Molimo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molimo) have appeared [in flavor text before](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&flavor=+%5Bmaro-sorcerer%5D+!%5Bmodruni%5D), this is the first appearance of Modruni, a hitherto-unknown maro-sorcerer.
 ![Riddlekeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Riddlekeeper)**[Riddlekeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlekeeper)** – ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* rare. [Riddlekeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlekeeper) is a homunculus, which is a fairly [rare creature type](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?type=+%5Bhomunculus%5D%7C%7Csubtype=+%5Bhomunculus%5D) in **Magic**. It looks an awful lot like it might be related to [Bonded Fetch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Fetch) from *Future Sight*, don't you think?
 ![Stranglehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stranglehold)**[Stranglehold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stranglehold)** – ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* rare. We don't have trivia for this card; we just wanted everyone to enjoy the flavor text: "*The correct answer to a barbarian's riddle is to choke on your cleverness and die.*"
 ![Bazaar Trader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bazaar+Trader)**[Bazaar Trader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+Trader)** – *Worldwake* rare. Wait a minute! That's not "trading" so much as it is "giving things away for free," right? What kind of crazy bazaar is this?
 ![Traitor's Clutch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Traitor%27s+Clutch)**[Traitor's Clutch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traitor%27s+Clutch)** – *Time Spiral* common. The *Time Spiral* card [Traitor's Clutch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traitor%27s+Clutch) has the power to turn any 0/1 into a pretty good simulation of The *Time Spiral* card [Nether Traitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Traitor). Some of the references in that block are just to the block itself! 
 ![Maga, Traitor to Mortals](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Maga%2C+Traitor+to+Mortals)**[Maga, Traitor to Mortals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maga%2C+Traitor+to+Mortals)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* rare. After the sack of Minamo, Maga took to wandering Takenuma while trying to learn more about oni. Eventually, as his name implies, he became more sympathetic to the spirits than to humans.
 ![Sedris, the Traitor King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sedris%2C+the+Traitor+King)**[Sedris, the Traitor King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedris%2C+the+Traitor+King)** – *Shards of Alara* mythic rare. Sedris was the last living ruler of Vithia, but sold his kingdom and his soul to the first demon lords. Now, he rules as a powerful lich over the land known as "Grixis"—Vithian for "Traitor".
 ![Glissa, the Traitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Glissa%2C+the+Traitor)**[Glissa, the Traitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa%2C+the+Traitor)** – *Mirrodin Besieged* mythic rare. Glissa was held in stasis by the Phyrexians until it was time to take over Mirrodin. When the Mirrodin-Phyrexia war began, Glissa returned to the Tangle to carry out the will of her dark masters.
 ![Commandeer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Commandeer)**[Commandeer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commandeer)** – *Coldsnap* rare. "Commandeer" would be a good name for a format where instead of a Legendary general, you can only choose from [Gang of Elk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gang+of+Elk), [Glimmerpoint Stag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpoint+Stag), and [Great Sable Stag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Sable+Stag).
 ![Zhou Yu, Chief Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zhou+Yu%2C+Chief+Commander)**[Zhou Yu, Chief Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zhou+Yu%2C+Chief+Commander)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* rare. Zhou Yu's restriction of only being able to attack islands is probably a reference to the [Battle of Red Cliffs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=10501), in which he commanded the forces that destroyed the naval fleet of [Cao Cao, Lord of Wei](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cao+Cao%2C+Lord+of+Wei).
 ![Commander Greven il-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Commander+Greven+il-Vec)**[Commander Greven *il*-Vec](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commander+Greven+il-Vec)** – *Tempest* rare. Greven was a main antagonist in the *Weatherlight* Saga. He's the captain of the [Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator). And he's literally the face of [Hatred](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hatred)!
 ![Cao Ren, Wei Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cao+Ren%2C+Wei+Commander)**[Cao Ren, Wei Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cao+Ren%2C+Wei+Commander)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* rare. Horsemanship is an ability that's been used only in *Portal Three Kingdoms* (and online *Masters Edition* sets that used cards from that set). It's essentially the same thing as flying, but since very few of the characters in the *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* had wings, it got a new flavor.
 ![Commander Eesha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Commander+Eesha)**[Commander Eesha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commander+Eesha)** – *Judgment* rare. According to the book *Judgment*, Eesha became the leader of the Order after [Major Teroh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Major+Teroh) died. Teroh succeeded [Lieutenant Kirtar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lieutenant+Kirtar). Before Kirtar, it was [Pianna, Nomad Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pianna%2C+Nomad+Captain), who was presumably the last non-Aven leader the Order had.
 ![Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blighted+Agent)**[Blighted Agent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent)** – *New Phyrexia* common. Now that the Phyrexians have won the war for Mirrodin, the factions are turning on each other. Judging by its flavor text, [Blighted Agent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent)'s unblockability is mostly used for spying on [Urabrask the Hidden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urabrask+the+Hidden)'s sealed furnace layer.
 ![War Report](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=War+Report)**[War Report](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Report)** – *New Phyrexia* common. It's been a long time since a block's plot played out entirely on cards. Back in the Weatherlight Saga, if something important happened (like Stark realizing that Volrath was possessing Takara), it was bound to be mentioned somewhere (like the flavor text of [Vendetta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=19589)). Some plot points still show up on cards, though. For example, [War Report](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Report)'s flavor text contains the actual end of the Mirran-Phyrexian War!
 ![Etched Monstrosity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Etched+Monstrosity)**[Etched Monstrosity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Monstrosity)** – *New Phyrexia* mythic rare. Although [Etched Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) has art and a name that call back to *Darksteel*'s [Etched Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Oracle), it's [Etched Monstrosity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Monstrosity) that has the reference to the sunburst mechanic.
