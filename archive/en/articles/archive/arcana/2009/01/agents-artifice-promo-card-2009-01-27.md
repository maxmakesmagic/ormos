In celebration of today's launch of the new planeswalker novel, *Agents of Artifice,* Wizards has created an alternate art Jace Beleren card. This promotional version of the card features the cover art from *Agents of Artifice* by renowned **Magic** artist Aleksi Briclot.

Here's how it works: Wizards has provided retailers who are running the *Conflux* pre-release tournament one card for every copy of the book they order\* to use as a gift with purchase in their stores. 

Give your local game store a call to see if they are participating, and get your hands on one of the cards!

### About Agents of Artifice


> 
> Of all the creatures in the multiverse, only the planeswalkers know of its limitless expanse. Only the planeswalkers have the spark that allows them to travel through the aether between worlds, that chaotic medium between the planes known as the Blind Eternities...
> 
> 
> Jace Beleren, a powerful sorcerer whose rare telepathic ability opens the doors many would prefer closed, is at a crossroads: The decisions he makes now will forever affect his path.
> 
> 
> Tezzeret, megalomaniacal leader of an interplanar cabal, marshals the powers of the multiverse for his own nefarious gain.
> 
> 
> Liliana Vess, a mercurial necromancer whose dark beauty belies secrets still darker, has designs neither can predict.
