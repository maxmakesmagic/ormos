### January 25-28: Prerelease Bonanza


This has been a good week for Prereleases in **Magic** history, with four Prereleases all falling between January 24 and January 30. If you gain access to a time machine, and that time machine turns out to have a faulty "year" display (as they so often seem to), feel free to print out this handy chart:


* January 24-25, 2004: *[Darksteel](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_darksteel_productinfo)* prerelease.
* January 25-26, 2003: *[Legions](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_legions_productinfo)* prerelease.
* January 26-27, 2002: *[Torment](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_torment_productinfo)* prerelease.
* January 27-28, 2001: *[Planeshift](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_planeshift_productinfo)* prerelease.

![Four prereleases!](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/activity/115_thumb.jpg)As a result, the last week of January has seen some crazy innovations in **Magic**. The three-color world of *Planeshift*, the black-tilted *Torment*, the all-creature *Legions*, and the introduction of indestructible in *Darksteel* have all shaken up **Magic**.


It seems almost too obvious to mention, but in case you were not aware of it, the *Conflux* Prerelease is taking place this very weekend, from January 31-February 1! Find an event near you or a larger Regional Prerelease by checking out [this handy list](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases)!
