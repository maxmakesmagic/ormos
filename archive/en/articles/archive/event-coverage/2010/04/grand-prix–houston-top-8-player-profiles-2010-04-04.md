**Age:** 28  
**Hometown:** Osaka  
**Occupation:** Professional Magic Player


**Magic Experience (PTs, Nats, GPs, etc):**  

 Went 3-3 and 2-3 the last two weeks...


**What deck are you playing and why did you choose it for this tournament?**   

 Hypergenesis -- I gave up on playing Zoo.


**What is your deck’s best matchup? Your worst?**  

 I don’t know but the worst is a 4 Chalice deck.


**Are there any cards you have seen officially spoiled in Rise of Eldrazi that you are excited to play with?**


15 mana Eldrazi!


**With Nationals season rapidly approaching, what player would you most like on your national team, besides yourself?**


Umesaki -- He played in World Championships and is a level 3 judge.  

 Kawasaki -- He is editor of mtg.jp.com the Japanese official site  

 It would make an 0-9 team (If I won a match...maybe lose two)

**Name:** Ken Ellis  
**Age:** 24  
**Hometown:** Stackton, CA  
**Occupation:** Miser


**Magic Experience (PTs, Nats, GPs, etc):**  

 I have qualified for two Pro Tours and scrubbed out and finished 22nd at GP SeaTac with 1 bye.


**What deck are you playing and why did you choose it for this tournament?**


UW Thoptimistic, my friend Nathan “Ponder” Ward and brewed it so I decided not to audible to Elves after Matt Nass talked me out of switching to Elves.


**What is your deck’s best matchup? Your worst?**


The best match up is random decks and Zoo. My worst are Zoo with Boom//Bust and Scapeshift since it is my only loss.


**Are there any cards you have seen officially spoiled in Rise of Eldrazi that you are excited to play with?**


All of the Eldrazi and the level-up Elf.


**With Nationals season rapidly approaching, what player would you most like on your national team, besides yourself?**


Todd Anderson scooped me in so him, LSV and Matt Nass or David Ochoa or Wraptor or any of my friends

**Name:** Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa  
**Age:** 22  
**Hometown:** Porto Alegre  
**Occupation:** Student/Magic player


**Magic Experience (PTs, Nats, GPs, etc):**  

 5 PT Top 8, 6 GP Top 8, 2 Nationals wins


**What deck are you playing and why did you choose it for this tournament?**  

 Scapeshift Combo because I was not confidant in my ability to win matches in time with Thopter Foundry, so I tried a couple of games with this and liked it.


**What is your deck’s best matchup? Your worst?**  

 I honestly have no idea; something like Living End is probably the best and perhaps Faeries is the worst?


**Are there any cards you have seen officially spoiled in Rise of Eldrazi that you are excited to play with?**  

 Not really, though I haven’t been paying much attention. I prefer waiting for the whole set or almost all of it to put things in context.


**With Nationals season rapidly approaching, what player would you most like on your national team, besides yourself?**  

 There are a lot of players I’d like to team with but if I have to pick one, I suppose Carlos Romao

 Pro Tour Austin / U.S. Nats 2008


**What deck are you playing and why did you choose it for this tournament?**  

 Blood Zoo, as Blood Moon can just randomly win games. Plus, Bloodbraid Elf is the nuts.


**What is your deck’s best matchup? Your worst?**  

 Going into Top 8 I was 4-1 against Thepths. Worst is probably Living End due to lack of playtesting, Dredge is an auto-loss too.

 15/15’s seem pretty hot!
