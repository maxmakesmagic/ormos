We've previewed a lot of great cards this week, one right after the other. So much so that we haven't had much time to stop and appreciate the art.


And the art in *Eldritch Moon* is on fleek, as the kids are saying these days. (It just means "on point." I don't understand the youth of today. And, yes, I know that makes me sound old.)


So let's take a moment and appreciate some of the amazing art on cards shown off this week. Click any image below to enlarge it.


Enjoy!
