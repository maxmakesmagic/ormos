While sadly no longer on course for Top 8, Mikael Magnusson has brought one of the most interesting decks we've seen all weekend: an almost creatureless blue-red counter-burn strategy.



 The most flashy aspect of the deck is clearly its ability to deal 8 damage in one strike with [Riddle of Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddle+of+Lightning) revealing [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) or [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise). "I had a great game yesterday, where I was at 1 life facing a massive army of creatures with my opponent at 22. At end of turn, I targeted him with [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet), put two cards on the bottom, cast another [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) and put another two cards on the bottom, then [Riddle of Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddle+of+Lightning), put three cards on the bottom, blind-flip [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), cast [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), had another [Riddle of Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddle+of+Lightning) for 8, and finally [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) for a total of 23 damage," Magnusson recounted excitedly. "He didn't expect that."
