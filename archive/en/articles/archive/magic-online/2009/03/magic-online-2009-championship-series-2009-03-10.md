### Events Eligibility




* All *Magic Online* players who meet the eligibility requirements set forth herein are eligible to compete in this online tournament series. All *Magic Online* players are eligible to compete in the 2009 *Magic Online* Championship Series except (a) players who are otherwise ineligible to engage in tournament play pursuant to the [*Magic Online* User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358) and (b) employees or contractors of Wizards of the Coast LLC, Hasbro or each of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or their advertising or promotion agencies, or those who are domiciled with any such person, or those who have been disqualified for other reasons (see below). This is a skill-based tournament based on a player's ability to defeat other players.




* Players will be disqualified if they are banned from the game for any reason, including without limitation a violation of the [*Magic Online* User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358).




* Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for a championship or championship event, players are not permitted to have more than 1 of their accounts entered in the event. Players are not permitted to have secondary accounts played by another person. If a player is discovered to have more than 1 account playing in a championship or championships before, during, or after the event, appropriate penalties will be applied (including disqualification from the event with no refund of product or event tickets).




* Playing on another person's account, selling your account, etc. are all violations of the [Terms of Service](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358). If you play in these championships, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are on your own account. We do not recognize "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that adult has purchased.




* Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to reschedule and/or restart games and matches as needed. Such decisions will be announced on [magicthegathering.com](http://www.magicthegathering.com).

To be eligible to participate in a month-end championship, the following requirements must be met:




* All Magic Online players must be at least 13 or older. A championship player between the ages of 13 and 18 will be required to get a parent or guardian's signature on the required waiver and consent forms as explained below. In addition, the player must have Internet access as well as access to a personal computer.




* Player must be a *Magic Online* account holder in good standing and in compliance with the [*Magic Online* User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358).

### Season Structure




* There are seven seasons in the 2009 *Magic Online* Championship series. Each season consists of a number of called out tournaments (queues, daily, and premier events) that will offer the opportunity to earn Qualifier points (QPs). Each season will end during the last weekly downtime prior to its championship. The actual start and end dates are in the schedule below.




* At the end of each specified tournament, all participants may earn qualifier points (QPs) based upon their final rank in the tournament.




* At the end of each season, all players who have earned sufficient QPs are invited to participate in the appropriate end-of-season championship.

### Connectivity




* Due to the nature of computers and the Internet, Wizards of the Coast is not responsible for the results of any disconnection or network problems experienced by players.

### Qualifier Points




* In addition to the normal prizes for specified tournaments, high finishing players earn qualifier points (QPs) based on the following schedule:  

	+ The winner of any 8-player queue (Constructed, Draft, or Sealed) earns 1 QP  
	
		- 8-player constructed queues will be added for appropriate seasons.
	+ Finishing in the top 8 of any scheduled Daily or Premier Event earn 3 QPs




* In addition different tournaments or formats may be called out and offer increased amounts of QPs each month. This QP schedule will be announced a minimum of 1 week prior to the start of a season.

### Season Championships

### Championship Structure




* Championships are open only to players who earned sufficient QPs in the current season.




* A season ends and each player's QPs are reset to zero during the last scheduled downtime before a season championship.




* All events that start after this downtime will offer QPs towards the next month's championship.

### Championships Participation




* A player must have earned at least **15 QPs** during the season to be eligible for the season championship.




* A list of all players that have qualified for a season ending championship will be maintained on the Wizards of the Coast web site. Players will be registered into that season's championship after the season has ended during the last scheduled downtime before the event. A list of all qualified players will also be posted online.




* It will be the player's responsibility to make sure that they have been properly entered into this event and are able to join it PRIOR to the start of the championship. If a player is qualified and is unable to join the championship, they will need to contact customer service to get this corrected.
