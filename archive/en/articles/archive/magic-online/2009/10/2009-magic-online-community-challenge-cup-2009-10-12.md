**Magic Online’s** vibrant and vocal community has always been willing to challenge the **MTGO** team. Now, it is the **MTGO** team’s turn to challenge the community. We are putting together a special fun-filled competition to celebrate this spirited relationship.

 For this inaugural event, we have invited a team of 8 players consisting of 4 members of the press and 4 **Magic Online** Community Leaders to be your representatives. These **Magic Online** fans will be flown out to **Wizards of the Coast’s** headquarters to compete against a team of **Wizards of the Coast** employees to see who will lay claim to the Community Challenge Cup. And to make it interesting, the community team won’t only be playing for themselves, but also for potential rewards for the community as a whole! There will be several opportunities to provide input, so make sure to participate and give the Community Team your advice and support!

DATES: November 5-6, 2009. 


LOCATION: Live event held at the **Wizards of the Coast** corporate office in Renton, WA USA 


FORMAT: Multiple events. Each format will consist of a hand-paired 4-round Swiss tournament (to ensure each match is a community vs. creator matchup). 


Thursday November 5 

* Zendikar Draft
* 100-Card Singleton Unified Constructed\*

Friday November 6 

* Standard Unified Constructed\*\*
* Invasion Block Draft

SCORING: Each of the four tournaments will award Championship Points based on the number of match wins as follows:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **# of match wins** | **Championship Points** |
| 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 10 |
| 3 | 17 |
| 4 | 25 |

The total Championship Points from all 4 events will be used to tabulate each player’s scores. Bonus Championship Points may be available through additional special events as well.


After each event, we will also tally each team’s player points to determine the team scores. The team that has the highest score at the end of the entire Community Challenge Cup wins!
