Regular readers of this site should already be familiar with Scot Wills who writes the Limited Information Column every Monday. Although down on draft table 9 with a mixture of players on 2-1 and 1-2 Scott's table is really tough. Seven of the eight players have previously played a pro tour with the remaining player, Gideon Moss having been a Wizards employee for 5 years thus limiting his chances of qualifying. The table reads

Pack 1 *Mirrodin*


![Altar of Shadows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Altar+of+Shadows)Scott's opening booster contained a choice of Bone Splitter, Sky Hunter Patrol, [Myr Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) or [Detonate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detonate) with Scott choosing the [Detonate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detonate). Scott second picked [Altar of Shadows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+Shadows) over [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter), [Barter in Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood) and Leonine Den Guard. This is a pretty controversial pick but Scott feels that Alter of Shadows just wins games and is therefore better than the more consistent [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter). Booster 3 gave Scott the choice of [Fabricate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate), [Thoughtcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast), [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) and [Fractured Loyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fractured+Loyalty), the often-undervalued [Fabricate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate) was his selection. After this he settled into drafting blue, red for the remainder of the booster collecting in order Aether Spell Bomb, Krark Clan Grunt (Over [Pewter Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) and [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog)), [Lumengrid Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Sentinel) and [Thoughtcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast) over [Nim Shrieker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker). He rounded off the remaining picks by getting a [Neurok Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Familiar), [Steel Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Wall) over [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr) and [Lumengrid Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Warden).


Pack 2 *Darksteel*


Scott's second, first pick contained Hoverguard observer, Barbed Lightening and [Pristine Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pristine+Angel), Scott may have been red, blue at this stage, but so what [Pristine Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pristine+Angel) really is that good. Engineer was his choice over [Spire Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem) and [Murderous Spoils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Spoils), then [Neurok Transmuter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Transmuter) over [Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) and [Chittering Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chittering+Rats). His next picks were [Spire Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem), [Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) and [Arcbound Bruiser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Bruiser) over another [Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) (his third bounce spell). In these last few boosters he had passed 3 [Grimclaw Bats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grimclaw+Bats) indicating that if he was drafting black, he would have had a very good deck, when I asked him about this afterwards he said "Once I had past the [Pewter Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) in the first booster I felt I had passed too much black to switch". The boosters were rounded off by an [Arcbound Hybrid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Hybrid) and an [Arcbound Worker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker). 


Pack 3 *Fifth Dawn*


Scott had a tough pick first booster again, This time [Loxodon Anchorite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Anchorite) was his choice over Cranial Plate, He then had little choice for 2 Squires and a [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) finally he finished with 2 [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) and Sun Touched Myr.


Scott's deck isn't amazing but also isn't bad he is going to struggle against a likely amazing black deck and expects a 2-1 record with the deck. [Pristine Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pristine+Angel) is arguably the best card in the format and his two [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) should help him here in a big way.
