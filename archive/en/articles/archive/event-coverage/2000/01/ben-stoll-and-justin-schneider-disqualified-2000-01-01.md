Justin Schneider and Ben Stoll were disqualified in Grand Prix Detroit after Schneider offered Stoll a bribe to concede to him in round 14, Head Judge Mike Donais said.


Stoll had already clinched a berth in the Top 8 and had basically nothing to gain from win; Schneider needed to win his last match in order to advance to his second Grand Prix Top 8 of the qualifier season and he really wanted to continue his comeback to Magic prominence after several years away from the game.


As they sat down to play their feature match, Justin whispered under his breath "I'll give you whatever." Stoll said "ok" and Stoll then proceeded to throw the match. All the spectators agreed that he played extremely badly (even mulliganing away an opening draw of Crosis's Charm, Exotic Curse, and assorted land). After Stoll's many misplays, capped by a bizarre block that cost him an apparently unlosable game 2, Justin celebrated his Top 8 slot and then suggested they go play some "fun games" against each other. They disappeared from the tournament site completely and agreed that Justin would give Ben half of whatever he won this weekend.


When Head Judge Mike Donais was finally able to find them again, he separately questioned each of them at length and eventually disqualified both of them from the tournament (without prize) for collusion. While it is legal to concede a match at any point, it is very illegal to do so in exchange for any sort of compensation.


Their disqualification resulted in Matt Vienneau and Dan Clegg, who thought they were going to finish 9th and 10th, moving up to 7th and 8th and getting to draft one more time. Vienneau ended up winning the tournament.
