Welcome to our latest look at the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings. We're into a quiet period, with no major points-scoring events scheduled, and that means our Top 25 remains unchanged from last week. Jérémy Dezani of France continues to set the pace, with the US claiming five of the next six spots and Israel's reigning [World Champion](/en/events/coverage/woc13), Shahar Shenhar, separating them at No. 6. The Asia-Pacific region rounds out the Top 10, with former Players of the Year Yuuya Watanabe and Shuhei Nakamura at No. 8 and No. 9, while Hong Kong's Lee Shi Tian continues to demonstrate he's among the world's best. 

 Defending Player of the Year Josh Utter-Leyton sits at No. 11, ahead of the Canadian pair of Alexander Hayne and [Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*](/en/events/coverage/ptbngs14) finalist Jacob Wilson. From there, it's a real scrum, with a mere 7 points covering Stanislav Cifka at No. 14 all the way down to his Czech compatriot Martin Juza at No. 25. 

 Ahead, Pros will face an interesting choice—whether to go in search of points at Grand Prix in Warsaw or Minneapolis, or instead to focus with their testing teams for Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* a week later. First, though, a much easier choice to make, one that most of you will likely be making later this week—how many Prerelease tournaments can you cram into one weekend? Wherever you're beginning your exploration of *Journey into Nyx*, have fun, and we'll see you again here at the home of the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings next week.
