For Tamiyo, every plane holds a mystery that sets it apart from all others. Tamiyo travelled to Innistrad to explore the mystery of the silver moon. Tamiyo has been observing Innistrad for many cycles, using her powers as a planeswalker to gain insight into the force it exerts on the world. She has watched with rapt attention the moon's effect on the lycanthropic curse, and she has written extensive notes on the ebb and flow of vampire frenzies in relation to the moon's influence. Her curiosity eventually led her to the door of the famed astronomancer Jenrik. Tamiyo spent months in his moonstone tower poring over countless charts, adding her own observations to his collection about the odd power the moon holds over the denizens and populace of the plane.
