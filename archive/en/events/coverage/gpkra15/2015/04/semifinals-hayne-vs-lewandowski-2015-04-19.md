Bartłomie Lewandowski, the 26 year old from Warsaw, Poland, and his Jeskai Token deck had just beat Blue/Black Control in the quarterfinals and were now up against a similar deck again: Esper Dragons piloted by Alexander Hayne. The Canadian was the same age but, whereas this was Lewandowski's first Top 8, Hayne could look back on six previous Grand Prix Top 8s including three wins. Obviously, he wanted to make this, his seventh, another victory.

**The Games**


Lewandowski had [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) on turn two and managed to get some points of damage in, but his draw didn't allow for much more. He was holding two [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise)s and one [Secure the Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secure+the+Wastes) as his only spells and kept drawing land after land.



[Secure the Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secure+the+Wastes) met [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke), [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) met [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve), and it wasn't long before Lewandowski was introduced to Mr. [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death): Silumgar, meet Bartłomie; Bartłomie, meet … your doom.



Naturally, the 1/1 tokens on Lewandowski's side abandoned the ship quickly and Hayne's [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) sealed the deal.


**Alexander Hayne 1-0 Bartłomie Lewandowski**

Lewandowski boarded a couple of counterspells, [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) and [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke), but this only meant he would now be trying to beat Hayne's deck at its own game. This time, Lewandowski got even less of an offense going. By about turn seven, Hayne was sitting very comfortably at 22 life with five cards in hand.



Lewandowski put up a fight, managed to get Hayne all the way down to, well 10, but then [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death) and [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) took control of the game and didn't let go.



**Alexander Hayne 2-0 Bartłomie Lewandowski**
