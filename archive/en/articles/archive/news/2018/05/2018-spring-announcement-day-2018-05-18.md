Everything has been building up to this.


Nicol Bolas's plans are taking shape, and heroes are converging on Ravnica to stop him—which means we're going back to the world of guilds as well!


We'll be spending three sets on Ravnica as we gear up for the final showdown with Bolas himself. We've got a little way to go till we get there, but now you can start preparing yourself—dig out that Izzet shirt, tune up that Golgari Commander deck, stack up your Orzhov tokens (or gold), and get ready to go back to Ravnica!


* [*Guilds of Ravnica*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/coming-soon#GRN) releases October 5, 2018, and will prominently feature the harmonious Selesnya (green-white), the militant Boros (red-white), the life-and-death-focused Golgari (black-green), the frazzled geniuses of the Izzet (blue-red), and the mystery of the Dimir (blue-black).
* [*Ravnica Allegiance*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/coming-soon#RNA) ratchets up the drama and releases January 2019, and will complete our travels through the guilds. Join the orderly Azorius (white-blue), the chaotic Rakdos (black-red), the wild Gruul (red-green), the experimental Simic (green-blue), and the devious Orzhov (white-black) as we reach the penultimate moment of the Gatewatch's story.
* It wouldn't be a return to Ravnica without letting players play as their favorite guilds. Guild Kits will feature a 60-card deck flavored after your favorite guild, plus guild schwag like pins, stickers, and Spindown life counters. Play as any one of the *Guilds of Ravnica* guilds with the *Guilds of Ravnica* Guild Kits releasing on November 2, 2018. *Ravnica Allegiance* Guild Kits release February 2019.

And, as you might have noticed in the video, we're spending a third set on Ravnica as well—but we're not quite ready to talk about it yet. Just know that while the setting will be Ravnica, the focus will be on the culmination of the story and not the guilds.


It's going to be a wild ride as we return to one of *Magic*'s favorite planes, and the long-boiling war with Nicol Bolas reaches its crescendo.
