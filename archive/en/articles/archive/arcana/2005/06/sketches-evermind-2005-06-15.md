Welcome to another edition of [Sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches:)! Today we take a look behind the scenes of the creation of that uncastable instant from *Saviors of Kamigawa*, **[Evermind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evermind)**. But first, some background on the artist, Matt Thompson.


[Savage Beating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Savage%2BBeating)
### Artist Portfolio


 Artist [Matt Thompson](http://gatherer.wizards.com/?first=1&last=100&term=matt+thompson&Field_Artist=on&setfilter=Allsets&colorfilter=All&typefilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&printingfilter=on&x=39&y=26) has contributed over twenty pieces of **Magic** card art since 2001's *Onslaught* set. You can see his work on such cards as [Root Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Root+Sliver), [Final Punishment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Punishment), [Consume Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit), [Serum Powder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Powder), [Curse of the Fire Penguin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+the+Fire+Penguin), [Uncontrollable Anger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uncontrollable+Anger), and [Kataki, War's Wage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kataki%2C+War%27s+Wage), among many others. 


### Art Description


The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions given to Matt for [Evermind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evermind):



> *Color: Blue  
>  Location: Your choice  
>  Action: This spell represents spirit-world magical spell that enables you to learn one thing "automatically" while doing another. How to represent this is up to you. For example, you could show a blue-aligned female jushi (wizard) sleeping while a weird little blue kami of your design floats above her, as though studying her. Come up with something that you think makes the most interesting/cool image.  
>  Focus: The magical learning  
>  Mood: It pays to be observant.  
>  Notes: It could be abstact if that direction works better.*

(Keep in mind that "Notes" field!) The next step is for the artist to submit sketches of his or her vision of the art description.


### Sketches


Here are Matt's concept sketches submitted for [Evermind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evermind):

*[Evermind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evermind) sketch 1 by Matt Thompson*  



![Evermind sketch 2](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/evermind_sketch2.jpg)  
*[Evermind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evermind) sketch 2 by Matt Thompson*  



![Evermind sketch 3](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/evermind_sketch3.jpg)  
*[Evermind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evermind) sketch 3 by Matt Thompson*  



[Evermind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evermind) is a very abstract spell -- it isn't castable, only spliceable to get its effect. As you can see, Matt went a very abstract direction with his sketches. 


The art team had a wealth of good ideas to choose from here; they liked both the first and third sketch (but check out the hand lifting off the jushi's *hair* in number two!). The first sketch followed closely to the suggestion in the art description, but in the end the art team favored the alien, floating eye-hands in number three. 


### Final Art


Matt submitted this final art.

An interesting addition here in the final art is the blindfold over the jushi's eyes -- an indication of the mage's "automatic" (i.e., non-spellcasting) learning.


### Finished Card


And here's the card in its final state, as you can see in booster packs of *Saviors of Kamigawa*. Draw some cards with uncastable spells (and a little help from Matt Thompson) with [Evermind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evermind)!
