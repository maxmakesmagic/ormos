### What is Oracle?


Magic is a game made up of more than 14,000 interchangeable pieces—the cards. Over the years, we've felt the need to update the wordings of older cards, whether because we've introduced a new keyword, or a card was printed with a mistake, or we have a clearer wording for what a card does, etc. Rather than sneak into your room at night and change your cards with a magic marker, we keep a database of the "modern wordings" (what the cards would say if we printed them today) of every tournament-legal card ever printed. These wordings are considered the official wordings of the cards, and accurately reflect their functions.


You can access a card's Oracle wording by looking it up in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx).


There are four cards affected, but it's really only one change. Seriously.


Oracle Change
=============



Better.



Four older cards referred to a creature or a creature card "with morph." Megamorph is a variant of the morph ability, so these four cards should respect that. So "morph" becomes "a morph ability" on [Backslide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Backslide), [Dermoplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dermoplasm), [Master of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Veil), and [Weaver of Lies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weaver+of+Lies). For example:



**Backslide**



*Old wording:*



Turn target creature with morph face down.


Cycling U *(U, Discard this card: Draw a card.)*



*New wording:*



Turn target creature with a morph ability face down.


Cycling U *(U, Discard this card: Draw a card.)*
