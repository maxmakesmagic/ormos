It's the second Monday of previews, and that means it's time for us to look deeply into the gorgeous basic land art that we have in store this time around.


However, this being Zendikar, and Zendikar meaning full-art lands, I know you're all anticipating this installment a little bit more eagerly than most. And rightfully so, as the lands are—well, I'll let some of the art speak for itself.

Island | Art by Tianhua X


It takes a lot to displace the bowl Island as my favorite piece of land art, but this masterful vista might do just that. And speaking of the bowl Island. . .

That isn't a tease or a callback—that is actual art you can find in *Battle for Zendikar* packs. One of the cool things the art team did this time around was keep five of the pieces of art from the original *Zendikar* full-art lands and reuse them among the new pieces, one for each basic land type. Here are those five.

But what about the new-art lands? Well, those look a little something like this:

I don't know about you, but I'm excited for another generation of full-art lands, and these certainly live up to the originals. You'll be able to get these, as well as fourteen other cards that, ya know, do things, when *Battle for Zendikar* releases on October 2.
