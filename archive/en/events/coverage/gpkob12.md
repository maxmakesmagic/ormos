Grand Prix Kobe 2012
--------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpkob12/trophy.jpg)Carried to victory on the back of some often overlooked cards, Masahiro Hiraga is the Grand Prix Kobe 2012 champion! Overlooked has been the theme of the weekend as we followed the paths of some of Japan's less recognized names on their paths to the Top 8. Standing in their way were some of the pillars of Japanese **Magic.** Hiraga had to sneak past former Player and Rookie of the Year Yuuya Watanabe on one side of the bracket using his nearly monowhite Humans deck. On the other side, with an impossibly fast black/white deck armed with a host of token generators and an aggressive supporting cast, Ken Yukuhiro cut through the Top 8 with a razor's edge. Even Katsuhiro Mori, who had managed a perfect 15-0 on the way to Top 8 failed to slow his meteoric rise. When the two met in the finals, the future of Japanese **Magic**, sparks flew. It took to game three, and some timely draws, but Hiraga was able to slow down the blazing Yukuhiro long enough to waltz past his army, which suffered a [Sudden Disappearance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Disappearance).


In a format previously defined by white cards, it was refreshing to see the emergence of red/green Werewolves as a major contender in *Dark Ascension* Draft, borne by the likes of Yuuya Watanabe and Finalist Ken Yukuhiro on their way to the Top 8. Just as the Werewolves emerged here in Kobe, many often overlooked Japanese talents emerged as well. Considering that most of the American and European players decided to go to Grand Prix Lincoln instead of coming to Kobe, this served as a perfect opportunity to really showcase some of the finer talents Japan has to offer. In addition to Hiraga and Yukuhiro, Hiroaki Kitahara and Takayuki Nagaoka, two other excellent talents, managed to draw some attention to themselves on the Sunday stage.


Two suns have risen and two suns have fallen as Grand Prix Kobe 2012 played on against the backdrop. As the sun set on the last day, one star could be seen shining in the clear night sky, and it won't be the last time either. Get ready, world. Grand Prix Kobe 2012 Champion Masahiro Hiraga has arrived!
