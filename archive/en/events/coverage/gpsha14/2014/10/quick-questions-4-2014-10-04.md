 Which clan do you like to draft the most?

***Han Bing:** Mardu. I love the raid mechanic and it allows me to build the best tempo-based deck.*

***Shouta Yasooka:** Sultai or five-color control. Delve is very powerful.*

***Zhang Mengqiu:** Abzan. Outlast is a very good mechanic and cards like [Abzan Falconer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Falconer) can dominate the board.*

***Albertus Law:** Raid is easy to trigger and many of the Raid cards are very solid on its own.*

***Yuuki Ichikawa:** Sultai. Talgam's Scheming and [Scout the Borders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scout+the+Borders) make the deck broken.*

***Ryan Young:** Abzan or Sultai. I like to start off by drafting black and green cards then decide my third color later.*
