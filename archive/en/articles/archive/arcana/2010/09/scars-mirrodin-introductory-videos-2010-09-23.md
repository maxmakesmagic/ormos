If you don't know by now that *Scars of Mirrodin* is having its prerelease this weekend, we haven't done our job. Although at this point, you'd have to have flagrantly skipped the first sentence of this paragraph, so it's at least partly your own fault.

But let's say you don't feel entirely ready for the prerelease. Well, there's some preparation you could do. For example, Tim Willoughby wrote a helpful [Prerelease Primer](/en/articles/archive/scars-mirrodin-prerelease-primer-2010-09-20) to tell you what you can expect at a prerelease. And the [*Scars of Mirrodin* product site](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/Products.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/products/scarsofmirrodin) includes a complete [Visual Spoiler](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/scarsofmirrodin/spoiler) of the set.

But what if you just want to learn about the new mechanics in the set? Well, we've got [an article about that](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/scarsofmirrodin/mechanics), too.

What's that? Reading's not your bag? You prefer to get your information via helpful video presentations? Well, good news!
