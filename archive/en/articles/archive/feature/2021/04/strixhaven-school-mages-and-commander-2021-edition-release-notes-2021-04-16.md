The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. Go to [Magic.Wizards.com/Rules](http://magic.wizards.com/rules) to find the most up-to-date rules.


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" sections contain answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" sections include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

GENERAL NOTES
=============


Release Information
-------------------


The *Strixhaven* set becomes legal for sanctioned Constructed play on its official release date, Friday, April 23, 2021. At that time, the following card sets will be permitted in the Standard format: *Throne of Eldraine*, *Theros Beyond Death*, *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths*, *Core Set 2021*, *Zendikar Rising*, *Kaldheim*, and *Strixhaven: School of Mages*.


Cards found in *Strixhaven* Draft Boosters and Theme Boosters will be included in the Standard format. These cards are numbered 1–275 and have printed set code STX.


There are 63 cards (with printed set code STA and collector numbers 1–63) in the Mystical Archive supplementary set. These cards are legal for play in any format that already allows those cards. For more information, see "Mystical Archive," below.


There are 81 new cards printed in the *Strixhaven* Commander Decks. These cards are legal for play in the Commander, Vintage, and Legacy formats. They aren't legal for play in the Standard, Pioneer, or Modern formats. These cards are numbered 1–81 and have printed set code C21. The other cards in these decks are legal for play in any format that already allows those cards; that is, appearing in these decks doesn't change a card's legality in any format. Those returning cards are numbered 82–327 and have printed set code C21.


Go to [Magic.Wizards.com/Formats](http://magic.wizards.com/formats) for a complete list of formats and their permitted card sets and banned lists.


Go to [Magic.Wizards.com/Commander](http://magic.wizards.com/Commander) for more information on the Commander variant.


Go to [Locator.Wizards.com](http://locator.wizards.com/) to find an event or store near you.

Mystical Archive
----------------


The lecture halls and libraries of Strixhaven are filled with knowledge both new and ancient. The most sought-after knowledge lies in the Mystical Archive, a history of some of the most powerful magic from throughout the Multiverse. You too can become a student of Strixhaven's most precious knowledge with the Mystical Archive supplementary set.


* There are 63 cards (with printed set code STA and collector numbers 1–63) in the Mystical Archive supplementary set. They will appear in Draft, Set, and Theme Boosters.
* *Strixhaven* Mystical Archive cards appearing in Draft Booster packs are playable in any Limited event using those packs. In a Sealed Deck tournament, those cards are part of your card pool. In a Booster Draft tournament, you must draft those cards for them to be included in your card pool.
* Mystical Archive cards are legal for play in any format in which they were already legal. That is, appearing in the Mystical Archive doesn't change what formats any card may be played in. Some, but not all, of the cards can also be found in sets that are currently legal in the Standard format. While nearly all Mystical Archive cards are reprints, one card (Abundant Harvest) is appearing for the first time. That card is legal for play in the Commander, Vintage, and Legacy formats.

New Ability Word: Magecraft
---------------------------


Not much point attending the most prestigious magical academy in existence if you're not going to be mastering sorcery. And instants, for that matter. Magecraft is a new ability word that highlights abilities that reward you for casting or copying instant and sorcery spells.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Archmage+Emeritus)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archmage+Emeritus)
Archmage Emeritus  

{2}{U}{U}  

Creature — Human Wizard  

2/2  
*Magecraft* — Whenever you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell, draw a card.


* Each magecraft ability has a different effect, although they all have the same trigger condition, whenever you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell.
* For example, if you control Archmage Emeritus and cast an instant or sorcery spell, Archmage Emeritus's magecraft ability will trigger and you will draw a card.
* If an effect creates a copy of an instant or sorcery spell, this will also cause the magecraft ability to trigger.
* If an effect creates multiple copies of an instant or sorcery spell, magecraft abilities trigger once for each copy created by the effect.
* Some effects instruct you to copy an instant or sorcery card in a zone other than the stack. These copies do not cause magecraft abilities to trigger. However, most effects that do this also allow you to cast the copy, and casting the copy will cause magecraft abilities to trigger.



---

New Keyword Ability: Ward
-------------------------


Just as important as your classes in casting deadly spells will be your classes in avoiding the very same spells when they are aimed at your creatures. To that end, Strixhaven introduces us to the ward mechanic. Ward is a keyword ability that protects your creatures by countering your opponents' spells and abilities that target them unless they pay a cost.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Waterfall+Aerialist)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waterfall+Aerialist)
Waterfall Aerialist  

{3}{U}  

Creature — Djinn Wizard  

3/1  

Flying  

Ward {2} *(Whenever this creature becomes the target of a spell or ability an opponent controls, counter it unless that player pays {2}.)*


The official rules for ward are as follows:


702.21. Ward


702.21a. Ward is a triggered ability. "Ward [cost]" means "Whenever this permanent becomes the target of a spell or ability an opponent controls, counter that spell or ability unless that player pays [cost]."


* If a player casts a spell that targets multiple permanents their opponent controls with ward, each of those ward abilities will trigger. If that player doesn't pay for all of them, the spell will be countered.
* Ward is an evergreen ability and will appear in future sets.



---

New Keyword Action: Learn
-------------------------


New Subtype: Lesson
-------------------


We're learning a lot of lessons already! Learn is a keyword action that lets you either discard a card and draw a card or put a Lesson card from outside the game into your hand.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Study+Break)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Study+Break)
Study Break  

{1}{W}  

Instant  

Tap up to two target creatures.  

Learn. *(You may reveal a Lesson card you own from outside the game and put it into your hand, or discard a card to draw a card.)*


The official rules for learn are as follows:


701.45. Learn


701.45a. "Learn" means "You may discard a card. If you do, draw a card. If you didn't discard a card, you may reveal a Lesson card you own from outside the game and put it into your hand."


* If a card is brought into the game from outside the game, it will stay in the game until it ends or until its owner leaves the game, whichever comes first.
* If you bring a card into the game from outside the game in a Constructed tournament (or a Constructed game played under tournament conditions), you may select only a card from your sideboard. In casual Constructed games, the card comes from your collection.
* If you bring a card into the game from outside the game in a Sealed Deck or Booster Draft event, you may select only a card that is in the card pool that you built your deck from.
* The official Commander rules don't include sideboards, but if you're using them anyway or casually allowing players to get cards from their collections, cards you bring into the game from outside the game can't share a name with any card in your starting deck.
* If instructed to learn, you may do nothing. Discarding a card and putting a Lesson card into your hand are both optional.
* Lesson is a new spell subtype found on some instant and sorcery cards in this set. The Lesson subtype has no special rules associated with it.
* Although you may want to include Lessons in your sideboard if you're playing with cards that instruct you learn, Lesson cards can be included in your main deck like other instant or sorcery cards.



---

New Keyword Ability: Demonstrate
--------------------------------


It's time to put our hard-won knowledge to use and teach others at the same time. Demonstrate is a keyword ability found on five cards in the *Strixhaven* Commander products. Cards with demonstrate let you copy the spell when you cast it, but also let an opponent copy that spell.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Excavation+Technique)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Excavation+Technique)
Excavation Technique  

{3}{W}  

Sorcery  

Demonstrate *(When you cast this spell, you may copy it. If you do, choose an opponent to also copy it. Players may choose new targets for their copies.)*  

Destroy target nonland permanent. Its controller creates two Treasure tokens.


Here are the official rules for the demonstrate ability:


702.143. Demonstrate


702.143a. Demonstrate is a triggered ability. "Demonstrate" means "When you cast this spell, you may copy it and you may choose new targets for the copy. If you copy the spell, choose an opponent. That player copies the spell and may choose new targets for the copy."


* You choose whether to make a copy as the demonstrate ability resolves. This happens before the original spell resolves. Your copy goes on the stack above the original spell.
* If you copy a spell with demonstrate, you then immediately choose an opponent. If they copy the spell, it goes on top of the stack.
* If the spell requires targets, you choose the target of the original spell as you cast it. If you create a copy of the spell, you may choose new targets for the copy as you create that copy. Similarly, the opponent you chose to create a copy may choose new targets for that copy as it's created. In other words, your opponent will know the targets of your original spell and your copy when choosing the new targets, if any, for their copy.
* This means that if you cast a spell with demonstrate and both you and an opponent copy it, the opponent's copy will resolve first, then your copy will resolve, and finally the original spell will resolve.
* If you cast the spell and choose not to copy it, no opponent will get to copy it either.



---

Cycle: "Mastery" Spells
-----------------------


Now that we've studied and learned and demonstrated our knowledge, we can achieve true Mastery! Specifically, the cycle of spells in the Strixhaven main set with "Mastery" in the name. These spells let you pay a cheaper alternative cost for a spell, but give an opponent an advantage if you do.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Baleful+Mastery)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Mastery)
Baleful Mastery  

{3}{B}  

Instant  

You may pay {1}{B} rather than pay this spell's mana cost.  

If the {1}{B} cost was paid, an opponent draws a card.  

Exile target creature or planeswalker.


* The mana value (previously converted mana cost; see "Mana Value," below) of a spell on the stack is determined by its mana cost, not any alternative costs you used to pay for it. For example, Baleful Mastery's mana value is always 4.
* If you choose to pay one alternative cost, you can't pay any other alternative costs. For example, if an effect lets you cast a "Mastery" spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't also choose to pay its given alternative cost.
* If an effect increases or decreases the cost of spells you cast, that cost increase or decrease is applied to the alternative cost you chose to pay. In that case, the cost was still paid for the purposes of the effect, even if you paid more or less for it when it was cast.
* If you copy a "Mastery" spell and the alternative cost was paid, the copy will resolve as though the cost was paid.
* In a multiplayer game, you choose which opponent takes the prescribed action as the spell resolves.



---

Cycle: "Snarl" Dual Lands
-------------------------


*Strixhaven* completes the cycle of versatile dual lands introduced in *Shadows over Innistrad*. Each one can tap for one of two colors of mana and may enter the battlefield untapped, depending on what other land cards you have in your hand.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Frostboil+Snarl)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostboil+Snarl)
Frostboil Snarl  

Land  

As Frostboil Snarl enters the battlefield, you may reveal an Island or Mountain card from your hand. If you don't, Frostboil Snarl enters the battlefield tapped.  

{T}: Add {U} or {R}.


* You may reveal any land card with either or both of the appropriate subtypes. It doesn't have to be a basic land card. For example, you could reveal Volatile Fjord from the *Kaldheim* set to satisfy the ability of Frostboil Snarl.
* The "Snarl" itself doesn't have any land subtypes. You can't reveal one to satisfy the ability of another.
* If a land card with an appropriate subtype is entering the battlefield from your hand at the same time as one of these lands, you may reveal the other land to have the "Snarl" enter untapped.
* If an effect instructs you to put one of these lands onto the battlefield tapped, it will still enter the battlefield tapped even if you reveal a land card from your hand.



---

New Term: Mana Value
--------------------


*Strixhaven* introduces the new rules term *mana value*. On cards and rules, wherever you previously would have seen "converted mana cost," you'll now see "mana value." They have the same definition. We're retiring the older term in favor of a shorter and hopefully more approachable alternative.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pillardrop+Rescuer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillardrop+Rescuer)
Pillardrop Rescuer  

{4}{W}  

Creature — Spirit Cleric  

2/2  

Flying  

When Pillardrop Rescuer enters the battlefield, return target creature card with mana value 3 or less from your graveyard to your hand.


* Mana value is the amount of mana found in a card's mana cost, disregarding color. For example, a card with mana cost {5}{R}{R} has mana value 7.
* If a card has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0 when determining the card's mana value, unless it is a spell on the stack. In that case, X has the value that was chosen for it as the spell was cast.



---

Returning Mechanic: Modal Double-Faced Cards
--------------------------------------------


Modal double-faced cards were introduced in the *Zendikar Rising* set, returned in *Kaldheim*, and are back once again, with the requisite new surprises in store. Modal double-faced cards give you great flexibility, letting you play either face depending on the situation. Previous sets included modal double-faced cards which only had permanent faces. Some modal double-faced cards in *Strixhaven* have an instant or sorcery on their back face.





![Blex, Vexing Pest](https://media.wizards.com/2021/stx/en_czsHMkZ0vS.png)
![Search for Blex](https://media.wizards.com/2021/stx/en_nLBrpCkI2x.png)

Turn Over


Blex, Vexing Pest  

{2}{G}  

Legendary Creature — Pest  

3/2  

Other Pests, Bats, Insects, Snakes, and Spiders you control get +1/+1.  

When Blex, Vexing Pest dies, you gain 4 life.  

/////  

Search for Blex  

{2}{B}{B}  

Sorcery  

Look at the top five cards of your library. You may put any number of them into your hand and the rest into your graveyard. You lose 3 life for each card you put into your hand this way.


### Playing with Modal Double-Faced Cards


* To determine whether it is legal to play a modal double-faced card, consider only the characteristics of the face you're playing and ignore the other face's characteristics. For example, if an effect stops you from casting creature spells, you can't cast Blex, Vexing Pest, but you can still cast Search for Blex.
* If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
* If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect. For example, if an effect allows you to cast sorcery spells from your graveyard, you can cast Search for Blex but not Blex, Vexing Pest. (Fear not, Blex. Your time will come.)
* If an effect allows you to put a card with particular characteristics onto the battlefield without instructing you to play or cast it, you consider only the characteristics of a modal double-faced card's front face to see if that card qualifies. If it does, it enters the battlefield with its front face up. For example, if an effect allows you to put a creature card from your graveyard onto the battlefield, you can put Blex, Vexing Pest onto the battlefield. (Rejoice, Blex.) However, an effect that lets you return a sorcery card from your graveyard to your hand won't let you return Search for Blex to your hand, as that card has only its front face's characteristics while in the graveyard.
* The mana value of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack or the battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the mana value of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
* A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.

### General Information on Double-Faced Cards


* Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the stack or battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored.
* While a double-faced card isn't on the stack or battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face. For example, the above card has only the characteristics of Blex, Vexing Pest in the graveyard, even if it was cast as Search for Blex before going to the graveyard.
* If an effect puts a double-faced card onto the battlefield, and its front face can't be put onto the battlefield, it doesn't enter the battlefield. For example, if an effect exiles a modal double-faced card whose front face is an instant and returns it to the battlefield, it remains in exile because an instant can't be put onto the battlefield. (*Strixhaven* doesn't have any modal double-faced cards whose front faces are instants or sorceries.)
* If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the name of either face may be chosen. If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.
* In the Commander variant, a double-faced card's color identity is determined by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of both faces combined. If either face has a color indicator or basic land type, those are also considered.
* One or both faces of a double-faced card may include a reminder about what's on the other face. This reminder text has no effect on gameplay.
* Each double-faced card has an icon in the top-left corner of each face. For modal double-faced cards in this set, these icons are a single black triangle for the front face, and a double white triangle for the back face.

### Using Substitute Cards


* It's important that the cards in your deck be indistinguishable from one another. To help you accomplish this with double-faced cards, you can use the substitute cards found in some *Strixhaven* booster packs. A substitute card can stand in for a double-faced card in hidden zones or wherever its identity is concealed (such as in exile if it's exiled face down). Using substitute cards is optional, but in tournaments, players with double-faced cards must use either substitute cards or opaque card sleeves (or both).
* You must have the actual double-faced card that each substitute card is representing with you. The double-faced card should be kept apart from the rest of the deck and your sideboard.
* A substitute card can be included in a deck only when it's being used to represent a double-faced card.
* You must write clearly on the substitute card to show which double-faced card it represents. The name of at least one face must be written on the substitute card, and any other information visible on either face of the card may also be written. Information that isn't available on the card may not be written on a substitute card.
* During the game, a substitute card is considered to be the double-faced card it represents.
* If a substitute card enters a public zone (the battlefield, the graveyard, the stack, or exile unless it's exiled face down), use the actual double-faced card and set the substitute card aside. If the double-faced card is put into a hidden zone (your hand or library), use the substitute card again.
* If a double-faced card is exiled face down or put onto the battlefield face down, keep its identity hidden by using the face-down substitute card or opaque card sleeves (or both).
* In some older sets, the substitute cards were checklists that listed double-faced cards or meld cards from those sets. A *Strixhaven* substitute card can be used to represent those double-faced cards. The same rules about what information may be written on substitute cards apply.

Academic Dispute  

{R}  

Instant  

Target creature blocks this turn if able. You may have it gain reach until end of turn.  

Learn. *(You may reveal a Lesson card you own from outside the game and put it into your hand, or discard a card to draw a card.)*


* The creature blocks only if it's able to do so as the declare blockers step begins. If, at that time, the creature is tapped, it's affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block, or no creatures are attacking its controller or a planeswalker controlled by that player, then it doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having the creature block, the player isn't forced to pay that cost. If that cost isn't paid, the creature won't block.
* The controller of the creature chooses which attacking creature that creature blocks.
* You choose whether you want the creature to gain reach until end of turn as Academic Dispute resolves.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Academic+Probation)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academic+Probation)
Academic Probation  

{1}{W}  

Sorcery — Lesson  

Choose one —  

• Choose a nonland card name. Opponents can't cast spells with the chosen name until your next turn.  

• Choose target nonland permanent. Until your next turn, it can't attack or block, and its activated abilities can't be activated.


* For the first mode, no one can cast spells between the time a card is named and the time that Academic Probation's effect starts to apply.
* Academic Probation is a sorcery, but in some unusual cases it may be cast in response to other spells. Spells with the chosen name that somehow happen to already be on the stack when Academic Probation resolves will not be affected.
* Although spells with the chosen name can't be cast, a card with that name can still be put onto the battlefield by another effect (if it's a permanent card).
* You can name either face of a modal double-faced card, but not both, and you can name either half of a split card, but not both. Opponents may still cast the face or half you didn't name.
* If you target a noncreature permanent with the second mode and it later becomes a creature, that creature still won't be able to attack or block until your next turn.
* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as equip) are activated abilities and will have a colon in their reminder text. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected.

{T}: Add {C}.  

{3}, {T}: Target creature with power 3 or less can't be blocked this turn.


* Once a creature with power 3 or less has been blocked, Access Tunnel's second ability won't cause it to become unblocked.
* If the target creature's power is greater than 3 as Access Tunnel's second ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. However, if instead the creature's power is raised above 3 after the ability resolves, it still can't be blocked that turn.

{T}: Add one mana of any color.  

{T}: Add X mana of any one color, where X is the amount of life you gained this turn.


* Accomplished Alchemist's second ability counts the total amount of life gained without taking into account any life you lost during that turn. For example, if you lost 3 life and gained 3 life earlier in the turn, you'll add three mana.

* You must choose two legal targets in order to cast Aether Helix. If there are either no permanent cards in your graveyard or no permanents on the battlefield, you cannot begin to cast it.
* If only one target is still legal as Aether Helix tries to resolve, it will still resolve and perform the appropriate action on the remaining target.

Whenever Ardent Dustspeaker attacks, you may put an instant or sorcery card from your graveyard on the bottom of your library. If you do, exile the top two cards of your library. You may play those cards this turn.


* The cards exiled by Ardent Dustspeaker's ability are exiled face up.
* You may play those cards that turn even if Ardent Dustspeaker leaves the battlefield or another player gains control of it.
* Playing the cards exiled with Ardent Dustspeaker follows the normal rules for playing those cards. You must pay their costs, if any, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if one of the cards is a creature card, you can cast that card by paying its mana cost only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
* Unless an effect allows you to play additional lands that turn, you can play land cards exiled with Ardent Dustspeaker only if you haven't played a land yet that turn. In most cases, if you exile two land cards, you won't be able to play both.
* Any cards exiled with Ardent Dustspeaker that you don't play remain exiled. You will not be able to play them on later turns, even if Ardent Dustspeaker's ability triggers again.

Trample  

As long as you control eight or more lands, Augmenter Pugilist gets +5/+5.

Echoing Equation  

{3}{U}{U}  

Sorcery  

Choose target creature you control. Each other creature you control becomes a copy of it until end of turn, except those creatures aren't legendary if the chosen creature is legendary.


* Because damage remains marked on creatures until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Augmenter Pugilist may become lethal if the number of lands you control falls below eight.
* Echoing Equation copies the printed values of the target creature. It won't copy any counters on that creature or any effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on, and a creature becoming a copy doesn't remove any such counters or effects that are already applying to it. Notably, Echoing Equation won't copy any type-changing effects that are currently making the target a creature. For example, if you choose a land that's become a creature, all your other creatures will become noncreature lands until end of turn.
* If the chosen creature is copying something else, other creatures you control become copies of whatever the chosen creature is copying.
* If the target creature is a token, other creatures you control will copy the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. Any of those creatures that aren't tokens won't become tokens in this case. Similarly, if the target creature is a nontoken creature, creature tokens you control won't stop being tokens.
* Echoing Equation affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures that come under your control later in the turn won't be copies of the chosen creature.

As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature or pay {3}.


* You must sacrifice exactly one creature or pay an extra {3} to cast this spell; you can't cast it without paying one of those costs, and you can't pay either multiple times.
* Players can respond to Bayou Groff only after it's been cast and all its costs have been paid. No one can try to destroy the creature you sacrificed to stop you from casting this spell or to make it cost more mana.

A creature without double strike won't deal regular combat damage if it already dealt first-strike damage that turn.

Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on Blood Researcher.


* If you gain life at the same time Blood Researcher is dealt lethal damage, it dies before its ability can put a +1/+1 counter on it.
* An ability that triggers "whenever you gain life" triggers just once for each life gain event, no matter how much life you gain.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life gain event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, a "whenever you gain life" ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability will trigger only once.

You can't cast permanent spells.  

{4}, {T}: Add {W}{U}{B}{R}{G}. When you cast your next spell this turn, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile an instant or sorcery card with lesser mana value. Until end of turn, you may cast that card without paying its mana cost. Put each other card exiled this way on the bottom of your library in a random order.


* A permanent spell is an artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker spell. You may still play lands and cast instant and sorcery spells. Other effects can still put permanents onto the battlefield.
* While you control Codie (as much as anyone can really "control" Codie), you may cast any face of a modal double-faced card that's an instant or sorcery face, even if the other face is a permanent face.
* Codie's activated ability is a mana ability. It can't be countered or responded to, and you can activate it while casting a spell. If you do, that spell is "the next spell" you cast this turn.
* The delayed triggered ability created by Codie's second ability will resolve before the spell that caused it to trigger. That ability will resolve even if the spell is countered or otherwise doesn't resolve.
* You exile the cards face up. All players will be able to see them.
* The last card exiled is not cast immediately. You may cast it until the end of the current turn. If you do not cast it, that card will remain in exile.
* If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the spell.
* If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
* The mana value of the spell that caused the ability to trigger is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
* The types and mana value of a double-faced card in exile are determined by the characteristics of its front face. The mana value of a split card is the total mana value of both halves of the split card added together.
* If you exile your entire library without exiling an instant or sorcery card with a lesser mana value, you will randomize the exiled cards and they again become your library, ending the effect. You will not continue to exile and shuffle your library forever.

Whenever Conspiracy Theorist attacks, you may pay {1} and discard a card. If you do, draw a card.  

Whenever you discard one or more nonland cards, you may exile one of them from your graveyard. If you do, you may cast it this turn.


* While resolving Conspiracy Theorist's ability, you can't pay {1} and discard a card multiple times to draw more cards.
* The card exiled by the second ability is exiled face up. Casting it follows the normal rules for casting that card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if it's a creature card, you can cast it only during your main phase while the stack is empty. In most cases, if you exile a non-instant card during an opponent's turn, you won't be able to cast it that turn.

* If Containment Breach resolves, and the target artifact has a mana value of 2 or less, but it wasn't destroyed (perhaps because it has indestructible), you will still create a Pest.
* If the artifact or enchantment is an illegal target as Containment Breach tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. You won't create a Pest.

* If you cast Deadly Brew and control any creatures or planeswalkers as it resolves, you must sacrifice one of them.

* Dina's first ability triggers only once for each life gain event, no matter how much life was gained.
* When Dina's first ability resolves, each opponent loses only 1 life, no matter how much life was gained.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life gain event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, a "whenever you gain life" ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* X is the power the creature had when it was on the battlefield, not the power it has in the graveyard.

Dragon's Approach deals 3 damage to each opponent. You may exile Dragon's Approach and four cards named Dragon's Approach from your graveyard. If you do, search your library for a Dragon creature card, put it onto the battlefield, then shuffle.  

A deck can have any number of cards named Dragon's Approach.


* In most cases, you'll need to exile five cards named Dragon's Approach (the resolving one from the stack plus four more from your graveyard) to search for a Dragon card. However, if Dragon's Approach is a copy, you can still exile it along with four cards named Dragon's Approach from your graveyard to search for a Dragon card. The exiled copy will then cease to exist.

Specifically, the second ability granted to the target creature doesn't care that the creature's controller is the one exiling it.

* If an effect instructs you to "double" a creature's power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is its power as that effect begins to apply. (This is not the value of X you chose when you cast the spell)
* Exponential Growth doubles a creature's power sequentially, not all at the same time. For example, if X is 3 and you target a 2/2 creature, you will double its power once to 4, again to 8, and a third time to 16, making it a 16/2 creature until end of turn.
* If a creature's power is less than 0 when it's doubled, instead that creature gets -X/-0, where X is how much less than 0 its power is. For example, if an effect has given a 5/5 creature -7/-0 so that it's a -2/5 creature, doubling its power makes it a -4/5 creature.

Look at the top three cards of your library. Put one of them into your hand, put one of them on the bottom of your library, and exile one of them. You may play the exiled card this turn.


* Cards exiled are always exiled face up unless specified otherwise by the effect that exiled it.
* If you choose to play the exiled card this turn, you must still pay all costs and follow all timing restrictions required by that card. If it's a land, you can't play it unless you have a land play available.
* If you don't play the exiled card, it remains exiled. It won't be available to be played on future turns.

Awaken the Blood Avatar  

{6}{B}{R}  

Sorcery  

As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may sacrifice any number of creatures. This spell costs {2} less to cast for each creature sacrificed this way.  

Each opponent sacrifices a creature. Create a 3/6 black and red Avatar creature token with haste and "Whenever this creature attacks, it deals 3 damage to each opponent."


* Returning a nonlegendary creature card is not optional. If there is at least one in your graveyard, you must target it with the magecraft ability.
* Awaken the Blood Avatar's first ability can't reduce its cost below {B}{R}. However, you can sacrifice any number of creatures, even if they won't reduce its cost any further.
* Include any additional costs to cast Awaken the Blood Avatar before applying its own cost reduction. For example, if Extus is your commander, and an additional cost of {6} applies from the "commander tax," you may cast Awaken the Blood Avatar by sacrificing four creatures and paying {4}{B}{R}.
* As Awaken the Blood Avatar resolves, first the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's an opponent's turn, the opponent whose turn it is) chooses a creature they control, then each other opponent in turn order does the same knowing the choices made before them. Then all the chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time.
* The Blood Avatar will be awakened even if no player has creatures to sacrifice when it resolves.

You may pay {2}{R}{R} rather than pay this spell's mana cost.  

If the {2}{R}{R} cost was paid, an opponent discards any number of cards, then draws that many cards.  

Search your library for up to three cards, put them into your hand, shuffle, then discard three cards at random.


* If the {2}{R}{R} cost was paid, the opponent chooses how many and which cards to discard as Fervent Mastery resolves. They may choose to discard no cards.

* An activated ability that costs mana to activate is not a "mana ability" unless it could also produce mana and has no targets.
* Activated abilities contain a colon and appear in the form "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keywords (such as equip) are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts. Loyalty abilities of planeswalkers are also activated abilities.
* Casting Revel in Silence in response to a spell or ability won't affect that spell or ability. That is, it's not countermagic.

* Fortifying Draught counts the total amount of life gained without considering any life you lost during that turn. For example, if you lost 2 life and gained 3 life earlier in the turn, you will gain 2 more life from Fortifying Draught and the target creature will get +5/+5.

* If you have more cards in hand than your maximum hand size (usually seven) during the cleanup step of your turn, you will need to discard cards down to your maximum hand size.

Legendary Creature — Dwarf Cleric

Spirits you control get +1/+1 and have trample and haste.  

Whenever another nontoken creature you control dies, exile it. If you do, create a token that's a copy of that creature, except it's a Spirit in addition to its other types and it has "When this creature leaves the battlefield, return the exiled card to your graveyard."


* Hofri Ghostforge's last ability is linked to the ability it grants the Spirit token. If a replacement effect causes you to create more than one Spirit token with this effect, they will all have that ability, and the exiled card will be returned to the graveyard if any of them leaves the battlefield.
* If another creature enters the battlefield as a copy of the Spirit token or another effect creates a copy of the Spirit token, it will have the triggered ability granted by Hofri, but will not be linked to Hofri's ability and will not return the card to the graveyard when it leaves the battlefield.
* Each Spirit token you create refers only to the card you exile during the resolution of the ability that created that token. When it leaves the battlefield, you return only that card to your graveyard, not any other card exiled by Hofri.
* If you can't exile the card, perhaps because another effect moved the card before the triggered ability started resolving, you won't create a token.
* The copy uses the copiable values of the creature as it last existed on the battlefield before it died, not as it existed in the graveyard before it was exiled.
* The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless the creature was copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature was tapped or untapped, whether it had any counters on it or Auras or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* If the copied creature was copying something else, then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the creature will also work.

* You may choose not to discard any cards as Illuminate History resolves. In that case, you will not draw any cards, but you might still create a Spirit.
* Illuminate History will stay on the stack until it is finished resolving, so it will not count itself as one of the cards in your graveyard.

Sorcery  

You may put any number of land cards from your hand onto the battlefield. Then if you control eight or more lands, you may discard a card. If you do, return Journey to the Oracle to its owner's hand.


* Putting a land onto the battlefield does not count as playing a land for the turn and doesn't use the normal timing restrictions.
* You may choose not to cast a nonland card revealed by Jadzi's triggered ability. If you don't cast it, it stays on top of your library.
* If you're casting the card you reveal with Jadzi's ability, you ignore normal timing restrictions.
* If you reveal a modal double-faced card with Jadzi's triggered ability, and both faces are nonland, you may cast either face by paying {1} rather than its mana cost. If only the back face is a land, you may cast the front face. If both faces are lands, you will put onto the battlefield front face up.
* If you cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost using Jadzi's magecraft ability, you must choose 0 as the value of X.
* Because the magecraft ability supplies an alternative cost of {1} for the spell, you cannot pay any other alternative costs that may apply. However, you may pay additional costs and must pay any additional costs that are required.
* You may activate Jadzi's activated ability only while Jadzi is on the battlefield. If Jadzi is no longer on the battlefield as the ability resolves, it won't return her to your hand from any other zone.

* Each other planeswalker you control gains Kasmina's loyalty abilities in addition to their own. For each planeswalker you control, you may still activate only one of that planeswalker's loyalty abilities per turn.
* When you activate Kasmina's last loyalty ability on another planeswalker, you search your library for a card that shares a color with that planeswalker, not with Kasmina. You can't search for a colorless card, even if the planeswalker is colorless.

* You can't cast Mage Duel unless you choose both a creature you control and a creature you don't control as targets.
* If the creature you control is an illegal target as Mage Duel tries to resolve, that creature won't get +1/+2. If that creature is a legal target, but the one you don't control isn't, your creature will still get +1/+2. In both cases, no fight will happen and no creature will deal or be dealt damage.

* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Mortality Spear). Mortality Spear's mana value is always 4, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.

* Multiple Choice doesn't have any targets.
* Effects that increase or decrease costs are applied after you choose the value of X, and will not impact the results of the spell.
* You can choose 0 as the value of X as you cast Multiple Choice, but it will have no effect when it resolves.
* If an effect allows you to cast Multiple Choice without paying its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X. Cheating on tests is frowned upon.

Return up to two target creature, land, and/or planeswalker cards from your graveyard to your hand. Each player gains 4 life. Exile Restorative Burst.


* Pestilent Cauldron's second ability counts the total amount of life gained without considering any life you lost during that turn. For example, if you lost 2 life and gained 2 life earlier in the turn, your opponents will mill two cards.
* You must be able to target four cards in a single graveyard in order to activate Pestilent Cauldron's last ability.
* You may cast Restorative Burst with no targets. If you do, each player will gain 4 life and you'll exile Restorative Burst. However, if you choose one or two target cards, and each of those cards is an illegal target as Restorative Burst tries to resolve (usually because something else moved them in response), Restorative Burst won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. No one will gain life, and Restorative Burst won't be exiled.

Pigment Storm  

{3}{R}{R}  

Sorcery  

Pigment Storm deals 5 damage to target creature. Excess damage is dealt to that creature's controller instead.


* Excess damage caused by a spell or ability is similar to how combat damage from a creature with trample is handled. Start with the amount of damage being dealt to the creature and determine what is "lethal." This is the creature's toughness minus the amount of damage that it already has marked on it, but ignoring any replacement or prevention effects that will modify this damage. Also ignore whether the creature has an ability such as indestructible that will result in it not being destroyed by this damage.
* Once you've determined how much damage is excess, Pigment Storm simultaneously deals damage to the creature and to its controller. This damage may be modified by replacement or prevention effects.
* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Pigment Storm tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve. It won't deal damage to any player.
* Pigment Storm's replacement effect is a self-replacement effect. It is applied before any other replacement effects that would change the amount of damage dealt to the target creature and its controller.

* Despite the term "other tapped creatures," Augusta's first ability doesn't care whether Augusta is tapped or untapped. The same is true for the second ability. Both abilities apply as long as Augusta is on the battlefield.
* Augusta's last ability triggers whenever you attack with any creatures, even if you didn't attack with Augusta.
* Augusta's last ability untaps all creatures you control, not just the ones that attacked this turn. Then you choose which creatures to tap, if any.

Legendary Planeswalker — Liliana

*Magecraft* — Whenever you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell, each opponent loses 2 life and you gain 2 life.  

+1: You lose 1 life. Look at the top three cards of your library. Put one of them into your hand and the rest into your graveyard.  

−3: Each opponent sacrifices a creature with the greatest power among creatures that player controls.  

−8: Each opponent may discard a card. If they don't, they lose 3 life. Repeat this process six more times.


* For Professor Onyx's second loyalty ability, if an opponent has multiple creatures with the greatest power, that player choose which one to sacrifice. The next opponent in turn order chooses which creature they are sacrificing, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Then all chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time.
* For Professor Onyx's last loyalty ability, "this process" is the following: First, the next opponent in turn order may choose a card in hand without revealing it, then each other opponent in turn order does the same. Then all the chosen cards are revealed and discarded at the same time and each opponent who didn't discard a card (whether they chose not to or had an empty hand) loses 3 life. This all will happen seven times, for a maximum loss of 21 life per opponent.
* If Professor Onyx seems familiar, it's probably because you've seen this type of planeswalker before.

* You still pay the mana cost when casting the exiled card, and you must follow all timing rules for it.
* If an instant or sorcery spell you control with lifelink deals damage to you, you gain and lose that much life simultaneously. In this case, your life total doesn't change. (You may gain life if the spell also deals damage to other permanents and/or players, however.)
* Some instant and sorcery spells instruct other things to deal damage rather than deal damage themselves. In these cases, you won't gain life for that damage (unless the other things also have lifelink). Notably, a spell that instructs a creature you control to fight won't cause you to gain life.

* If a creature's power is less than 0 when it's doubled, instead that creature gets -X/-0, where X is how much less than 0 its power is. For example, if an effect has given Reckless Amplimancer -4/-0 so that it's a -2/2 creature, doubling its power and toughness gives it -2/+2, and it becomes a -4/4 creature.

* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Rowan or Will's first ability). The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
* For Rowan's emblem, you can pay {2} only once. You can't pay more to copy the spell more than once.
* For Will's first loyalty ability, any effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness without setting them to a specific value (i.e. ones that don't affect base power and/or toughness) will apply after its base power and toughness are set, regardless of the order those effects were created. The same is true for counters that modify its power and toughness.

Spiteful Squad enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it.  

When Spiteful Squad dies, put its counters on target creature you control.


* Spiteful Squad puts all of its counters onto the target creature, not just its +1/+1 counters.
* Spiteful Squad's ability doesn't cause you to move counters from itself to the target creature. Rather, you put the same number of each kind of counter Spiteful Squad had when it died onto that creature.
* In some unusual cases, you may end up putting the appropriate counters on more than one permanent. For example, if you control The Ozolith when Spiteful Squad dies, you will put the appropriate number of each kind of counter onto both The Ozolith and the target creature.
* If Spiteful Squad has -1/-1 counters on it when it dies, the last ability will include those as well. This may result in the recipient also dying. Spiteful indeed.

Target creature has base power and toughness 4/4 until end of turn.

* Any effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness without setting them to a specific value (i.e. ones that don't affect base power and/or toughness) will apply after its base power and toughness are set, regardless of the order those effects were created. The same is true for counters that modify its power and toughness.

Whenever a permanent entering the battlefield causes a triggered ability to trigger, counter that ability unless its controller pays {2}.


* Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]."
* Effects that modify how a creature enters the battlefield are not triggered abilities and are not affected by Strict Proctor's ability. These include (but aren't limited to) effects that have a permanent enter the battlefield as a copy of another permanent, effects that have a permanent enter with counters, and effects that have a permanent enter tapped.
* Abilities that trigger when something else causes an ability to trigger will always go on the stack after the ability that caused them to trigger. For example, Strict Proctor's ability will always resolve before the triggered ability that caused it to trigger does. This is a change from previous rules.

{T}: Add {C}. Put a point counter on Strixhaven Stadium.  

Whenever a creature deals combat damage to you, remove a point counter from Strixhaven Stadium.  

Whenever a creature you control deals combat damage to an opponent, put a point counter on Strixhaven Stadium. Then if it has ten or more point counters on it, remove them all and that player loses the game.


* "That player" refers to the opponent who was dealt damage.
* If multiple creatures deal combat damage to you or an opponent at the same time, the appropriate ability of Strixhaven Stadium will trigger that many times. You can put these abilities on the stack in any order. The last ability put on the stack will be the first to resolve.
* In a multiplayer game, if creatures you control deal combat damage to multiple opponents at the same time, the last ability will trigger multiple times. However, because the counters are removed, it is difficult (but not impossible) to make multiple players lose the game from this ability in the same combat phase.
* The check for ten or more point counters happens only as the last ability is resolving. Notably, if you add the tenth point counter some other way, no one will lose the game . . . yet.

When Tanazir Quandrix enters the battlefield, double the number of +1/+1 counters on target creature you control.  

Whenever Tanazir Quandrix attacks, you may have the base power and toughness of other creatures you control become equal to Tanazir Quandrix's power and toughness until end of turn.


* To double the number of +1/+1 counters on a permanent, put a number of +1/+1 counters on it equal to the number it already has. Other cards that interact with putting counters on it will interact with this effect accordingly.
* As the last ability resolves, the base power and toughness of other creatures you control are set to Tanazir Quandrix's actual power and toughness, not just its base power and toughness. If Tanazir Quandrix's power or toughness changes later in the turn, the other creatures you control aren't affected.
* Tanazir Quandrix's last ability overwrites all previous effects that set a creature's power and toughness to specific values. Other effects that set its power or toughness to specific values that start to apply after the ability resolves will overwrite this effect.
* Any effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness without setting them to a specific value (i.e. ones that don't affect base power and/or toughness) will apply after its base power and toughness are set, regardless of the order those effects were created.

Counter target instant or sorcery spell. Search its controller's graveyard, hand, and library for any number of cards with the same name as that spell and exile them. That player shuffles, then draws a card for each card exiled from their hand this way.


* Countering a spell normally puts that card into the graveyard, so that card will be there to find and exile.
* If the back face of a modal double-faced card is countered, you will not be able to exile any cards, including the one that you countered, because those cards have only their front-face characteristics (including name) in the graveyard, hand, and library.

When you discard an instant or sorcery card this way, the reflexive triggered ability triggers and you pick a target to be dealt damage. This is different from effects that say "If you do . . ." in that players can respond to the triggered ability knowing how much damage will be dealt.

Whenever you cast a spell from exile, put a +1/+1 counter on Nassari, Dean of Expression.


* After removing the last hone counter, casting the spell is optional. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored. If an effect prohibits you from casting the card or you choose not to cast it, it remains exiled with no hone counters on it, and you won't be able to cast it later.
* The cost reduction given by Uvilda, Dean of Perfection won't reduce any colored mana requirements in the spell's cost.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Uvilda, Dean of Perfection). The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
* You exile cards with Nassari, Dean of Expression face up. Casting those spells is subject to the normal timing restrictions for spells.
* Any cards exiled with Nassari's ability that you don't cast will remain exiled. You won't be able to cast those cards on future turns, although Nassari's ability will give you another group of cards to choose from each time it resolves.
* Nassari's last ability triggers when you cast any spell from exile, not just the cards that were exiled with its first ability.

Whenever you gain life, you may pay {1}. If you do, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control and those creatures gain trample until end of turn.


* If a nontoken creature an opponent controls would die, and both Valentin and another effect are trying to exile it instead, that opponent chooses which effect to apply. If Valentin's effect ends up not applying because of this choice, the triggered ability that allows you to pay {2} won't trigger, even if the creature card ends up in exile.
* If you gain life at the same time a creature you control is dealt lethal damage, that creature dies before Lisette's ability can put a +1/+1 counter on it.
* An ability that triggers "whenever you gain life" triggers just once for each life-gaining event, no matter how much life you gain.
* You may only pay {1} once for each life gain event.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, a "whenever you gain life" ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability will trigger only once.

* For Wandering Archaic's triggered ability, the opponent chooses whether to pay {2} before their spell resolves. If they don't pay {2}, your copy will resolve before the original spell.
* Explore the Vastlands has received an update to its Oracle text. The official text is listed above. Specifically, revealing either a land card or an instant or sorcery card is optional. Any player who can't reveal a card or chooses not to simply puts all cards they looked at on the bottom of their library in a random order. Each player gains 3 life whether they revealed a card or not.

If this spell was cast from your hand and you've cast another spell named Approach of the Second Sun this game, you win the game. Otherwise, put Approach of the Second Sun into its owner's library seventh from the top and you gain 7 life.


* A card that changes zones is considered a new object, so casting the same Approach of the Second Sun card on a later turn is "another spell" named Approach of the Second Sun.
* If you have fewer than six cards in your library, you'll put Approach of the Second Sun on the bottom of your library. Otherwise, you'll lift up the top six cards without looking at them and place Approach of the Second Sun just under them.
* The second Approach of the Second Sun that you cast must be cast from your hand, but first may have been cast from anywhere.
* A copy of a spell isn't cast, so it won't count as the first nor as the second Approach of the Second Sun.
* As your second Approach of the Second Sun resolves, it checks only whether the first one was cast, not whether the first one resolved. If your first Approach of the Second Sun was countered, you'll still win the game as your second one resolves.

Exile target artifact, creature, or enchantment an opponent controls. That player may put a permanent card from their hand onto the battlefield.


* A permanent card is a card with one or more of the following card types: artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker.
* If the artifact, creature, or enchantment is an illegal target as Divine Gambit tries to resolve, Divine Gambit won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. No player will put any cards onto the battlefield.
* If the player chooses to put a double-faced card onto the battlefield, it enters with its front face up. They may do this only if the front face of the card is a permanent card.

Electrolyze deals 2 damage divided as you choose among one or two targets.

* If Electrolyze targets two creatures and one becomes an illegal target, the remaining target is dealt 1 damage, not 2. You'll still draw a card.
* If all chosen targets are illegal as Electrolyze tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. No damage will be dealt and you won't draw a card.

Instant  

Exile target creature you control, then return it to the battlefield under its owner's control.  

Rebound *(If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast this card from exile without paying its mana cost.)*


* Once the exiled creature returns, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
* Casting Ephemerate again due to rebound's delayed triggered ability is optional. If you choose not to cast the card, or if you can't (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the card will stay exiled. You won't get another chance to cast it on a future turn. If you do cast the card, it's put into its owner's graveyard as normal once it resolves.
* If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand is countered or doesn't resolve (most likely because its targets have become illegal), none of its effects will happen, including rebound. The spell will be put into its owner's graveyard and you won't get to cast it again on your next turn.

* You can't choose "artifact" or "colorless" as Gods Willing asks you to choose a color because those are not colors.
* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Gods Willing tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You won't scry 1.

Grapeshot deals 1 damage to any target.  

Storm *(When you cast this spell, copy it for each spell cast before it this turn. You may choose new targets for the copies.)*


* Each copy you create because of storm will cause your magecraft abilities to trigger.
* The copies are put directly onto the stack. They aren't cast and won't be counted by other spells with storm cast later in the turn.
* Spells cast from zones other than a player's hand and spells that were countered or didn't resolve are counted by the storm ability.
* A copy of a spell can be countered like any other spell, but it must be countered individually. Countering a spell with storm won't affect the copies.
* The triggered ability that creates the copies can itself be countered by anything that can counter a triggered ability. If it is countered, no copies will be put onto the stack.
* You may choose new targets for any of the copies. You can choose differently for each copy.

Increasing Vengeance  

{R}{R}  

Instant  

Copy target instant or sorcery spell you control. If this spell was cast from a graveyard, copy that spell twice instead. You may choose new targets for the copies.  

Flashback {3}{R}{R} *(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)*


* If you copy the spell twice, each magecraft ability of a creature you control will trigger twice.
* Increasing Vengeance can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell you control, not just one with targets.
* When Increasing Vengeance resolves, it creates one or two copies of a spell. You control each of the copies. Those copies are created on the stack, so they're not cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copies will then resolve like normal spells, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* Each of the copies will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal). If there are two copies, you may change the targets of each of them to different legal targets.
* If the spell Increasing Vengeance copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copies will have the same mode(s). You can't choose different ones.
* If the spell Increasing Vengeance copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Blue Sun's Zenith does), the copy has the same value of X.
* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copies. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copies too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling and then copy it with Increasing Vengeance, the copies of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.

Split second *(As long as this spell is on the stack, players can't cast spells or activate abilities that aren't mana abilities.)*  

Destroy target artifact or enchantment.


* Players still get priority while a card with split second is on the stack.
* Split second doesn't prevent players from activating mana abilities.
* Split second doesn't prevent triggered abilities from triggering. If one does, its controller puts it on the stack and chooses targets for it, if any. Those abilities will resolve as normal.
* Split second doesn't prevent triggered abilities from copying spells, like that of the emblem created by Rowan, Scholar of Sparks.
* Split second doesn't prevent players from performing special actions. Notably, players may turn face-down creatures face up while a spell with split second is on the stack.
* Casting a spell with split second won't affect spells or abilities that are already on the stack.
* If the resolution of a triggered ability involves casting a spell, that spell can't be cast if a spell with split second is on the stack.

{4}{U}{U}  

Sorcery  

Shuffle your library. Then exile the top card of your library. Until end of turn, you may play that card without paying its mana cost.  

Storm *(When you cast this spell, copy it for each spell cast before it this turn.)*


* Each copy you create because of the storm triggered ability will cause your magecraft abilities to trigger.
* Although each copy of Mind's Desire instructs you to shuffle your library and exile a single card, players commonly agree to a shortcut and shuffle only once before exiling the appropriate number of cards. This shortcut should be used only if nothing happens in between each copy resolving to change the order of the library.
* The cards are exiled face up.
* Any cards exiled by Mind's Desire that aren't played that turn remain exiled. They won't be available to play on future turns.
* The copies are put directly onto the stack. They aren't cast and won't be counted by other spells with storm cast later in the turn.
* Spells cast from zones other than a player's hand and spells that were countered are counted by the storm ability.
* A copy of a spell can be countered like any other spell, but it must be countered individually. Countering a spell with storm won't affect the copies.
* The triggered ability that creates the copies can itself be countered by anything that can counter a triggered ability. If it is countered, no copies will be put onto the stack.

Exile target card that's an instant or sorcery from your graveyard. For each card exiled this way, copy it, and you may cast the copy without paying its mana cost. Exile Mizzix's Mastery.  

Overload {5}{R}{R}{R} *(You may cast this spell for its overload cost. If you do, change its text by replacing all instances of "target" with "each.")*


* Copying the cards doesn't cause magecraft abilities to trigger, although casting those copies does.
* If Mizzix's Mastery exiled multiple cards, you may cast the copies in any order. The last copy you cast will be the first one to resolve.
* If you don't cast one of the copies (perhaps because there are no legal targets available or you don't want to), the copy will cease to exist.
* Mizzix's Mastery is still on the stack as it resolves. If you pay the overload cost, Mizzix's Mastery won't be exiled by the first part of the effect or copied.
* The copies are created and cast during the resolution of Mizzix's Mastery. You can't wait to cast them later in the turn. Timing restrictions based on the copy's type are ignored. Other restrictions (such as "Cast [this name] only during combat") are not.
* If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the copy has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X.
* The cards remain exiled no matter what happens to the copies.

* Sacrificing a green creature is part of Natural Order's cost. You can't sacrifice more creatures to search for more creature cards, and you can't cast Natural Order at all if you control no green creatures.
* Players can respond to this spell only after it's been cast and all its costs have been paid. No one can try to destroy the creature you sacrificed to stop you from casting this spell or to make you sacrifice a different one.

* Primal Command's modes are performed in the order listed. If you put a noncreature permanent on top of its owner's library and have that player shuffle their graveyard into their library, that card is shuffled away.
* Primal Command won't be put into your graveyard until after it's finished resolving, which means it won't be shuffled into your library as part of its own effect if you target yourself with its third mode.
* If Primal Command is cast with two targets and one of those targets illegal as it tries to resolve, it will resolve and do as much as it can to the targets that are still legal.

Teferi's Protection  

{2}{W}  

Instant  

Until your next turn, your life total can't change and you gain protection from everything. All permanents you control phase out. *(While they're phased out, they're treated as though they don't exist. They phase in before you untap during your untap step.)*  

Exile Teferi's Protection.


---------- The following rulings focus on the "protection from everything" keyword ----------


* If a player has protection from everything, it means three things: 1) All damage that would be dealt to that player is prevented. 2) Auras can't be attached to that player. 3) That player can't be the target of spells or abilities.
* Nothing other than the specified events are prevented or illegal. An effect that doesn't target you could still cause you to discard cards, for example. Creatures can still attack you while you have protection from everything, although combat damage that they would deal to you will be prevented.
* Gaining protection from everything causes a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target if it targets you. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.

---------- The following rulings focus on what it means if your life total can't change ----------


* Spells and abilities that would normally cause you to gain or lose life still resolve while your life total can't change, but the life-gain or life-loss part simply has no effect.
* Protection from everything will usually prevent damage if it would be dealt to you, but some damage can't be prevented. In this case, because your life total can't change, that damage will still have any other effects (such as effects from lifelink or infect) that it may have aside from causing you to lose that much life, and triggers and effects can see that damage was dealt even though your life total didn't change.
* You can't pay a cost that includes the payment of any amount of life other than 0 life.
* If a cost includes causing you to gain life (like the alternative cost of an opponent's Invigorate does), that cost can't be paid.
* Effects that would replace having you gain life with some other event won't be able to be applied because it's impossible for you to gain life. The same is true for effects that would replace having you lose life with some other event.
* Effects that replace an event with having you gain life (like Words of Worship's effect does) or having you lose life will apply and end up replacing the event with nothing.
* If an effect would set your life total to a certain number that's different than your current life total, that part of the effect won't do anything.
* If an effect would cause you to exchange life totals with another player, the exchange won't happen. Neither player's life total changes.

---------- The following rulings focus on the phasing keyword ----------


* While a permanent is phased out, it's treated as though it doesn't exist. It can't be the target of spells or abilities, its static abilities have no effect on the game, its triggered abilities can't trigger, it can't attack or block, and so on.
* Phasing out doesn't cause any "leaves the battlefield" abilities to trigger. Similarly, phasing in won't cause any "enters the battlefield" abilities to trigger.
* Any one-shot effects that are waiting "until [this] leaves the battlefield," such as that of Banishing Light, won't happen when a permanent phases out.
* Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration such as that of Mathas, Fiend Seeker ignore phased-out objects. Any such effects will expire if their conditions are no longer met after ignoring the phased-out objects.
* Each Aura and Equipment that phases out attached to a permanent that's phasing out phases in with that permanent and still attached to it.
* Each Aura and Equipment you control attached to a permanent that isn't phasing out phases in attached to that permanent if it can still be attached to that permanent. If not, it phases in unattached. An Aura that phases in unattached will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. The same is true with Auras attached to players.
* Permanents that phase out with counters phase in with those counters.
* Choices made for permanents as they entered the battlefield are remembered when they phase in.
* If a token is phased out, it will phase in as your next untap step begins.
* A permanent phasing out causes a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target if it targets that permanent. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.
* If your untap step is somehow skipped as your next turn begins, your phased-out permanents won't phase in until the next untap step you actually have, but you'll no longer have protection from everything and your life total can change again.
* Any creatures that phase in under your control as your next untap step begins will be able to attack and pay a cost of {T} during that turn.
* If you gain control of another player's permanent and it phases out, if the duration of the control-change effect expires before it phases in, that permanent phases in under that other player's control as your next untap step begins. If you leave the game before your next untap step, it phases in as the next untap step begins after your turn would have begun.

* As you cast a spell with one or more Phyrexian mana symbols in its cost, you choose how to pay for each Phyrexian mana symbol at the same time you would choose modes or choose a value for X.

You gain 3 life.  

Storm *(When you cast this spell, copy it for each spell cast before it this turn.)*


* Each copy you create because of storm will cause your magecraft abilities to trigger.
* The copies are put directly onto the stack. They aren't cast and won't be counted by other spells with storm cast later in the turn.
* Spells cast from zones other than a player's hand and spells that were countered are counted by the storm ability.
* A copy of a spell can be countered like any other spell, but it must be countered individually. Countering a spell with storm won't affect the copies.
* The triggered ability that creates the copies can itself be countered by anything that can counter a triggered ability. If it is countered, no copies will be put onto the stack.

Instant  

For each spell and ability your opponents control, counter it unless its controller pays {4}.


* Among abilities, only activated and triggered abilities use the stack. Activated abilities are written in the form "[Cost]: [Effect]." Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts, and some keyword abilities are triggered abilities and will have "when," "whenever," or "at" in their reminder texts.
* As Whirlwind Denial resolves, first the opponent whose turn it is (or, if it's your turn, the next opponent in turn order) chooses which spells and/or abilities to pay for, then pays that amount. Then each other opponent in turn order does the same. Then all spells and abilities that weren't paid for are countered at the same time.

Alibou, Ancient Witness

Legendary Artifact Creature — Golem  

4/5  

Other artifact creatures you control have haste.  

Whenever one or more artifact creatures you control attack, Alibou, Ancient Witness deals X damage to any target and you scry X, where X is the number of tapped artifacts you control.


* If Alibou leaves the battlefield, artifact creatures you control lose haste. If they haven't been under your control since the turn began and don't otherwise have haste, they can't attack that turn. If they've already attacked, losing haste won't remove them from combat and they'll remain attackers.
* You choose a target as Alibou's triggered ability is put on the stack. If that target isn't legal as the triggered ability tries to resolve, it doesn't resolve and you don't scry.
* If you control no tapped artifacts when the triggered ability resolves (perhaps because they were destroyed or had vigilance), no damage will be dealt and you won't scry.

Whenever a land enters the battlefield under an opponent's control, if that player controls more lands than you, you may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield.


* The last ability triggers only if that opponent controls more lands than you after the land enters the battlefield. The ability will check again as it tries to resolve. If that opponent doesn't still control more lands than you at that time, the ability won't resolve.

* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as boast) are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. An activated mana ability is one that produces mana as it resolves, not one that costs mana to activate.
* Copying abilities doesn't cause magecraft abilities to trigger.
* The copy will have the same targets as the ability it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the ability is modal (that is, it has a bulleted list of modes), the copy will have the same mode(s). You can't choose new ones.
* If the ability has {X} in its activation cost, the copy has the same value of X.

* Once a ward ability has triggered, it doesn't matter if the artifact loses ward (most likely because Bronze Guardian leaves the battlefield in response) before the ability resolves. The controller of the spell or ability will still have to pay {2} or the spell or ability will be countered.

Whenever an opponent attacks you and/or one or more planeswalkers you control, exile the top card of that player's library. You may play that card for as long as it remains exiled, and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any color to cast it.


* You must follow the normal timing permissions and restrictions for the exiled card. If it's a land, you can't play it unless you have land plays available.
* You'll still pay all costs for a spell cast this way, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs if any are available.
* If you play a card this way, it leaves exile and becomes a new object. If it returns to exile later in the turn, you can't play it again.

Artifact  

{T}: Add {R}.  

As Cursed Mirror enters the battlefield, you may have it become a copy of any creature on the battlefield until end of turn, except it has haste.


* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Cursed Mirror enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
* While it is copying a creature, Cursed Mirror does not have "{T}: Add {R}" (unless the creature it's copying also has that ability).
* If something else becomes a copy of Cursed Mirror while Cursed Mirror is a copy of a creature, the duration of the effect is not copied. The new copy will still be a creature (with haste) after Cursed Mirror stops being a copy at the end of the turn.
* Cursed Mirror copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its types, color, power and toughness, and so on.
* If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If the copied creature is copying something else, then Cursed Mirror enters the battlefield as a copy of whatever that creature is copying.
* If the copied creature is a token, Cursed Mirror copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. Copying a token doesn't make Cursed Mirror a token. Similarly, if Cursed Mirror itself is a token, copying a nontoken permanent doesn't make it stop being a token.
* If Cursed Mirror somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as a creature, it can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.

Whenever Dazzling Sphinx deals combat damage to a player, that player exiles cards from the top of their library until they exile an instant or sorcery card. You may cast that card without paying its mana cost. Then that player puts the exiled cards that weren't cast this way on the bottom of their library in a random order.


* Dazzling Sphinx's triggered ability lets you cast the exiled card during the resolution of the ability. It doesn't allow you to wait and cast the card later.
* You may choose not to cast the instant or sorcery card that you exiled. In that case, it will be put on the bottom of the library with the rest of the exiled cards.
* If the exiled instant or sorcery card has an {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of {X}.

Whenever you cast an artifact spell, you may pay {2}. If you do, create a 0/0 colorless Construct artifact creature token with "This creature gets +1/+1 for each artifact you control."

Whenever you cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, put two charge counters on Elementalist's Palette.  

{T}: Add one mana of any color.  

{T}: Add {C} for each charge counter on Elementalist's Palette. Spend this mana only on costs that contain {X}.


* If you cast a spell with multiple {X} mana symbols in its cost, the first ability triggers only once.
* The mana added by the last ability can be used only to pay costs with at least one {X}, but it can be used to pay for any part of that cost, not just the {X}. That {X} could be in a spell's total cost, an ability's activation cost, or a cost you're asked to pay as a spell or ability resolves.
* The mana added by the last ability doesn't all have to spent on the same cost.

4/4  

Flying  

The first time you would create one or more tokens during each of your turns, you may instead choose a creature other than Esix, Fractal Bloom and create that many tokens that are copies of that creature.


* This effect applies before anything that modifies how those tokens enter the battlefield.
* This effect can apply to any token, not just creature tokens. For example, you could replace creating a Treasure token with creating a copy of the chosen creature.
* If you choose a legendary creature, the copies will also be legendary. If this results in you controlling more than one legendary permanent with the same name, you'll put all but one of them into their owner's graveyard.
* If you choose not to apply the replacement effect, you will not get the choice to apply it again until your next turn.
* If you create one or more tokens during your turn, and then Esix comes under your control, the replacement effect won't apply to any tokens you create the rest of the turn. You'll have to wait until your next turn.

Reach  

Creature spells you cast cost {X} less to cast, where X is the amount of life you gained this turn.  

{T}: You gain 2 life.


* Ezzaroot Channeler's second ability counts the total amount of life gained without considering any life you lost during that turn. For example, if you lost 3 life and gained 4 life earlier in the turn, creature spells you cast will cost {4} less.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Ezzaroot Channeler's second ability). The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
* The second ability's cost reduction can reduce only generic mana in a spell's total cost. It can't reduce colored mana requirements.

Mentor *(Whenever this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on target attacking creature with lesser power.)*  

Whenever a nontoken creature you control dies, if it had counters on it, create X tapped 2/1 white and black Inkling creature tokens with flying, where X is the number of counters it had on it.


* The last ability counts the number of all kinds of counters, not just +1/+1 counters.
* Mentor compares the power of the creature with mentor with that of the target creature at two different times: once as the triggered ability is put onto the stack, and once as the triggered ability resolves. If you wish to raise a creature's power so its mentor ability can target a bigger creature, the last chance you have to do so is during the beginning of combat step.
* If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
* If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.

Storm *(When you cast this spell, copy it for each spell cast before it this turn.)*


* Each copy you create because of storm will cause your magecraft abilities to trigger.
* Each copy will resolve one at a time. As each copy resolves, if you discarded a nonland card, the reflexive triggered ability triggers and you pick a target to be dealt damage. That ability will resolve before you deal with the next copy of Fiery Encore.
* If you have no cards in hand as Fiery Encore resolves, you won't be able to discard a card, but you will draw a card. No damage will be dealt.

Equip {2}


* To double the number of +1/+1 counters on a permanent, put a number of +1/+1 counters on it equal to the number it already has. Other cards that interact with putting counters on it will interact with this effect accordingly.
* If you put Fractal Harness onto the battlefield without casting it, or if you choose 0 as the value of X, the token you create will be 0/0. Unless something else is raising its toughness, that token will enter the battlefield and die before you could take any actions.

As Guardian Archon enters the battlefield, secretly choose an opponent.  

Reveal the player you chose: You and target permanent you control each gain protection from the chosen player until end of turn. Activate only once.


* In a two-player game, the chosen player won't be much of a secret.
* There are several ways to secretly choose an opponent. Perhaps the most popular way is to write the chosen player's name on a piece of paper that is kept with Guardian Archon.
* If you control more than one Guardian Archon, you may choose a different opponent for each one. Be careful to keep track of which opponent is chosen for each Guardian Archon.
* If Guardian Archon leaves the battlefield and returns, it's considered a new object. You may choose a new opponent and you may activate its last ability again.
* If you didn't choose an opponent as Guardian Archon entered the battlefield, you can't pay the cost to activate the last ability. This will usually happen because you gained control of another player's Guardian Archon or because a creature already on the battlefield became a copy of Guardian Archon.
* Protection from a player means all of the following: (1) Neither you nor the target permanent can be the target of spells or abilities controlled by the chosen player. (2) Neither you nor the target permanent can be enchanted or equipped by any Auras or Equipment controlled by the chosen players. (Okay, Fortifications too, if the target permanent is a land.) (3) If the target permanent is a creature, it can't be blocked by creatures controlled by the chosen player. (4) All damage that would be dealt to you or the target permanent by sources controlled by the chosen player is prevented. The same is true for sources owned by the chosen player that don't have controllers.

* You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Revel in Silence's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
* Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
* If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
* When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
* If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
* As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
* If you can't cast the card for any reason, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.

* Nothing special happens on the third spell, fourth spell, and so on.
* The ability can trigger once each turn for each opponent.
* It doesn't matter if Monologue Tax was on the battlefield for the first spell. It also doesn't matter if that first spell resolved or not.

Exile the top X cards of your library. You may cast an instant or sorcery spell with mana value X or less from among them without paying its mana cost. Then put the exiled instant and sorcery cards that weren't cast this way into your hand and the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.


* If you cast a spell with {X} in its cost without paying its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X.
* You don't have to cast an instant or sorcery spell this way. If you don't, all exiled instant or sorcery cards will be put into your hand.

At the beginning of your end step, for each player, put a +1/+1 counter on up to one target creature that player controls.  

Each creature with one or more counters on it can't attack you or planeswalkers you control unless its controller pays {X}, where X is the number of counters on that creature.


* For each player, choosing a target creature that player controls is optional.
* All counters on a creature are considered when determining the value of X, not only +1/+1 counters.
* Your opponents can choose not to pay to attack with a creature with one or more counters on it that attacks "if able." If there's no other player or planeswalker to attack, the creature simply doesn't attack.

Sorcery  

Exile all creatures. Each player creates a 0/0 green and blue Fractal creature token and puts a number of +1/+1 counters on it equal to the total power of creatures they controlled that were exiled this way.


* Oversimplify counts the total power of the creatures as they last existed on the battlefield, not the power of those cards in exile.
* If a commander is exiled this way, its power will be counted along with the other creatures. Once Oversimplify finishes resolving, that commander's owner may move it to the command zone.

Each player puts a vow counter on a creature they control and sacrifices the rest. Each of those creatures can't attack you or planeswalkers you control for as long as it has a vow counter on it.


* Each player, including you, must put a vow counter on a creature they control if able. They can't choose to opt out and sacrifice all of their creatures. The creature you put a vow counter on will remember its promise if another player gains control of it.
* If the vow counter is removed from the creature, it can attack as normal.
* If the vow counter is moved to another creature, it won't prevent the second creature from attacking normally.

Flash  

When Radiant Performer enters the battlefield, if you cast it from your hand, choose target spell or ability that targets only a single permanent or player. Copy that spell or ability for each other permanent or player the spell or ability could target. Each copy targets a different one of those permanents and players.


* You copy the spell or ability for every permanent or player it could target. That is, you don't choose either permanents or players and then make copies based on that.
* You can choose a spell or ability with multiple targets as long as all of those targets are the same permanent or player.
* You control all the copies, and you'll choose which copy targets which permanent or player. For example, if the original spell says, "Destroy target creature," you'll ultimately choose the order in which each creature targeted by a copy is destroyed. Remember that the original spell or ability will resolve after all of the copies.
* Each copy you create will cause your magecraft abilities to trigger.

Instant  

Counter target spell. You may cast a spell with an equal or lesser mana value from your hand without paying its mana cost.


* If a spell with {X} in its mana cost is countered this way, {X} is the value chosen as the spell was cast.
* This can be used to cast either face of a modal double-faced card, but only if the face you are casting has an equal or lesser mana value than the target spell.
* If you target a spell that can't be countered, like Heated Debate, you won't counter the spell, but you will get to cast a spell with an equal or lesser mana value.
* If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the spell you cast has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X.

Legendary Creature — Human Wizard

At the beginning of combat on your turn, create X tokens that are copies of another target creature you control, where X is one plus the number of instant and sorcery spells you've cast this turn. They gain haste. Exile them at the beginning of the next end step.


* The triggered ability counts all instants and sorceries that were cast before it resolves. If you cast instant spells in response to the ability, those spells will count.
* The tokens copy exactly what is printed on the creature and nothing else (unless that creature is a token or is copying something else; see below). They don't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If the copied creature is itself a token, the tokens created by Rionya copy the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it.
* If the copied creature is copying something else, the tokens enter the battlefield as whatever that creature is copying.
* If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the tokens enter the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.

Rousing Refrain  

{3}{R}{R}  

Sorcery  

Add {R} for each card in target opponent's hand. Until end of turn, you don't lose this mana as steps and phases end. Exile Rousing Refrain with three time counters on it.  

Suspend 3—{1}{R} *(Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {1}{R} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)*


* You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Revel in Silence's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
* Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
* If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
* If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
* When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
* If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
* As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
* If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.

Then, all players who chose to do so discard their hands and draw seven cards. Players later in the turn order will know if players before them are discarding, but they don't get to see what those players will discard to help them decide whether to discard themselves.

Ruxa, Patient Professor  

{2}{G}{G}  

Legendary Creature — Bear Druid  

4/4  

Whenever Ruxa, Patient Professor enters the battlefield or attacks, return target creature card with no abilities from your graveyard to your hand.  

Creatures you control with no abilities get +1/+1.  

You may have creatures you control with no abilities assign their combat damage as though they weren't blocked.


* A creature or creature card with no abilities is one with no rules text at all. This includes true vanilla creatures (including Grizzly Bears, Runeclaw Bear, Bear Cub, and other adorable bear students), face-down creatures, many tokens, and creatures that have lost their abilities. Abilities that function only in zones other than the battlefield count. For example, a creature with cycling {2} is not a creature with no abilities.
* Notably, neither of Ruxa's last two abilities give any creatures an ability.
* Auras and Equipment that grant abilities will use the words "gains" or "has," and they'll list a keyword ability or an ability in quotation marks. A creature with no abilities affected by such an Aura or Equipment would no longer get the +1/+1 bonus or be able to assign combat damage as though it weren't blocked. If the Aura or Equipment does not give the creature any abilities, the creature will continue to benefit from Ruxa's last two abilities.
* For each attacking creature you control with no abilities, you decide whether it will assign combat damage to the blocking creatures or if it will assign combat damage to the player or planeswalker it's attacking. You can't split damage assignment between them. You make this decision individually for each qualifying creature just before it deals combat damage.

When Scholarship Sponsor enters the battlefield, each player who controls fewer lands than the player who controls the most lands searches their library for a number of basic land cards less than or equal to the difference, puts those cards onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffles.


* For example, if you control four lands, one opponent controls six lands, and another opponent controls seven lands, you will search your library for up to three basic land cards and the first opponent will search their library for one basic land card. The second opponent won't search their library at all.

2/4  

{U}, {T}: Until your next turn, target creature an opponent controls can't be blocked. Goad that creature. *(Until your next turn, that creature attacks each combat if able and attacks a player other than you if able.)*


* Once a creature an opponent controls has been legally blocked, activating Sly Instigator's ability won't change or undo that block.
* If a goaded creature can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped or having come under that player's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
* If a goaded creature doesn't meet any of the above exceptions and can attack, it must attack a player other than a player who goaded it if able. It the creature can't attack any of those players but could otherwise attack, it must attack an opposing planeswalker (controlled by any opponent) or a player who goaded it.
* Attacking with a goaded creature doesn't cause it to stop being goaded.
* Being goaded more than once by the same player is redundant.
* If you goad a creature you control, it must attack, and it must attack a player rather than a planeswalker.
* If a creature you control has been goaded by multiple opponents, it must attack one of your opponents who hasn't goaded it. If a creature you control has been goaded by each of your opponents, you choose which opponent it attacks.
* If you leave the game, any creatures you've goaded remain goaded until your next turn would have begun. They don't immediately stop being goaded and don't remain goaded indefinitely.

This spell costs {X} less to cast, where X is the amount of life you gained this turn.  

Trample  

At the beginning of your end step, if you gained life this turn, you may cast Sproutback Trudge from your graveyard.


* Sproutback Trudge's ability counts the total amount of life gained without considering any life you lost during that turn. For example, if you lost 3 life and gained 4 life earlier in the turn, Sproutback Trudge will cost {3}{G}{G}.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Sproutback Trudge's first ability). Sproutback Trudge's mana value is always 9, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
* The cost reduction can reduce only generic mana in a spell's total cost. It can't reduce the cost to cast Sproutback Trudge beyond {G}{G}.
* You still need to pay the cost to cast Sproutback Trudge from your graveyard.
* You need to gain life before the end step begins for the last ability to trigger.

* Copying the card doesn't cause magecraft abilities to trigger, although casting the copies does.
* You cast the copies while the delayed triggered ability of Surge to Victory is resolving. Ignore any timing restrictions based on the copies' card types.
* If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the spell you cast has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X.

* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, a "whenever you gain life" ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability will trigger only once.

* Veyran's effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger again. Any choices you make as you put the ability on the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution are also made individually.
* If you somehow control two Veyrans (which would be poetic), you casting an instant or sorcery spell causes abilities to trigger three times. A third Veyran (less poetic) causes abilities to trigger four times, and so on.
