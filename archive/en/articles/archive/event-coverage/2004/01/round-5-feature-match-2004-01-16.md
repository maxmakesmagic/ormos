![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptams04/fm7_2.jpg)The judge putting up the names on the feature match board asked me who is who, which got a pretty funny response out of Krempels: "How embarrassing! Isn't it obvious who the obnoxious American is?"

The almost-friendly banter continued, as both players shuffled up.

Ostrovich- "Good luck to me"  
 Krempels- "You hear that? What a scumbag!"  
 Ostrovich- "I'm gonna need it."  
 Krempels- "My deck is good."  
 Ostrovich - "My deck is not so good."

Game 1-

Ostrovich had a first turn [Auriok Transfixer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer), and Krempels played [Slith Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Firewalker). A Scimitar made the Transfixer bigger, and Krempels took full control of the board, playing [Spikeshot Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) and [Glissa Sunseeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa+Sunseeker). [Vulshok Gauntlets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Gauntlets) were already out and went on the Transfixer, but they were destroyed in short order. Krempels made things even more ugly with a second Spikeshot, and Ostrovich tried to create a window of opportunity with [Blinding Beam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Beam), keeping Krempels' team tapped down for a turn. All he could was play [Yotian Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier) and Gauntlets, leaving him with one card in hand. Krempels played [Ogre Leadfoot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Leadfoot) and [Pyrite Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb), which was more than enough to get Ostrovich to concede.

Ostrovich- 0 Krempels- 1

Ostrovich sideboarded plenty of cards for Game 2, changing his deck around significantly.

Game 2-

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptams04/fm7_3.jpg)This time, Ostrovich opened with [Myr Retriever](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Retriever), and Krempels played [Silver Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr). Ostrovich summoned [Soldier Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica), and as Krempels tapped his mana Ostrovich mockingly asked for a [Spikeshot Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin), but got [Tel-Jilad Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Exile) instead. It attacked into [Soldier Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica), [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) took down the Retriever before combat, and [Battlegrowth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlegrowth) let it take down the Replica in combat. [Predator's Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%27s+Strike) did likewise for Ostrovich's [Yotian Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier). [Vulshok Gauntlets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Gauntlets) and [Titanium Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanium+Golem) gave Ostrovich a little defense, and [Taj-Nar Swordsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taj-Nar+Swordsmith) searched up [Scythe of the Wretched](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scythe+of+the+Wretched). Now, Ostrovich was able to go on the offensive, and still have a large creature on defense to protect him. This wouldn't last long, as Krempels' Exile was blocked by the Swordsmith holding the Scythe, and [Turn to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Dust) was cast before combat to make it a 2-for-1 exchange. [Pyrite Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) gave Krempels another potential answer, and it took down [Vedalken Archmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Archmage). Ostrovich's [Titanium Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanium+Golem) was still a solid resource, and it was chump blocked by a [Spikeshot Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin). [Skyhunter Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol) followed, and Ostrovich had enough mana left to give it the Gauntlets. It didn't matter, as Krempels had [Detonate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detonate) to win the match.

Ostrovich- 0 Krempels- 2
