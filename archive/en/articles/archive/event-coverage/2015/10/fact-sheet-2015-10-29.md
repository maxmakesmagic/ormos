Welcome back to Lyon!  
  

Three years after its last stop, the Grand Prix circuit is coming back to France’s third largest city.  

Within driving distance from Belgium, Germany, Italy and Switzerland, Lyon’s airport (LYS) is very well connected with direct flights to major European cities (Paris, Amsterdam, Rome, Madrid, Prague, Frankfurt, etc.)  
  

Our venue, the CCC, Centre de Congrès de Lyon, is located in the heart of this beautiful city, next to the Parc de la tête d’or.  

1800 seats will be reserved for the Grand Prix Main Event and we’ll have quite an extensive Side Events Program, also designed for all those who favor Constructed over limited with no less than 2 tournaments in each constructed format each day.  
  

Full details will be available on <http://gp-lyon-2015.bazaar-of-moxen.com>.  
  

We’re looking forward to welcoming you there!
