Yuta Takahashi is a man who needs little introduction, with a victory at Grand Prix Kyoto win just two months ago to accompany his eight Grand Prix Top 8s. His opponent, Bo Sun of China is no slouch either, and is currently the Pro Tour points leader in China.


At 6-1 each, this match will secure Day 2 for the winner, leaving the loser to a "win-and-in" bubble match for the final round. Takahashi is armed with TarmoTwin, while Sun came with mountains and burn spells at the ready.


Game 1
======


Winning the die roll, Sun quickly opened, guns blazing with a [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), netting Takahashi an extra land. With 9 cards in his hand, Takahashi mulled over what land to play and eventually decided on [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest). He had the option of fetching an Island to cast [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), but instead chose to pass and discard it instead.


That should've raised Sun's eyebrows, but with no second land in sight, he had to contend with adding [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) to his team. Sure enough, Takahashi fetched out a [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground) during Sun's end step, paving the way to a second turn [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), large enough to brawl with the [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) thanks to the [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) he discarded earlier.
