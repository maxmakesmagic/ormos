 Kurt Burgner (Game Empire) vs. Darwin Kastle (Your Move Games) |

 The Finals room | 
 A "Donais-eye-view" of the finals |
| 
 The dice to the right of the creatures are Goblin tokens that Darwin Kastle controls. He also controls a Field Surgeon; this game might never have ended. | 
 David Humpherys has just clinched the win for his team, Rob Dougherty having won five minutes earlier thanks to Brian Selden's Memory Jar (which gave Dougherty a Parch) |
| 
 The winning team congratulated each other; everyone else tries to congratulate them too. | 
 Jon Finkel presents Kai Budde, the 1998-99 Player of the Year with a ring to go with Budde's World Champion ring. |
