### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a513.jpg)Svend won the flip, but had to mulligan his first hand, which only had a [Mogg Flunkies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Flunkies) as a creature in it, and some burn. His second hand wasn't much better though, with a [Raging Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Goblin) and a [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) as only non-land cards. After that he got another hand with just a [Mogg Flunkies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Flunkies) but had to keep that to have a shot at winning this game. It left him without a turn one play and had to settle with [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), go.

Gabriel got a first turn [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) that got [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)ed by Svend, who drew and play [Goblin Lackey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Lackey) next turn. A [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) hit the board next turn on Gabriel's side, and when Svend attacked his Lackey summoned a [Mogg Flunkies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Flunkies). Another [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) on Gabriel's side and his [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) was now ready to do some blocking if needed. Svend peeled a [Raging Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Goblin), and thought if it was right to play it now. He had [Reckless Abandon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Abandon) and a [Volcanic Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer) in his hand as well, so he wouldn't be able to kill off the Treetop if he played the [Raging Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Goblin) now. He settled for just attacking with his Lackey and Flunkies, taking Gabriel down to 15, who wanted to cycle a [Krosan Tusker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker) to get a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp). It's used to play a [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) next turn. Svend on his turn plays his [Reckless Abandon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Abandon) on Gabriel, who activates his Deed during Svend's attack phase.

Svend replaces the Lackey and Gab replaces his [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) as well. He activates it for two on his turn though, clearing the board of Goblins. After this all that Svend does is play [Volcanic Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer) on Gabriel, who summons a [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger) and [Yavimaya Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder) over the following two turns to finish off Svend.

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a514.jpg)No mulligans this time and a [Goblin Cadets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Cadets) give Svend a pretty good start. Gab doesn't have an Elf or Bird, and [Mogg Flunkies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Flunkies) join the [Goblin Cadets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Cadets). In Svend's next attack step Gab plays a [Diabolic Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) on Svend who sacrifices his Flunkies to it. Two [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic)s hit the board next and they get wiped away by an [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) on Goblins from Gab. Just a [Seal of Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire) is next for Svend, who gets to face a [Ravenous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) on Gab's side. Svend himself answers that with a might 0/1 Piledriver and Gab just plays another Baloth after attacking. Svend plays another Piledriver but a second [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) on Goblins kills both of them off. From that point on the match was pretty much lost. Svend takes his time killing off the Baloths, but when a [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger) pops up on Gab's side he knows it's all over.
