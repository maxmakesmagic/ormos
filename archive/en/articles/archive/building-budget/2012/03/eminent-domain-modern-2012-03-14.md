Recently, many readers began asking me to build a Modern Turbo [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) deck. I tried a few different lists but was unimpressed with every iteration. The deck had an excellent Game 1 against a lot of different decks; after sideboarding, however, the deck couldn't buy a win.

I wanted to build a Modern deck with the same sentiment. Prison-style decks that plan on minimizing the opponent's ability to operate are a huge piece of **Magic**'s history, even if they're not really a part of modern magic. (Outside of Vintage and Legacy [STAX archetypes](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/deck/497).)

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab186_wild.jpg)[Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) | Art by [Carl Critchlow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Carl+Critchlow%22%5D)

Today, I'd like to introduce you to the deck that made me a competitive **Magic** player. Eminent Domain is, in my opinion, one of the most brilliantly conceived archetypes in the history of the game. After *Ninth Edition* was released, many of the world's best card analysts postured that [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) was the most powerful spell in Standard. Then we saw decklists, and no one was playing [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire). A bit of time passed and people forgot about "The best spell in Standard" and the card went seemingly ignored until [Adrian Sullivan](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Adrian%20Sullivan) decided to step outside of the box and design the first viable deck to include [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire).

Eminent Domain is a deck that focuses on controlling the opponent's resources. The deck is excellent at setting up perfect [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire)s. Cards like [Dream Leash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Leash) and [Annex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annex) ensure you'll find a turn where your opponent has four lands in play and you have six or more. At that point, [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) is essentially a [Cruel Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum). The deck protects itself with inexpensive removal spells while it sets up a big [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) turn. This deck has a very special place in my heart because with it I won Friday Night **Magic** every week for thirteen weeks in a row back in late 2005â€“early 2006.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab186_wildfire.jpg)  
Once you learn how to time your spells, the deck has an incredible matchup against both creature decks and control decks. Combo decks will give you some trouble, but if you're willing to invest in copies of [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) for the sideboard, you should be fine in Games 2 and 3 against them too.

Let me talk about the cards and why they're in the deck.

[Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) is an incredibly powerful spell currently overlooked in Modern because of its high casting cost. A lot of Modern decks rely heavily on mana creatures and [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) does an excellent job of locking down your opponent. After you cast a [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire), it is not uncommon for your opponent's next turn to consist of drawing a card and simply saying, "Go."

[Annex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annex) is [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire)'s best friend. This card produces an interesting kind of card advantage. This card is incredible against [Tron decks](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/deck/913) that seem to be some of the winning-est decks in the format. Against other strategies, [Annex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annex) helps you set up a brutal [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab186_ad.jpg)  
[Dream Leash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Leash) gives us redundancy with [Annex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annex). There are a lot of matchups where we're probably just stealing a land, but sometimes your opponent will have a massive [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) or [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and it becomes necessary to steal it over to your side of the table.

[Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) is a great reactive spell. [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) is probably better in this spot, but the *Ravnica* uncommon has become incredibly difficult to acquire lately. [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) still fulfills the same role in the deck and it's much easier to find. A deck with [Annex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annex), [Dream Leash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Leash), and [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) will be hard-pressed to find a time where [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) isn't just a ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)[Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell).

| Remand | Mana Leak |

Standard versions of Eminent Domain didn't have access to [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), but I'm sure they would have played it if they did. It's important to note that this is one of the decks where you probably don't want to cast your [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) on turn one unless you're missing a two-mana accelerator. I recommend holding the [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s until it becomes clear what exactly you need to find. The deck has answers to just about everything and it's worth waiting to find a perfect card because you'll have plenty of mana after the fourth turn anyway.

[Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) is very well positioned right now. Artifact aggro decks seem to be the flavor of the month in Modern and [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) punishes those decks pretty hard. [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) is also excellent against [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) and [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls).

[Repeal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) is an important one-of here. There are permanent types you'll have a lot of trouble dealing with; for example, if your opponent has a [Worship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship) in play it can become very difficult to end the game. The deck can lock an opponent out of the game pretty well, but the cleanup has to be messy sometimes. A single copy of [Repeal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) will let the deck win a lot of otherwise unwinnable games.



|  |  |

| Pyroclasm | Repeal |

[Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) is the most efficient spot-removal spell available to red players. You want to be using this on turn one or in conjunction with another spell on the same turn in order to spend your mana most effectively.

The original Eminent Domain deck won with [Kamigawa dragons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&format=+%5B&quot;Kamigawa+Block&quot;%5D&subtype=+%5B&quot;Dragon&quot;%5D). [Kokusho, the Evening Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star) and [Keiga, the Tide Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+the+Tide+Star) would usually come down after a [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) and clean up the game. These days, we have a significantly better win condition: [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan). Think about it: you cast [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) and destroy all of your opponent's lands and creatures. You pass the turn, your opponent plays a land and passes. You cast [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan) and tap the land your opponent played. 

![Frost Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Frost+Titan)  
Yes, that's a dream scenario, but it's going to happen more than you think. [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan)'s protection ability is close to hexproof when you're destroying and stealing your opponent's lands. [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan) also closes the game very quickly. Three attacks will usually be good enough, and because of *Ravnica* shocklands and fetchlands, you might be able to finish a game with two attacks and a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt).

[Mind Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Stone) and [Izzet Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Signet) provide the deck with necessary acceleration. I'd probably [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) to find one of these if I didn't have it in my opening hand, but it's not the end of the world when you have to spend the first couple turns playing removal spells and [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s.

[Mikokoro, Center of the Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mikokoro%2C+Center+of+the+Sea) works really well in a deck that controls its opponents' resources. Letting your opponents draw cards is fine when you have eight lands and they have one. You can use your cards much more effectively.

Here's the final sixty that I played a few games with the deck to see how it fared against the current Modern metagame.

As expected, Tron is a very easy matchup for the [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) deck. Tron needs to draw nearly perfectly to have a shot against you, and post-sideboard you can sideboard out your creature removal and bring in cards like [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) and [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab186_cran.jpg)I lost the roll and kept [Shivan Reef](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), [Dream Leash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Leash), and [Annex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annex). 

My opponent played a [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite), an [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), a [Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal), a [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel), and a [Steel Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer). I drew a [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan), played my [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and aimed a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) at [Steel Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer). My opponent played a [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) and attacked for 1. I drew an [Izzet Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Signet), played [Shivan Reef](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), and cast the Signet. My opponent equipped the [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) and attacked for 6. I drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), played it, and cast [Annex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annex) on my opponent's only land. My opponent attacked me for 5 and passed. 

I drew a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and cast it to find a [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm), [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan), and land. Then I cast [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) and passed the turn, leaving my opponent with a [Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) that doesn't produce mana and a [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating). My opponent played a [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel) and cast [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager). I drew a land and cast [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan), tapping down the [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager). My opponent cast [Steel Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer). 

I drew [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan), attacked with [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan), and cast another [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan). My opponent played a creature and passed. I drew a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), attacked with both Titans, and finished off my opponent off with the [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt).

The deck should also do well against creature decks that aren't on a [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) plan. [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) and [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) let you buy enough time to start casting your big spells.

You'll want to build a sideboard before you bring this deck to any tournament. Keep in mind the proper numbers for your sideboard. For example, you have four [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s and two [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm)s that are very weak against a lot of decks. Make sure you have exactly six cards in your sideboard that are good against those decks. Cards like [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) and [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) will fill this role perfectly. 

You'll need some cards against combo, and [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) and [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) won't be good enough. I recommend [Trinisphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere) or [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) right now, because it's something the [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) decks won't know how to deal with. The rest of your sideboard should probably be filled with cards like [Flame Slash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash), [Slagstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagstorm), [Shattering Spree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattering+Spree), and [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember). The numbers are malleable and the correct iteration will depend on your exact decklist and the metagame you expect. I've been thinking about writing a column on proper sideboard construction and I'd be interested to hear whether or not there's a demand for that.

Unfortunately, it's difficult to make the deck strong against combo strategies, but a healthy dose of interaction in the sideboard could help alleviate that issue. If you're expecting lots of creatures and control decks and not a lot of [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), then this is a great deck for the Modern metagame.

The entire deck is easy to acquire. [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan) is even easily available right now.

I'll probably play something along these lines in my next [Modern PTQ](/en/node/640181). I strongly recommend putting the deck together and taking it for a spin. It might be the most fun deck ever if you're into this sort of thing.

As always, hit the forums or shoot me an email with any questions, comments, or ideas for future columns.

Happy Brewing!
