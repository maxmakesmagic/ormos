*Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* is coming to *MTG Arena*! For our readers and preview seekers, we've created this handy guide to preview season. We even kicked things off today in our weekly [*MTG Arena* Announcements](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-announcements-june-22-2022), before *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* arrives on *MTG Arena* July 7.


Whether you want to follow or avoid the latest previews, this page will help you track everything coming by sharing where upcoming *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* previews are planned on each day.


Below, you'll find a list of dates as well as any outlets previewing a card on that date. After the previews are live, we'll update this article so that you can easily find them. If the link simply goes to the front of a website or social media site, that means they probably haven't previewed the card yet.


And if you just want to see all the cards that have been officially previewed in one place, you can always check out our Card Image Gallery. (We'll link the gallery here when it goes live.) Note that these galleries are updated every morning, Monday through Friday, so they contain all cards previewed the previous day (and earlier), but not the day of.


For the most up-to-date listings, bookmark this page and check back regularly for all the latest previews from *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate*!
