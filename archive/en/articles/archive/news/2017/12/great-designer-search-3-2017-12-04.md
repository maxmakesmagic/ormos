To celebrate *Magic*'s 25th anniversary, we're pulling out all the stops to bring back exciting things from *Magic*'s past. Today, we're happy to announce the return of yet another fan favoriteâ€”the *Great Designer Search*. This is an online contest where participants compete to earn a six-month internship position as a *Magic* designer.


For the full details, please check out the *Great Designer Search* *3* [Terms and Conditions](https://magic.wizards.com/gds3/terms-and-conditions). But we want to give you an overview of how it's going to work. Starting today through January 15, 2018, qualified candidates can [sign up](https://magic.wizards.com/gds3/sign-up). Then on January 16, 2018, we will send you ten essay questions to be answered, each question requiring 250 to 350 words. You will have a week to return the essay questions. You will then be invited to take a multiple-choice test on Friday, January 26, 2018. The top scorers of the multiple-choice test will be invited to take a design test. The top eight scorers of the design test will become contestants on the third *Great Designer Search*.


The *Great Designer Search* will have five *Magic* design challenges, one every other week. At the end of each challenge, one contestant will be eliminated. At the end of the five challenges, three contestants will remain. The final three contestants will be flown to the Wizards of the Coast office for a day-long event including a final live challenge. The winner will then be crowned and awarded the six-month internship position with Wizards.


To sign up to participate in the *Great Designer Search*, you must be a United States resident over the age of 18 and have fully read and agreed to *The Great Designer Search 3* [Terms and Conditions](https://magic.wizards.com/gds3/terms-and-conditions).
