Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






We started yesterday with over 650 players in the mortar and pestle that was Grand Prix: Shizuoka. It was reduced down to 64 players and we are now left with a fine paste of only eight. Those eight all have different levels of experience and notoriety and in the end only one of them can walk away with the title of Grand Prix Champion. 

More than in any other part of the world, Asian Grand Prix have a tendency to have Amateurs hoist the trophy. This Top 8 is an intriguing mix of the young and the--let's just say, not so young. Will an Amateur like Satoshi Harada steal away with the trophy or will one of the 20th Century Boys--Maki and Fujita--bring the trophy back for the old school?

Stay tuned for pick by pick coverage of the draft, deck building analysis, and of course the feature match coverage as we make our way to the close of this exciting weekend!
