 Known for his inventive constructed decks, Shota Yasooka came to Grand Prix Kobe equipped with a Blue-Black Tezzeret control deck. Similar to a deck that he played at Grand Prix Yokohama 2012, Yasooka hoped tear opponents hands apart with cards like [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) and [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), before landing his deck's namesake Planeswalker, [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas). Once in play, the Blue-Black planeswalker would generate Yasooka even more card advantage and allow him to turn his utility artifacts--[Darksteel Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel), [Talisman of Dominance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Dominance), [Dimir Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Signet), [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb)--into venerable 5/5 creatures.




 His opponent, Kazumasa Sato was playing the explosive but vulnerable Ad Nauseum combo deck. The Chiba native hoped to use the combination of Angel's Grace and Ad Nauseum to draw through his entire deck. With his deck in hand, he hoped to use [Simian Spirit Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide) to power a lethal flashbacked [Conflagrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conflagrate). The fragile combo deck had treated Sato well thus far, leading him into day two with only a single loss.



The Games



 Yasooka started game one off characteristically with an [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek).




 Sato revealed his hand of [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom), [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation), Ad Nauseum, [Boseiju, Who Shelters All](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boseiju%2C+Who+Shelters+All), [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand), and a couple of lands.




 Yasooka took the [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom), knowing that doing so would slow down Sato's combo considerably. On his fourth turn, Yasooka played a [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull).




 Sato, unphased by his lack of [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom), got down a [Pentad Prism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentad+Prism) and had access to five mana on his fifth turn. He showed patience, though, and played [Boseiju, Who Shelters All](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boseiju%2C+Who+Shelters+All), giving him the ability to combo off through any countermagic that Yasooka could have.




 Yasooka dropped Sato to 3 life after a pair of attacks with [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) and [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) and forced Sato to combo off or find an answer on his following turn.
