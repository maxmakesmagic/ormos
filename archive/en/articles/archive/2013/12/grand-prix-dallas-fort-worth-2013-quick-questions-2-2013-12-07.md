![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpdfw13/melissa_qh.jpg)***Pro Tour *Gatecrash* Quarterfinalist Melissa DeTora**: I think it's Last Breath. Everything you want to kill is two power or less.*

There's no other card that kills everything you want to kill early. The only card being played that Last Breath doesn't kill early is Fleecemane Lion, and that creature's able to be targeted by every other card.*
