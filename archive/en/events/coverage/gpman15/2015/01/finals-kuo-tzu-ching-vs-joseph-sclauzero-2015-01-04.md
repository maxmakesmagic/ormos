Ten Grand Prix Top 8s later, Tzu Ching Kuo finds himself at a bittersweet juncture. If his Abzan Midrange deck triumphs in this final match, he will attain his very first Grand Prix victory. It is rare that a player of his stature has not won a Grand Prix yet.


Prior to this weekend, he is tied with Eric Froehlich as the player with the most Grand Prix Top 8s without a win. If he loses this match, that would make 11 Grand Prix Top 8s without a win, bumping Froehlich to second. This is a statistic where you really don't exactly want to come in first place.


Joseph Sclauzero's achievements dwarf in comparison to the World *Magic* Cup Champion. But let's give him some credit. It's his very first Grand Prix and his very first Grand Prix Top 8, an impressive feat for a relative amateur. His Mardu Midrange deck was cooperating with him all weekend, as evidenced by his excellent topdecks and results.


As the day comes to a close, the tensest match of the evening will soon determine who goes home with the Champion trophy.


Game 1
======


  



Using [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) to tutor [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities), Kuo was forced to reveal it to his opponent because of the [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) in play. This discouraged Sclauzero from adding more creatures to the board.


Sclauzero pointed [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) at his opponent's life total and a second [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) to kill [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess). He certainly did not want Kuo tutoring up [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s.


![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=386666&type=card)


At a precarious 4 life, Kuo tread carefully. He decided to summon only [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) while keeping up three mana. This turned out to be a wise move, since the card lying at the top of Sclauzero's deck turned out to be [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker).


Thereafter, Kuo topdecked [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), bringing his life back to a safer range. Still, at 7 life, Kuo could still fall if he wasn't careful. Sclauzero utilized [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom) to deal with [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and bring Kuo down to 5 life, before chaining [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) to the rocks.


The battlefield was reduced to nothing but land, and both players were clearly operating on topdeck mode.


Sclauzero's [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) (ignoring Raid) would end the game in just two turns, and Kuo had to budge. [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) was not a solution and Kuo would need to peel something else to stay alive. Thankfully for Kuo, [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End) showed up in time to exile [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc), while [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) snuffed out [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster).


Sclauzero's next card [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) might seem innocuous, but this made [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) a "live topdeck", in addition to [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom), [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) and [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker). Kuo's position was precarious indeed, but [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) was about to go ultimate if he managed to survive one more turn.


"Do you win?", Kuo asked.


Sclauzero revealed [Temple of Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Silence) from the top of his deck, turning Kuo's question into a rhetoric.

Game 2
======


Sclauzero drew first blood with [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster), but Kuo wiped the pair of Goblins away with [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow). [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) was the replacement to keep up the pressure, even though it wasn't very much.


Kuo used the breathing room to summon [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) (revealing [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)). Sclauzero made the decision to exile the centaur with [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End), since it was the only creature which could pressure his Planeswalker this turn.


As expected, [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) entered the battlefield and that was destroyed with [Murder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murder)ous Cut. Sclauzero's [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) forced Kuo to summon [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion). Using her second ability, the demon hit the bin but she had to fall to the existing Vampire token.


Now that Sorin was getting out of hand, Kuo used [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) to find [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall). It was finished off by a freshly peeled [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) and Kuo was forced to expend another [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), the final bullet in his chamber.


The grindy attrition war eventually boiled down to who could topdeck better, apparently. Despite having [Read the Bones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones), Kuo's opponent was the one with the more relevant card. I've heard that [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) can end games quickly on her own.

**Tzu Ching Kuo 1 – Joseph Sclauzero 1**


Game 3
======


One last game. One last shot. One winner. Off we go...


Both players put down Scrylands on their first turn, and I don't think Kuo was very happy when he cast [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize).


Sclauzero's hand consisted [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster), [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst), [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End), [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) and two lands which gave Sclauzero all his three colors. While Kuo's grip of double [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) was not too shabby, it seemed to be slightly weaker in comparison.


Not wanting to risk a premature death, Kuo opted to pitch [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) this time and used a second copy of [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) to extract [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst). [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) was Kuo's solution to [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde).


When Kuo made a token with [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor), Sclauzero dealt with both permanents with another freshly drawn [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom). [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) and [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) created four tokens, only to be held back by Kuo's [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). That was quickly dealt with by the [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) we saw at the beginning of the game.


![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=386560&type=card)


The Goblins whittled away at Kuo's life totals. It seemed like the horde of angry men would get there slowly, but surely. In a last-ditch attempt to draw something relevant, Kuo's [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) brought him down to a single life. [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) would not do the trick. Kuo knew that Sclauzero's last card in hand was the [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End).
