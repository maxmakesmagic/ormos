Both players are nervous and a deck check deal of 8 minutes doesn't help. The judges come back and inform Tristan that he has failed to de-sideboard and has received a game loss. A tough way to win the right to go first.

Kissajukian 1 Gall 0

### Game 2

Tristan opens, his red green deck racing out of the blocks with A [Goblin Sledder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder) followed by a [Wellwisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher), Sam countering with an [Glory Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker). The sledder continues the assault with the help of the [Goblin Burrows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Burrows) trading with the Seeker, Tristan knows that his deck must push for early tempo to win. A second Glory seeker hits the table on Sam's side but this time it's not big enough to dictate terms with Tristan finding an [Elvish Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior).

Sam thinks he can out-race by enchanting his [Glory Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) with [Improvised Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Improvised+Armor) making it a 4/7. They trade beats as a goblin raider is enhanced by a second [Goblin Burrows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Burrows). Sam continued to push with a [Severed Legion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion), a morph creature, a Nightglove Courier and a [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk). .Down to only 5 life, with the 5/2 goblin flier swinging, Sam morphed the healer into play leaving himself at 1 life.   
 With Tristan on 11 life he made his play....

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmel02/a874.jpg)He cast a Festering goblin, which Tristan asked to responded to with the [Wellwisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) putting him on 13 life. He then activated the courier (targeting the husk) and declared an alpha strike, doing 12 points of damage. The [Wellwisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) responding to the goblin proved to be the game as the goblin swung for lethal next turn.

1 game all.

### Game 3

Sam opens with a [Wretched Anurid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid), Tristan replying with an [Elvish Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior). The [Severed Legion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) that threatened to cause so much damage last time, hit the table in a timely 3rd turns. Taking early damage Gall cast a [Skirk Commando](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando) face up, putting a [Crown of Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Fury) on it, This combined with a [Goblin Burrows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Burrows) and a [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) meant the Commando could not be taken down in combat and was always taking a creature a turn. Daru Sentinel, [Daunting Defender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender), even a [Silent Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Specter) fell as Tristan went on to victory securing a place in the top 8 finals.

**Final Result:** Gall 2 - Kissajukian 1
