**Did any particular card surprise you this weekend?**

This is not an *Ixalan* card but the Japanese community said that my 9-0 photo looked like [Hooting Mandrills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hooting+Mandrills). (Editor's Note: At Saitoâ€™s suggestion, we created a visual for your viewing pleasure.)
