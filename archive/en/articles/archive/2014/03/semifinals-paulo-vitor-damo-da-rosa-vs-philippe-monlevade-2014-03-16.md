 Brazil has always been the dominant force in South American **Magic**, and it has always had a particular stranglehold on events in Buenos Aires. This Semifinal match between Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, from Porto Allegre, and Phillipe Monlevade. from Rio de Janeiro, ensures that, once again, there will be a Brazilian player vying for the title of Grand Prix Buenos Aires Champion.




**The Decks**




 Damo da Rosa opted to play his trusty standby, Esper Control, and has had a very impressive run with the deck. He had praised the strength of [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) prior to beginning this Semifinal match, and it was very likely that it would come into play in a major way.
