Hello, everyone!


Theros's underworld isn't quite a revolving-door afterlife, but there are some ways to escape that the particularly clever deceased can use. For example, I brought a rubber toy full of peanut butter for the Cerberus. Who's a good doggy? Yes you are! It was all worth it because I got these really cool European dice from down there. I think I'm supposed to give them to some orphans.


Now that I'm back, I've got a fairly short rules update, most of which applies to Theros. One big batch applies to the original *Theros*, not *Theros Beyond Death*, but that still counts, right?


As usual, you'll be able to find the [Comprehensive Rules here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) on our website and Oracle text updated in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/)â€”at this time, one or both of those might not be updated just yet, so I'm describing a general truth here. Keep in mind that this article was written before the rules changes were finalized in editing, so there may be minor deviations from what I describe below.
