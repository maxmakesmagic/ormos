The Sideboard asked a few questions to ten of the players here this weekend at Grand Prix Detroit. *(Note that we asked these questions during the middle of day 1, less than three rounds into the tournament).*


### Question 1: Based on previous performance and skill, who do you think has the best chance to win Grand Prix Detroit? You are not allowed to pick yourself.


* **Matt Vienneau** - "I think Chris Benafel will win!"
* **Dan O'Mahoney-Schwartz** - "Chris Benafel, all the way."
* **Gary Wise** - "I would have to pick either William Jensen, Chris Benafel or Mike Turian."
* **Mike Turian** - "I think Dan OMS will win, he seems to do better when his brother Steve isn't at the tournament."
* **Dan Clegg** - "Either Baby Huey (William Jensen) or Brock Parker."
* **Beth Liston** - "I don't really know anyone who would win a Grand Prix!"
* **Nate Heiss** - "Since Finkel isn't here, I will guess Matt Vienneau."
* **Alex Shvartsman** - "Mikey P. will win!"
* **Joe "Mouth" Kambourakis** - "I don't really have a favorite for this tournament."
* **Rob Dougherty** - "I will pick Mike Pustilnik to win."

### Question 2: What is your favorite Grand Prix format?


* **Matt Vienneau** - "Rochester Draft"
* **Dan O'Mahoney-Schwartz** - "Rochester Draft"
* **Gary Wise** - "I've seen Apocalypse, so I would have to say Invasion, Planeshift Apocalypse Rochester Draft."
* **Mike Turian** - "Tempest Block Booster Draft. Rochester Draft is too slow and boring."
* **Dan Clegg** - "An all draft Tempest Block Grand Prix without Sealed Deck."
* **Beth Liston** - "Booster Draft."
* **Nate Heiss** - "Extended!"
* **Alex Shvartsman** - "Rochester."
* **Joe "Mouth" Kambourakis** - "5-color!"
* **Rob Dougherty** - "Team format is definitely my favorite."

### Question 3: If you make day two of this Grand Prix, what colors do you intend to draft?


* **Matt Vienneau** - "I'm not sure, but if white/green comes my way, I'll end up playing it."
* **Dan O'Mahoney-Schwartz** - "I will preferably draft blue/black/red, but I will draf anything if it I have to."
* **Gary Wise** - "Either red/black or red/green with a splash of black."
* **Mike Turian** - "Black/red/blue, but my second plan is to go mainly red/green. Many people think I'm nuts for playing those, but they are way strong.
* **Dan Clegg** - "White/blue or black/red."
* **Beth Liston** - "Blue/black/red."
* **Nate Heiss** - "Blue/black/red."
* **Alex Shvartsman** - "Green/white, it's really underdrafted."
