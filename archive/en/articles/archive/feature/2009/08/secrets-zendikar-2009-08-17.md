### Ruins of a Lost Civilization


Ancient, rune-carved monoliths called hedrons are strewn across Zendikar, the largest up to ten miles long. Some of these stones drift in the sky; others are buried in the ground, some whole, some broken. They're remnants of lost civilization, but their original purpose is unknown. This ancient empire wielded unimaginable power—enough to suspend gravity and alter the land to suit its purposes. Trap-riddled ruins can be found on every continent. Mysterious glyphs hint at truths long forgotten. Unspeakable monsters lurk in these hidden monuments of a forgotten past. These ruins still emanate power, and both planeswalkers and local explorers will undergo great peril to reap their rewards.

### Exploring the Wilds


Zendikar's intense mana and unique treasures inspires dreams of wealth and power in the bold and adventurous. Driven by tales of wondrous places of mystic power, bands of explorers venture into the wilds of Zendikar. Many such expeditions fail, overwhelmed by the world's many dangers. But a handful of elite, daring souls accomplish feats of discovery that have earned them riches and renown. Guides, porters, cartographers, sell-swords, lullmages, ruin-sages, and healers form expeditionary parties and team up to scour the world for treasure.

### Allies and Expeditionary Houses


Zendikar's hostile environment cultivates a sense of teamwork among its inhabitants, particularly for those who are intent on exploring the world. Expeditionary Houses—combination guild, hostel, and equipment shop—thrive on every continent. Anyone can pay to become aligned with a particular Expeditionary House, and notorious rivalries have developed between various houses. These are places where explorers meet to form adventuring parties, hear rumors, and hire out for expeditions.
