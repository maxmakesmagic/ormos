The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on August 25, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by changes. As mentioned yesterday, there are design changes coming to DailyMTG later today. For some parts of the world, that means tomorrow morning. Time zones are weird. Either way, things are about to get more readable up in here.


Today's Must
============


1. [Slowrolling Isn't Bad Manners—It's Good *Magic*](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/slowrolling-isnt-bad-manners-its-good-magic/) | ChannelFireball | Owen Turtenwald

This one set the internet on fire for a bit. Technically posted late yesterday, this is still very much worth a read if you haven't already. Not only is it an interesting angle on playing things out at the pro level (and one I very much appreciate as someone partially responsible for coverage), but it's an interesting look inside the thought process of the No. 1 player in the world.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Conspiracy: Take the Release Notes](http://judgecast.com/?p=1001) | JudgeCast | CJ Shrader, Bryan Prillaman, and Jess Dunks

Judges talk about the release notes for *Conspiracy: Take the Crown*. What more could you want out of a judge podcast this week?


1. [Against the Odds: Deploy the Gatewatch](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-deploy-the-gatewatch) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

Another entrant into the "had to happen eventually" slot, but that doesn't make this any less pleasant or interesting to watch. Especially since, unlike most Against the Odds, this deck does—*gasp*—well.


1. [World Championship Preview](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-video-episode-187-world-championships-preview/) | Magic the Amateuring | Maria Bartholdi and Meghan Wolff

Joined by special guest Erin Campbell of The Girlfriend Bracket, Maria and Meghan look ahead to the *Magic* World Championship next week. Also, maybe come up with a plan that would kill off tournament players in a terrifying gladiatorial-style mashup. That one probably isn't going to happen.


1. [Modern Flashback Series: *Worldwake*](http://puremtgo.com/articles/modern-flashback-series-worldwake) | PureMTGO | Vincent Borchardt

Get hyped for *Worldwake* on *Magic Online* Modern Flashback drafts with this primer from Vincent Borchardt. *Worldwake* is one of the game's most powerful sets, and it's a blast to boot. Definitely worth checking out. The draft, I mean. But also this article. Both are great.


1. [*Eldritch Moon* Sealed Deck](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-351-eldritch-moon-sealed-deck/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

Sure, everyone's looking at Modern and *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* this weekend, but if you're itching for a bit of *Eldritch Moon* Limited, Marshall and Luis have just the guide for you. Remember—Sealed Leagues are ongoing (and awesome) on *Magic Online*.


1. [Did You Know *Magic*: Dredge](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/didyouknowmagic-08252016-did-you-know-magic-dredge/) | Gathering Magic | Erin Campbell and Richard Castle

This is a pretty cool feature. It's everything you could basically ever want to know about dredge—the mechanic and the deck—in one package. We've got the basics, we've got videos from various content producers, tournament coverage, and more. If playing out of your graveyard is something that tickles your fancy, well then, first, you're why we can't have nice things. But second, you should check out this article.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [*Kaladesh* will not feature any returning mechanics—EVERY MECHANIC IS NEW!](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4zh2lz/kaladesh_will_not_feature_any_returning_mechanics/)

The title is a bit misleading, because of course there will be creatures with flying in *Kaladesh*. But what this thread that blew up overnight is referring to is that Mark Rosewater, design grand pooh-bah, wrote in his blog that "[You haven't seen any of the (named) *Kaladesh* mechanics before](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/149447709733/in-an-effort-to-make-this-speculation-season-more#notes)." Of course, what he meant (and later [clarified in another blog post](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/149451117248/if-we-havent-seen-any-named-mechanics-in-kaladesh#notes)) was that none of the named mechanics the set is built around are returning mechanics. So, think how madness returned in *Shadows over Innistrad* and was a major theme of the set. *Kaladesh* isn't doing that.


All good? Confusion abated? Excellent. Moving on.

Don't be surprised to see a lot of these kinds of tweets coming up. We've got two big things going on over the next two weeks. First up is a three–Grand Prix weekend headlined by video coverage from ChannelFireball at Grand Prix Indianapolis. The following week, however, is the big one—the *Magic* World Championship, running Thursday through Sunday at PAX West. You can check out more on [the competitors and the tournament here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/2016-magic-world-championship-next-week-2016-08-25).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Allosaurus Elf Combo](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33537_Video-Allosaurus-Elves-In-Modern.html)

I'm going to do something a little bit different today and *not* post a deck. That seems to make very little sense in the section called "Deck of the Day," but hear me out. I heard whispers of this deck yesterday and planned to search for it for today's update when, lo and behold, Shaun McLaren posted it on StarCityGames.com (and it was his deck that was the source of said whispers). Since I don't want to step on Shaun's toes and post a deck that's in an article posted this very day, I'm just going to tell you to [go there now](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33537_Video-Allosaurus-Elves-In-Modern.html). Seriously, people have been talking about [Eldritch Evolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldritch+Evolution) and [Allosaurus Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Allosaurus+Rider) since [Eldritch Evolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldritch+Evolution) was previewed, and McLaren may have actually gotten there. Check out [his list on StarCityGames.com](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33537_Video-Allosaurus-Elves-In-Modern.html).
