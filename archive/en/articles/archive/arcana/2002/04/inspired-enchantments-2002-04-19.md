As you all know, cards are often designed using inspiration drawn from previous cards. *Urza's Destiny* contains two cycles of cards that were inspired by *Tempest* cards. The first cycle was inspired by [Lobotomy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lobotomy), and included [Eradicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eradicate), [Quash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quash), [Scour](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scour), [Splinter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter), and [Sowing Salt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sowing+Salt).

The second cycle were the creature enchantments [Incendiary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incendiary), [Momentum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentum), [Archery Training](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archery+Training), [Private Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Private+Research), and [Festering Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Wound). Which *Tempest* card inspired them? Answer below.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The answer is [Legacy's Allure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legacy%27s+Allure), which featured a "growing" mechanic that was used throughout the *Urza's* block.
