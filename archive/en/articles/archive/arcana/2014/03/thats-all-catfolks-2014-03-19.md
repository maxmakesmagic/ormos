Brimaz, King of Oreskos | Art by [Peter Mohrbacher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Peter+Mohrbacher%22%5D)


I've featured Brimaz a couple times on Card of the Day, once as a preview card and once as part of a theme (**spoilers:** Cats who make more Cats). Let's start there and then look at Brimaz, leonin in general, and a certain white-mana Planeswalker. Sound like fun? I hope so!


For *Born of the Gods* previews, I wrote this about Brimaz: "Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas [suggests a couple decks](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/td/282) to guide your use of Brimaz." Not the most exciting write-up ever, but I definitely recommend LSV's still-relevant preview article.


The second time I wrote about Brimaz was a little meatier: "We know from the '[Planeswalker's Guide to *Theros*, Part 3](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/263c),' that Oreskos is the central domain of the leonin, who are slowly reverting to their original culture and abandoning that which was imposed on them by humans." If you like the stories of the planes and want to know more about the names of people, places, and things that appear on cards, I highly recommend the Planeswalker's Guides.


Now that we're all up to speed, let's have some new information!


Like, say, the art description:



> 
> Color: White Legendary creature  
> 
> Location: Outside Tethmos, the Leonin capital.—Think Scottish highlands.  
> 
> Action: Show us Brimaz, the leonin king who is both a warrior and spiritual leader of his people. He looks like he has seen his fair share of battle and bears a few scars (none over the eye, please). Brimaz should look in his late 40s—how this looks on a leonin is up to you. Take a look at the leonin [in] the world guide, but give Brimaz some unique costuming that befits his royal title. Maybe he has a unique ancestral sword/weapon. Make his coloring brown tones to black—our Planeswalker Ajani is white.  
> 
> Focus: Brimaz, the king.  
> 
> Mood: Noble, strong, wise.
> 
>

There are two segues here, but let's start with the Oreskos one:

Oreskos Sun Guide | Art by [Mathia Kollros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Mathias+Kollros%22%5D)


And the art description:



> 
> Color: White creature  
> 
> Action: Show a leonin monk who is in a ready-for-battle pose in a field. Maybe the monk has a cool-looking staff-spear. **Magic**al lines of golden white energy are weaving about the monk, maybe even some are entering his body.  
> 
> Focus: The leonin monk.  
> 
> Mood: He may be a healer of his people but don't piss him off.
> 
> 
> 


And for a reminder, here are their respective cards:

The other segue comes from Brimaz's art description, where it says "bears a few scars (none over the eye, please)." If you were wondering about that, here's what it's referencing:


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1453_cardart_ajaniccallerofthepride.jpg)
Ajani, Caller of the Pride | Art by [D. Alexander Gregory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22D.+Alexander+Gregory%22%5D)


One of Ajani's signature features is the scar over his left eye, which is referenced in the art of Ajani's Chosen. Going back in time a bit again, here is what I wrote about for that card: "It might be hard to see at card size, but these three cat soldiers are paying homage to their albino Planeswalker leader. From the art description: 'Each of them has a symbolic mark of face paint that slashes down over their left eye, that mimics Ajani's eye scar.'" This being an Arcana, I have the room to expand on that by showing the art at a larger size:

Ajani's Chosen | Art by [Wayne Reynolds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Wayne+Reynolds%22%5D)


Ajani's Chosen was painted by Wayne Reynolds, who also painted Ajani Vengeant. Here they are as cards, side by side:

And that wraps up our look at some of the coolest white-mana catfolk in **Magic**. I hope you enjoyed it!


As a side note, I want to thank our graphic artist, Bonnie, for helping me by assembling the images we need for these kinds of art-based Arcanas, and for our producer, John, for coding them. Thanks team! :)
