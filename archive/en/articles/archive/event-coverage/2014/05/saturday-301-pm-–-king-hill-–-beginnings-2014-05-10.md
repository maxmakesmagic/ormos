Every journey has to start somewhere, and here at Grand Prix Minneapolis, it begins in the Feature Match area. Here at this Modern Grand Prix, flush with over 1600 players, we couldn't have asked for a better King to begin the procession than the Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* Champion, and Modern master, Shaun McLaren. Playing in his first major event since his Pro Tour win, McLaren has had a great year of *Magic*, finishing in 25th place at Pro Tour *Theros* in addition to his win in Valencia. While it obviously took all-around talent to win the Pro Tour, McLaren is, above all else, a Modern specialist, one of the few players in the game today that can lay claim to that title. He is one of the easy favorites to win any Modern tournament he enters, and is an easy choice to be our inaugural King of the Hill here at Grand Prix Minneapolis.


McLaren's first challenge in the tournament is Sean Ryder, who has brought UWR Twin to Minneapolis this weekend. This is a deck that McLaren is incredibly familiar with, having defeated Tim Rivera's version of the deck in a close three-game match in the Quarterfinals of Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*. The deck apparently made an impact on McLaren, as it is his weapon of choice for this weekend as well.
