The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 21, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by Greece. I knew there was a reason I picked it for my honeymoon.


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [World *Magic* Cup Top 5 Moments](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2016WMC/top-5-moments-2016-11-20) | Wizards of the Coast | Event Coverage Staff

Congratulations to Greece!


There's so much we could highlight from the World *Magic* Cup, but we'll let the people who were there digest it down to just the top five. But if you want to deep dive into a momentous weekend, you can check out the [full coverage here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2016WMC) or watch the full broadcast on the [Twitch archives](https://www.twitch.tv/magic/v/102244553).


For my money, I'd also check out the "Going for Gold" series on previous champions [France](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2016wmc/going-for-gold-again-team-france-2016-11-18), [Denmark](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2016wmc/going-for-gold-again-team-denmark-2016-11-18), and [Italy](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2016wmc/going-gold-again-team-italy-2016-11-18).


1. [StarCityGames.com Open: Knoxville](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/191116_knoxville.html)

Talk about a called shot. Last week, Brad Nelson published an article titled "[Should I play B/G Delirium?](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34065_Should-I-Play-BG-Delirium.html)" (Premium subscription required) that said, essentially, that he needed to win this particular tournament and that he was contemplating Black-Green Delirium as his weapon of choice. He went with the deck and, by the end of Sunday, he spiked his one tournament. Check out [his deck below](#10) for more on Nelson's return to dominating Standard.


Oh, and you can also check out the replay of the event in the SCGLive [Twitch archives](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive/v/102275629).


1. [In Response: New EDH Cards, Esport Potential, and the Reserved List - A Magic The Gathering Debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gun9MM1LxU) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor and Josh Lee Kwai

This is something new and definitely different. As a fan of *SportsCenter* shows like *Pardon the Interruption* and *Around the Horn*, *In Response* appeals to me on a number of different levels. In this first episode, The Professor and Josh Lee Kwai discuss a number of *Magic* issues in a fast-paced, unique format that calls to mind some pretty great TV. Give the first episode a shot and we'll see where it goes from there.

The Wizards of the Coast Holiday Card
=====================================


1. Thopter Pie Network

Every holiday season, Wizards of the Coast creates a holiday-themed, not-tournament-legal, card as a special gift to vendors, partners, and other people we work closely with over the year. This year's card is Thopter Pie Network. See it for yourself!

After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Standard Primer](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/andrewjessup-11212016-standard-primer/) | Gathering Magic | Andrew Jessup

[Standard Showdown](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/standard-showdown) starts this weekend, so Jessup's primer on the Standard format is quite timely. What do you need to know to prepare yourself for the four-week tournament series? Jessup has the answers. And deck lists, of course.


1. [Support Your Gaming Community By Being Your Gaming Community](http://www.manaleak.com/mtguk/2016/11/support-your-gaming-community-by-being-your-gaming-community/) | The Mana Leak | Jason Coles

This is kind of a "be the changes you want to see in the world" sort of deal, but for *Magic*. And it's quite correct. One of the best things about our game is the community it creates, and shaping those communities into positive, fun, supportive things is on you, and you, and you, and especially you.


1. ["Entropic Uprising" Commander 2016 Deck Tech and Upgrades featuring Yidris, Maelstrom Wielder!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=756Vzgfs70w) | The Mana Source | Wedge

Wedge completes his look at upgrading the *Commander (2016 Edition)* decks with [Yidris, Maelstrom Wielder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yidris%2C+Maelstrom+Wielder), and just in time for Thanksgiving, too. Nothing brings a family closer together than sitting down with an upgraded Yidris deck and cascading all over their faces. It's basically a holiday tradition.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Each year, I am more and more proud of the [@DesertBus](https://twitter.com/DesertBus) team. My friend Alex gave this speech in the final hours.<https://t.co/UHWaXxsdfx>
> 
> 
>  â€” Andrew Cownden (@AndrewCownden) [November 19, 2016](https://twitter.com/AndrewCownden/status/800015615008260096)

[Desert Bus for Hope](https://desertbus.org/) concluded over the weekend with a staggering total of $694,560 donated in support of Child's Play Charity, and near the end of a stream that lasted more than 6 days, Alex Steacy delivered this emotional message.


1. [Storm Scale: Zendikar and Battle for Zendikar](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5e4lfb/storm_scale_zendikar_and_battle_for_zendikar/)

These types of articles from Rosewater always get discussion going, and this Reddit thread is no exception. [The article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/storm-scale-zendikar-and-battle-zendikar-2016-11-21) covers Rosewater's "Storm Scale," which ranks mechanics on how likely they are to be used again. This time he covers the mechanics from both Zendikar blocks, and people spend a good deal of time in the thread agreeing vehemently or disagreeing even more vehemently. Because the Internet.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Brad Nelson's Black-Green Delirium](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=109720)

[The king is back](https://twitter.com/fffreakmtg/status/800513019608502272)! Brad Nelson, long known for his mastery of Standard, once again stands atop the Standard heap after winning the StarCityGames.com Knoxville Open with his take on Black-Green Delirium.


There aren't many mysteries about this *Shadows over Innistrad*-based deck, but Nelson does have a few unique marks on the deck. The single [Noxious Gearhulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Gearhulk) isn't abnormal, but it's far from standard. The single [Tireless Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker) also stands out as a particularly Nelson-like flair, and the [Pilgrim's Eye](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pilgrim%27s+Eye)s let Nelson hit Delirium more reliably while fixing his mana.


If you're playing in a [Standard Showdown](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/standard-showdown) this weekend, be very ready for this one.
