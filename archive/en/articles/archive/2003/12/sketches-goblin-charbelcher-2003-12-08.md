Welcome to another edition of [Sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches:). This week we take an interactive look at **[Goblin Charbelcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher)**, the damage-chucking artifact from *Mirrodin*. The piece was painted by **Stephen Tappin**, who also illustrated [Auriok Transfixer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer) and [Nuisance Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nuisance+Engine) in the *Mirrodin* set.


### 1. Art Description


Here are the instructions that were given to Stephen for the piece:



> 
> "Color: Red-aligned Artifact  
> 
> Location: Generic  
> 
> Action: Show a sort of magical mortar tube. The weapon fires spell energy that appears as multicolored balls of fire and spark.  
> 
> Focus: The spell-mortar weapon  
> 
> Mood: FOOM!"
> 
> 
> 


### 2. Sketch


Mr. Tappin came up with this initial sketch:



FOOM indeed. We have the mortar-like artifact poised on metal legs, standing against a generic background of spiky cone structures. This is immediately recognizable as close to the final art of [Goblin Charbelcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher), but the twist comes when Stephen adds color to the illustration.


### 3. Final Art


Below is a color sketch subsequently submitted by Mr. Tappin for the project. The art team didn't like the bluish tones of the piece, since the Charbelcher's ability associates it with Mountains and therefore red. Blue was therefore right out. But since it will turn out that the final art is so close in composition to this color sketch, we thought it'd be a good time to whip out the Sketches Flip-Book technology again to compare it with the final art.


Click the buttons below the image to switch between the blue-toned color sketch initially submitted, and the final art submitted with the red cranked way up. *(Depending on your connection speed, it might take a few seconds for the image to change.)*

You can see that the color palette of the final art has warmed up considerably -- it is now a weapon that Goblins could be proud of.


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as you can see it in booster packs.
