San Diego Comic-Con was the gift that keeps on giving, revealing a pair of cards from *Magic: The Gathering—Commander* (2014 Edition), spilling some *Khans of Tarkir* secrets, and showing off some art from *From the Vault: Annihilation*, like this gorgeous Cataclysm art.

One item we didn't reveal to the excited throngs was the packaging for *From the Vault: Annihilation*, because there was just so much other stuff to show off.


Let us rectify that, shall we?

As they say, *Boom*.



Look for this box exploding off shelves starting August 22, 2014.
