By Blake Rasmussen




Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






This week, we're on episode five of six of the *Magic* Story Podcast, and we're joined by Ari Levitch, the creative lead for *Aether Revolt* and one of the members of the *Kaladesh* worldbuilding team. He's here to talk about building *Kaladesh* and shaking things up for *Aether Revolt*.


The *Magic* Story Podcast goes behind the scenes with the people who make the worlds, create the characters, and infuse this game with imagination. We have one more episode left before the return of *Magic Story* when *Amonkhet* season kicks off March 29!
