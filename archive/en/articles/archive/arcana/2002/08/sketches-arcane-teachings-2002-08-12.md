This week's Sketches looks at the *Judgment* common [Arcane Teachings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Teachings) by Mark Brill. This card has an interesting story behind it.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"A dwarven mage, perhaps a cleric, doing his thing (not fire-related). This card should show a dwarven mage in his study intently studying some object there. The focus should be on the mage."

The nifty thing about this art was that is was not originally for [Arcane Teachings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Teachings), and wasn't even for *Judgment*. The card this description was for was a *Torment* common called [Dwarven Cleric], a 1/1 for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) that had the text of [Pitchstone Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pitchstone+Wall): "Whenever you discard a card from your hand, you may sacrifice CARDNAME. If you do, return the discarded card from your graveyard to your hand."### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Mark. 

The problem was that [Dwarven Cleric] was switched into [Pitchstone Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pitchstone+Wall) after the art was commissioned, and once it was done there was no card to use it on. So it just sat around unused.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final piece. 

There was a card in the *Judgment* file named [Big Tim]. When the creative team saw that it was a red card that could potentially use the old [Dwarf Cleric] art, they came up with a good name to tie it all together, [Arcane Teachings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Teachings).

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today.
