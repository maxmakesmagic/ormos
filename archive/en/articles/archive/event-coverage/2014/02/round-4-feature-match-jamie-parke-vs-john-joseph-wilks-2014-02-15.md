As a true format of old Legacy also brings some faces from *Magic*'s past back to the tournament scene. Round four saw American Jamie Parke with two Pro Tour top 8's to his name against Briton John-Joseph Wilks. Still early in the day, both players could call themselves undefeated with 3-0 records.

"I have to say, I was not expecting a feature match. You must be well known?," asked John-Joseph Wilks politely.


"Once upon a time I was," answered Jamie Parke, confessing that his glory days were at the end of last century.


Parke was piloting Stoneblade with [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) and [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) in addition to [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic)s and equipments. Wilks was on UWR Stoneblade/Delver with [True-Name Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis). Although he might as well have been playing mono Blue as the match played out.


The first game was a display of the newly printed Commander card's strength against an opponent caught off guard. Jamie Parke opened with [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), revealing all [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s and cantrips for the Briton, making him feel confident about tapping out on turn three to recast a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) with [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage).


Wilks answered with a [True-Name Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) on his turn, and five attacks later Jamie Parke was reaching for his sideboard. Hoping that two copies of [Zealous Persecution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zealous+Persecution) would be able to handle [True-Name Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) better in the following games.

The second game also came down to [True-Name Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis). [Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis) number one was sent to the bottom of Wilks library with a [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique). [Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis) number two was swept by a [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict). But after an extremely long and complex game Wilks third [True-Name Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) was able to hold off Jamie Parke's only offense in the form of a Germ Token equipped with both [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) and [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) long enough for time to be called in the round.


On his last extra turn Parke searched for answers to it with two [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), but couldn't find any. He extended his hand in concession of not being able to win in time, and the match ended 1-0 to John-Joseph Wilks advantage.


"I'm sure I made a few mistakes along the way, please let me know if you saw any," said Wilks after the match, explaining how this was one of his first Legacy matches ever played.
