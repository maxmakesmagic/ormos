 --from the art description of Experiment Kraj 

Yesterday, [Mark Rosewater previewed *Dissension's* Experiment Kraj](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/seeds-dissension-2006-04-10), a legendary Simic monstrosity capable of "evolving" the strengths and abilities of other creatures. **Magic** artist top-gun Mark Tedin was aimed at the task of illustrating the thing. 

He came up with this:

These comments from artists are golden — they help the creative team get inside the artist's head, hear that the artist is on the same conceptual page as the art description, and predict what the final, colorized art will look like. Speaking of which...

### Experiment Kraj Factoids

* During playtest, Kraj's name was spelled with the Slavic spelling "Eksperiment Kraj," reflecting Ravnica's flavor influences from Slavic Europe.
* Kraj's creature type was originally "Ooze Mutant Shapeshifter." That's a mouthful, especially after "Legendary Creature—", and "Shapeshifter" was cut in order for the type line to fit.
* In the lower right-hand corner, you can see an elven figure with his back to the viewer. That's Momir Vig, the guild leader of the Simic Combine. You'll see more of him later.
* Go to the [*Dissension* Prerelease](/en/articles/archive/dissension-worldwide-prerelease-locations-2006-03-28) April 22-23. Okay, that's not a factoid about Experiment Kraj. But do it anyway!
