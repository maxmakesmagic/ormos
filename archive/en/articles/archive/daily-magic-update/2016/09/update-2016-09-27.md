The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 27, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by voting. The Daily *Magic* Update holds no political views except that you should vote. Though the first candidate to come out in favor of reprinting [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) might get our endorsement.


Today's Must
============


1. [*Kaladesh* Set Review: White](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13530&writer=TCGplayer+Staff&articledate=9-27-2016&utm_source=tcg-social&utm_medium=tcg-social&utm_term=&utm_content=magic&utm_campaign=tcg-social-mtg) | TCGPlayer

TCGPlayer does set reviews in a way no one else does: instead of one writer making their way through the entire set or an entire color, the TCGPlayer team—seven in total—scores cards to get aggregate ratings, which are then presented in video form. The article above also lists out all of the aggregate scores for Standard, Limited, and Modern. It is exceedingly thorough.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [*Kaladesh* Constructed Set Review: White](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/kaladesh-constructed-set-review-white/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

The highlander route works for set reviews too. After a week of pun-filled Limited reviews, Scott-Vargas switches gears and brings us a—well, a week of pun-filled Constructed reviews. First up is white.


1. [Phrexians in *Aether Revolt*?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGqoJCi8GmI) | Seibenlore

Ah, yes, the "It's the Phyrexians" theory given video form. Players have been guessing this since we started previews. The theory goes portals + artifacts + Tezzeret = Phyrexians. This one seems like a stretch to me, but, then again, I keep watching [*Armageddon*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120591/?ref_=nv_sr_1) hoping Bruce Willis doesn't have to say goodbye to Liv Tyler. So what do I know about plot?

1. [Top 10 Ways to Madcap For Fun and Profit](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/abesargent-09272016-top-ten-ways-to-madcap-for-fun-and-profit/) | Gathering Magic | Abe Sargent

[Madcap Experiment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Madcap+Experiment) is the kind of card that scratches a certain kind of itch for a certain kind of player. You know who you are. Sargent's Top 10 list covers some fun and powerful ways to experiment. You won't believe how powerful No. 1 is! It will blow your mind!


1. [The Kitchen Sink](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2016/09/the-kitchen-sink/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Zach Barash

Barash noticed something interesting about *Kaladesh*—fewer mana sinks to mitigate flood in the long game. He talks about what it means and what to do about it.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Split Second](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33735_Split-Second-September-26th-2016.html) | StarCityGames.com

If you're reading this, you already have a thing for recaps. Well, for a few weeks now, StarCityGames.com has been recapping the day's news in video form in something called Split Second. It's a little odd for a daily update article to point you to another daily update (Updateception?), but they often cover news I don't and vice versa. It's a cool video series, and we know I'm pro recaps.


Judge Promos
============


1. Newest Judge Promos

Judges who have been recognized for doing exceptional things in their local community receive promos through their peers. These are the new cards being released with this wave of the *Magic* Judge Exemplar program!

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> (Joshua) I am not sure how anyone can play with or against [Peregrine Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Drake) in [#mtgpauper](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtgpauper?src=hash) and think that it is good for the format.

The Pauper community still seems to be a touch in shock that [Peregrine Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Drake) wasn't banned, though some [are being proactive about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pauper/comments/54l673/dont_give_up_lets_brew_the_ultimate_drake_killer/). Others, [less so](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pauper/comments/54l673/dont_give_up_lets_brew_the_ultimate_drake_killer/d82r5hl). And Alex Ullman wrote [an interesting piece](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/alexullman-09272016-drakes-and-deadlines/) on Gathering Magic that was him predicting what would happen with the Pauper Banned and Restricted list before the list was published—only his article was published after. Reading it in retrospect feels a bit spooky, morbid even.

> [@davespace](https://twitter.com/davespace) [@Chosler88](https://twitter.com/Chosler88) It's a neat idea and has support from some big stores, but M15 forward doesn't appeal to me at all.

People are still digesting the news that Hareruya, one of the largest, most prominent stores in the world (and located in Japan) is experimenting with a format people are calling Post-Modern—basically, all cards from *Magic 2015* and forward are legal. Reactions [all around are mixed](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/54jyvl/postmodern_has_begun_hareruya_and_bigmagic_team/), so who knows if it goes anywhere, but when Hareruya does something like this, people certainly take notice. Expect some more talk after the tournament runs and decklists start making their way out into the public.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Too Marvelous for Words](http://articles.mtgcardmarket.com/too-marvelous-for-words/) | MTGCardMarket | Charles League

A lot of people initially looked at [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) and, well, marveled, but there hasn't been a ton of brewing with it since the initial shockwave of hype. But League aims to fix that, with a high-energy concoction that can start churning out [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End), [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger), and [World Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker) as early as turn four.


The deck uses a number of incidental energy producers—[Attune with Aether](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attune+with+Aether), various [Puzzleknots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5bPuzzleknot%5d), [Glimmer of Genius](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmer+of+Genius), and [Aether Meltdown](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Meltdown)—to power up its energy supply, before landing a Marvel and doing something marvelous.


The deck looks like a blast to play, and certainly a blast to goldfish. Break out the artifact destruction, because otherwise League's Marvelous contraption will send you packing.
