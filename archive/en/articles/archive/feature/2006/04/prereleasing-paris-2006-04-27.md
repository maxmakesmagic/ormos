### Welcome to GP Paris! Err… no wait, to the Paris Prerelease of *Dissension*

I played a prerelease in Moscow and another one in Tokyo in 2005, but it’s been a long time since I last played one in Paris. The huge crowd waiting to register was the first good surprise. Of course the tournament wouldn't start early, but as there would be another prerelease in Paris suburbs on Sunday, who would have guessed the attendance would be so huge?

473 players, that was the only similarity with a Grand Prix. The French prerelease system works as follows:   
 -One main event (no flights)  
 -Straight swiss rounds (no top8)  
 -The winner of every match receives a *Dissension*  booster pack.  
 -all players going at least X/2 receive product, X/0 receiving a display  
  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/ads/Be%20Oc%20Gabriel2.jpg) I came to try to get as many packs as possible as I am going to Amsterdam today to practice for Prague. I was not the only one to come up with this idea as Gabriel Nassif, Julien Goron, Florent Jeudon, Amiel Tenenbaum and few other players qualified for Prague made it to the prerelease.

My sealed deck offered me a solid White/Red/Black deck with not-so-good creatures but great removal spells as I was running double [Seal of Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire), [Seal of Doom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Doom), [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix), [Galvanic Arc](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Arc), [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp), [Wrecking Ball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrecking+Ball), [Kindle the Carnage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kindle+the+Carnage) and [Flash Conscription](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash+Conscription). If I don't like Conscription much in draft, it can be really strong in Sealed deck, since it is a really slow format. As I had two UW duals ([Azorius Chancery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Chancery) and [Hallowed Fountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain)) as well as [Azorius Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Signet), I checked in my card pile whether there were any blue cards I’d like to play. I found one of my favourite commons in *Ravnica*: [Compulsive Research](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research). As my creatures where pretty low, I also added [Snapping Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake) to my deck.![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/ads/Be%20Oc%20Compulsive2.jpg)  
 When I first opened my deck, I was pretty excited about the rares, having besides the dualland [Cerulean Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cerulean+Sphinx), [Master Warcraft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Warcraft) and [Experiment Kraj](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+Kraj). Eventually, except for the land, they all ended in my sideboard. It was obvious choice for the Sphinx as blue was just a tiny little splash, but the choice of not playing [Master Warcraft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Warcraft) was more questionable. There are two reasons that made me take this decision:   
  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/ads/Be%20Oc%20Master.jpg)

* 1)Master Warcraft is a very good card, but it's not a spoiler to me, as it wins games only in some conditions. It would be more like a split card Predatory Focus/Fog, meaning it wins games in case of race or of a very tight situation. These conditions often happen in draft, but they are way rarer in sealed deck.
* 2)Playing nearly only removals and 2/2s, I couldn’t expect much more than a Fog from it.

This build has been the tougher one of the prereleases I entered. But in both cases, there is still this one thing I like about prerelease events: This impression every single combo is the result of your imagination, not of your experience as it will be in the weeks. Here are the cards or the combos that kept my attention in the week end:

-Duals and Signets are getting more and more important, they will be high picked in draft pretty soon.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/ads/Be%20Oc%20Quickchange.jpg)-[Transguild Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transguild+Courier) + [Might of the Nephilim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+the+Nephilim), or how a [Hill Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant) + [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) can deal 13 damages. I’ve even played [Quickchange](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quickchange) in my first draft of the format, featuring [Might of the Nephilim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+the+Nephilim), [Gelectrode](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gelectrode) and [Wee Dragonauts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wee+Dragonauts). It finally helped against [Guardian of the Guildpact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardian+of+the+Guildpact) and [Enemy of the Guildpact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enemy+of+the+Guildpact) also, and turned out to be pretty good.

-[Reroute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reroute) has become a pretty decent sideboard card against [Seal of Doom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Doom) and [Seal of Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire).

-[Helium Squirter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helium+Squirter) + [Trophy Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trophy+Hunter): Twice in seven rounds I gave an opponent’s creature +1/+1 and made it fly to shoot it with my Hunter. Rather expensive but quite interesting.

-![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/ads/Be%20Oc%20Rakdos.jpg)[Beacon Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+Hawk) + Tims: combined either with [Viashino Fangtail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Fangtail), [Rakdos Ickspitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Ickspitter), [Wojek Embermage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wojek+Embermage) or [Gelectrode](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gelectrode), the hawk is just like a second Tim.

-[Protean Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk) won’t unfortunately bring 4 Kokushos into play, breaking my first hopes…

-[Loaming Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loaming+Shaman): Pretty good in mid game as it reshuffles all removals and drawing spells back to the deck.

-[Omnibian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omnibian): nearly as cool as [Ovinomancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ovinomancer)


  
  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/ads/Be%20Oc%20Azorius.jpg)-[Azorius First-Wing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+First-Wing): the 2/2 flyer pro enchantment is not only sheltered from [Faith Fetter's](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith+Fetter%27s) and the [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism)-like, it can also block [Halcyon Glaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halcyon+Glaze).

-[Patagia Viper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patagia+Viper) and friends: they’re not like [Knight of the Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Mists), you can pay the requested mana as part of the casting cost; it's not an extra.

-Eidolons: Good if you don't have many 4 mana cards, and if you have lots of golds.

[Vigean Graftmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigean+Graftmage) + [Ocular Halo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ocular+Halo): 1U: draw a card, your opponent would better kill your guy immediately.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/ads/Be%20Oc%20Leafdrake.jpg)-[Leafdrake Roost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafdrake+Roost): I've played two prereleases. This has been the only card on an opponent's board that let me totally hopeless. It even makes me want to try to get some land destruction just in case.

-[Carom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carom): Very good trick, particularly VS [Rakdos Ickspitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Ickspitter).

-[Research](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Research)/[Development](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Development): Most of people don't realize it, but it's just a five mana [Compulsive Research](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research), drawing 3 is nearly always the best thing that can happen to you. Its great advantage compared to Compulsive is that it’s an instant. 

-[Bond of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bond+of+Agony): Can be an interesting finisher, a sideboard card probably.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/ads/Be%20Oc%20Ignorant.jpg)-[Ignorant Bliss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignorant+Bliss): pretty good in limited if you are using *Hellbent*. Excellent sideboard in Constructed against hand destruction.

-[Macabre Waltz](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Macabre+Waltz): Very strong in mid or late game, another combo with [Izzet Chronarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Chronarch).

I ended up winning this prerelease and losing in the last round of the second one only. 57 packs, and a lot of drafts coming. Come back on Saturday for my first draft analysis.
