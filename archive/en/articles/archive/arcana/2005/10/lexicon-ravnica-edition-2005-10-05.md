The goal of the Lexicon is to teach players the meanings of some of the more obscure words we use in card names. While many of the offbeat names (like "[Drooling Groodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Drooling%2BGroodion)") are simply made up, we often dig around dictionaries for real little-used and archaic words for inspiration. Check out these Lexicon entries drawn from *Ravnica: City of Guilds* cards.
