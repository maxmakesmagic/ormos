### Game 1

![Auriok Glaivemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Auriok+Glaivemaster)The game started with an [Auriok Glaivemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Glaivemaster) and [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) from Andreas to an [Iron Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr) and [Bonesplitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter) from Raul. Both players tryed to better their mana, Andreas using an [Aether Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb) and his opponent with a [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) and [Thoughtcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast). During an attack from Andreas, Raul traded a [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) token for the Auriok, his life now at eleven and played a [Pteron Ghost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost), a [Fatespinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatespinner) and an [Auriok Transfixer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer) on his turn.

Andreas selected to skip his combat phase for the next turn, and plays a [Pristine Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pristine+Angel), a Vulshok Morningstar and a [Darksteel Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Gargoyle), while Raul adds an Hoverguard Overseer, [Neurok Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Prodigy), [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) to his side of the table. During his opponents turn, Raul used the transfixer to tap the Gargoyle and on his turn the [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem), attacked with most of his creatures to bring Andreas to nine life, losing only the golem to the angel. 

Two turns later Raul did the same play, this time attacking with all his creatures, which by now also included [Stalking Stones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones) and an [Arcbound Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger). But Andreas had something up his sleeve - he played an [Altar's Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Light) on the stones and a [Barbed Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed+Lightning) on the overseer. He also blocked the token so only got down to 3 life. On his next turn he skipped the draw step, cast a [Vulshok Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker) and attacked with all, winning the game.

### Game 2

Raul started with [Vulshok Battlegear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear), [Fatespinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatespinner), while Andreas cycled an [Aether Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb) and played a [Soldier Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica). Andreas skipped his next draw steps in order to equip the soldier first with Vulshok Morningstar and then with the [Bonesplitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter), putting his opponent at twelve life.

Raul played a Golden Myr and an [Auriok Bladewarden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Bladewarden), and attacked Andreas with the [Fatespinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatespinner), but a Roar of the Ka untapped the soldier who immediately blocked the fatespinner.

Being once again able to use all phases of his turn, Andreas cast a [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem), which was equipped with the morningstar and brought Raul to seven life. Meanwhile Raul equipped the bladewarden with the battlegear, and played [Clockwork Vorrac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Vorrac), [Cobalt Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobalt+Golem), [Somber Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard) and [Auriok Transfixer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer). When some turns later Raul played his [Leonin Bola](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Bola), there was nothing Andreas could do and he conceded.

### Game 3

Andreas playing first started attacking with Pteroc Ghost and [Bonesplitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter), but with the [Auriok Transfixer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer) and [Vedalken Engineer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Engineer) Raul played on his first two turns, he was able to cast and equip the Auriok with a [Viridian Longbow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) and kill the ghost. The next turn, he played a Vulshok Morningstar and equipped the Auriok with it and the bonesplitter, and put Andreas at 15.

To Andreas Leadfoot Raul responded with a [Clockwork Vorrac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Vorrac), while the Auriok caused five more damage. When the Vorrac received the equipment from the Auriok, it only took two attacks to make Andreas concede.
