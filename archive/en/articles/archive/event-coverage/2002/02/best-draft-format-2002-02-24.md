I polled quite a number of Magic players about their favorite draft format in Magic history. Here's what they had to say.

**Jon Becker:** Saga Block, because I could always draft the same deck every time, and the cards were just consistent.

**Brian Davis:** Invasion block, because I loved 5 color green. I drafted it every time.

**Antonino DeRosa:** Tempest Block, because I love beatdown, and all the decks in that format were fast.

**Rob Dougherty:***Odyssey* block, because of Magic Online. I can draft all the time, and it's given me an amazing amount of practice.

**Jeff Fung:** Tempest block, because I made $10,000 and drew my Helm every time.

**William "Baby Huey" Jensen:** Urza Saga block, because I liked playing 5 color green. Me and Mike Bregoli started playing that before it became popular in Invasion block and we got laughed atâ€”until we both made Top 8 at a Pro Tour with our strategy.

**Eric Kesselman:** Invasion, because you could draft literally any color combination, and they were all viable. There was just so much versatility and so much power.

**Sean McKeown:** Saga block. I had a really cool blue deck I liked to draft, and I could draft it every time.

**Brook North:** Tempest block! Dark Ritual was great.

**Dan OMS:** Saga block, because I knew every card in the format and could keep track of them in drafts. I won a lot of matches because of that.

**Steve OMS:** Tempest only. Everyone was so horrible back then, so I won all the time.

**Alex Shvartsman:** Saga block, for sure. It was fun, balanced, and fairly powerful. I absolutely hated Tempest block.

**Mike Turian:** Straight Tempest. I could draft lots of Rootwallas.

**Tim Weissman:** Saga Block, because of Machine Gun (Hermetic Study + Horseshoe Crab).
