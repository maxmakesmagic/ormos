Oh, hello! We didn't see you there.

You enjoy reading things written by Mark Rosewater, Aaron Forsythe, and other Wizards of the Coast employees. That's why you're here. But let's say you want to see them in person. Let's say you want to witness some sort of panel. And while we're arbitrarily assigning you motivations and goals, let's say that you were already planning on going to the San Diego Comic Con this year.

Well, we have good news! Here's what's happening **Thursday, July 22**!


> 6:30-7:30 **Magic: The Gathering Panel** â€” On the heels of **Magic**'s most successful year in its 17-year history, some of the game's top creators share details on upcoming products as well as answer your questions. The panel, moderated by **Mark Rosewater** (head **Magic** designer), includes **Aaron Forsythe** (director, **Magic** R&D), **Brian Tinsman** (lead designer, *Rise of the Eldrazi*), **Richard Whitters** (lead **Magic** concept artist), and others. ***Room 26AB***
