Announcing the Love Your LGS Promotion

Around the world, as different regions begin to take steps toward opening up stores, we'll be rolling out a program to reward players for shopping with local game stores—when they can safely do so.


Before we get to the promotion, we want to stress that stores should only open when their local authorities deem it safe for them to do so. But when they do and can open, we wanted them to have a little something waiting for you.


Any stores that are able to sell product (including pick-up services) on or after the weekend of June 5—and we're not setting an end date right now, as different regions will have different opening requirements—will receive promos and art prints for their players to go along with [the previously announced *Mystery Booster*s](https://wpn.wizards.com/en/article/lets-double-everyones-mystery-booster-allocation?utm_source=ICO+Partners+Media+Contacts&utm_campaign=8b9d349e85-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_04_07_01_30&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_3cc7159252-8b9d349e85-412601835&mc_cid=8b9d349e85&mc_eid=7c7eb7e4b7), all free of charge to the store. Participating stores will be able to hand out some pretty cool items, like:

How can you get each of these? Great and relevant question—thanks for asking.


To start with, make *any* purchase or buy *any* event entry (including store-run online events), and you can receive the Reliquary Tower (limit one per customer, while supplies last).


If you really want to show your love to your local game store, purchase a box of any product—including *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths* or *Mystery Booster*—and you'll receive possibly the coolest Buy-a-Box promo we've ever done (while supplies last)—a Hangarback Walker with the Mechagodzilla treatment. These are not limited to one per customer.


Finally, for stores where people are able to safely gather—and we know for some that may not come for a while—anyone who participates in a Love Your Local Game Store event is eligible to receive an art print from the store, while supplies last. Check with your store for more information on if and when these events might take place.


While we're all eager to get back to something resembling normal, we do want to emphasize that stores and players should all closely follow the advice of their local officials and only open up or go to public spaces when it is safe to do so and advised by officials.


But when it is safe, let's show our love for our local game stores in any way we can—and get a little bonus for doing so.
