By 9:00 Friday night the seven rounds as well as the top 8 of the Grand Prix trial were complete. Fujieda Isamu was victorious with his fairly stock-type mono-red deck with four Phyrexian Furnace in the sideboard. In the finals he defeated Choyama Shuryu's 61 card countersliver deck. Rounding out the to four were Hakaru Nasao with his mono-red deck containing two Thunderbolts and two maindeck Pyroblasts and Hisaya Tanaka and his Replenish deck that used Fact or Fiction as well as Frantic Search to put Pandemonium and Saproling Burst into his graveyard. Replenish those two enchantments out and you can deal 21 points of damage directly to your opponent by removing counters from the Saproling Burst one at a time.
