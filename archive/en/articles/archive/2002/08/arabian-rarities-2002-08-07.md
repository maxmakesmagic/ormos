If you've looked at our *Arabian Nights* card list ([here](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=magic/cardlist/arabiannights)), you may be wondering what the rarities codes are.


*Arabian Nights* did not have three print sheets of cards like current sets do (four, if the set includes basic lands). Instead there was only a common and uncommon sheet, and the cards were on those sheets in different frequencies. Each sheet contained 121 cards.


The rarity code for each card consists of a letter that tells you which sheet it was on, and a number that tells you how many times it appeared. The three cards shown below are all commons.


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/global/images/mtgcom_arcana_155_pic1_en.jpg)So for every five [Unstable Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable+Mutation) cards printed, four [War Elephant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Elephant) cards were printed.


The most common card? [Desert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desert), which has a rarity of C11. The only card to appear one time on a sheet? The Arabian [mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=mountain), which has a rarity of C1, making it just as hard to find as cards with a rarity of U3. (The common-uncommon ratio was 3:1 in the booster packs.)
