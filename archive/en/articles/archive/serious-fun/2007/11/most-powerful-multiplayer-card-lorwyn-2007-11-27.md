A few surprises there; I thought for sure that [Wild Ricochet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet) would score higher, since the power of it is pretty obvious, as Phaseshifter notes here:



> 
> I believe the most powerful card for multiplayer in *Lorwyn* is [Wild Ricochet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet). I'm actually having a hard time finding things that it *can't* help you with.
> 
> 
> The best thing you can use it for is of course, to win. If someone points a game winning burn or drain spell at you, you get to send it back to their face, AND damage or get rid of another opponent.
> 
> 
>  
> 
> 
> 
> ![Wild Ricochet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wild+Ricochet)
> 
> The best thing is that a player trying to drain you with black spells wouldn't usually worry too much about about a redirection effect, since on resolution, their life total would be the same. But wild ricochet lets you deal double, so they're not safe anymore. You could even take 1 of the copies to remove an annoying creature from play while you're at it. It wouldn't be hard to copy and redirect an X spell at 2 players, and then attack the 3rd one for the win, even while you were seemingly losing.
> 
> 2. [Wild Ricochet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet) can also be used for card advantage or tempo. Whenever someone uses a card drawing spell that targets, you can draw DOUBLE that amount (and of course deny them to whoever wanted them). If someone searches target player's deck for something, you can search for up to 2 of them from the deck of any player you want. Plus, your copy resolves first, so if they're the only copies of those cards left, all the original caster gets to do is look at a deck.
> 
> 
> 3. Life insurance. Many games are lost and won because someone screwed the math. You attack someone thinking that your other opponent can't kill you in 1 turn, then a [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) or [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) shows up and adds lethal to your equation. [Wild Ricochet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet) protects you from that. Suddenly, all that spell now does is make your blocker bigger, or lower someone else's life total. Of course you can use it to make someone else's attack become lethal too, just to make sure an annoying opponent's turn never comes.
> 
> 
> 4. Diplomacy. [Wild Ricochet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet) can have effects beyond board position. Imagine a player plays a draw spell at the end of someone's turn, and another of your opponents takes the opportunity to use [Willbender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Willbender) and get those cards. You can use [Wild Ricochet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet) to change the target back to the original caster, then copy it and get some cards back for your troubles. Not only did you make yourself some cards, but you probably made a friend too in the process since he owes his drawn cards to you. Plus, you probably would have discarded half of them had you taken both.
> 
> 
> 5. Rattlesnake. Once you've played one Ricochet, people will think twice before targeting something at you when you have 4 lands untapped, since they run the risk of seeing it sent back to them with interest.
> 
> 
> 6. Good in all multiplayer formats. [Wild Ricochet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet) is good no matter which MP format you play in. In 2vs2 or 3vs3 you can either piggyback on your partner's spells, or use it to cover them. In Emperor, you can double and reuse a spell cast by your emperor, which are usually support spells to begin with. In attack left/right, you can do what you always dream of doing in this format, screw both sides at the same time.
> 
> 
> 7. Yourself. Of course, you can always use it to simply double one of your own spell. And if that wasn't bad enough, you can get it back on track if someone else wants to use redirection
> 
> 
> 8. Make up for your weaknesses. When playing mono-red, its no secret that the sight of an enchantment can often be a nightmare. Because they're usually there to stay. [Wild Ricochet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet) gives you a little help there. If ANY player plays a spell that can destroy an enchantment, you can jack it and get rid of whatever's bothering you. And if there's only one of it, you let the player destroy the original target so as not to draw attention to yourself.
> 
> 
> Finally, [Wild Ricochet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet) is great because it's good at pretty much all times, and deals with almost every kind of threat. You can deal with combat tricks, steal end-of-turn utility spells, draw cards in mono-red, and steal a win away from THREE players.

> I don't think we can ask from much more in multiplayer from a single card.

...And I agree. Admittedly, a four-mana trick is pretty difficult to hold in reserve, but the effect is clearly worth it. And yet it only got five votes! And [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) got a lot more of the love than I thought he would, since frankly I wrote him off as a duelists-only card. (You give the love to others to deplete a third of one player's library? Not so much for me, folks.)


Interestingly, [Guile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guile) got a meager two votes. Honestly, I'd like to think that [Guile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guile)'s the kind of card that can make Mono-Blue [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) decks a little more viable in multiplayer, allowing you to counter something with [Pact of Negation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation) and then use it to horrid effect. But I have to work with what I got here.


(Note that Mono-Blue [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) is an entirely different archetype from Mono-Blue Steal Everything with [Vedalken Shackles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles), Control Magic Effects [[Treachery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery) is the best], and [Bribery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery)—an archetype that *does* work quite well without help.)


Add in the tragically low rankings for [Shapesharer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapesharer), and I'm beginning to think you folks hate blue.


And dudes—[Arbiter of Knollridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbiter+of+Knollridge) is a cool effect. But practically nobody told me how you win with it, aside from assuming a tideswell of gratitude from other players that I doubt will ever arrive. ("Um, so if I get this guy down to five, you'll bring him back up to nineteen? Yeah, I'd probably better kill you first.")


But what other posts were noteworthy?


Well, for [Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread), Yaniv G. had this interesting concept:

The idea is that [Fumiko the Lowblood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumiko+the+Lowblood) forces others to attack (while [Forbidden Orchard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Orchard) and [Hunted Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Dragon) give them creatures to do it with), while [Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread) and [Hissing Miasma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hissing+Miasma) encourage them to look elsewhere. A neat idea, truly it is, but a) you have three [Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread)s and no tutoring to get them, and b) if the [Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread) goes away, then ugly things happen. So I like the idea, but the execution needs a little work in some focus (though mega-points for using one of my favorite cards of all time, [Sun Droplet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Droplet)).


Robin H. gets kudos for turning all sorts of ugly drawbacks into benefits when [Purity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purity) is on the board:

Unfortunately, [Purity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purity)—while a great card—is a late-game emerger, and you can't hold your spells until it arrives. I love the concept here, and it's about as well-executed as you could hope for, but considering this deck only comes online at five mana, you can get swarmed in the early game while waiting for enough land (only 23?). A great try, but not quite.

> 
> There's a lot of cool synergies here—[Ravenous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) can turn all of Garruk's Beast tokens into life, all the two-mana accelerants help you hit your four-mana gas a turn early (of which Mr. Planeswalker is probably the best to see), and it even has a small Loam engine to boot. Speaking of Mr. Planeswalker, though, Garruk does a lot for a deck like this—his first ability makes it easier to ramp up to fatty-mana (or ensure you have mana open for [Tangle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle) the turn you drop him), his second ability applies pressure and helps you recover quickly from mass removal, and his third ability will let you alpha strike at your leisure... a pretty saucy pack of abilities if you ask me. If you're able to hold off pressure long enough with your walls and fogs, it should be pretty easy to lay down Garruk and get a couple of 3/3s going, allowing you to conserve your resources for much longer as your giant smashy planeswalker does your dirty work for you.

> And really, conserving your resources is the key to winning multiplayer... if one of your cards can deal with a whole bunch of your opponent's stuff, you're all of a sudden a long way towards winning the game. Garruk is one of the best cards for doing so that I've seen in a long time... his constant stream of Beasts makes people scramble for removal, and the threat of a game-ending [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) puts them on a short clock to do so.

Daniel W brings up a good point about [Captivating Glance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captivating+Glance):



> 
> The Glance's true worth lies in its political power. Imagine the following:
> 
> 
> Player A: I drop my [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus)! Take that, world!  
> 
> You: [Captivating Glance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captivating+Glance) on it. So, who wants the chance to win a [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus)?
> 
> 
> Yes, the key point is that you don't have to clash with the creature's controller. So for three mana, whoever owns the DC or whatever is definitely going to lose it; and you've either just got one for yourself, or made a new friend! (And probably really annoyed its former master, but you can't have everything... Maybe he can win it back when your next turn comes around. If you feel kind.)
> 
> 
> If you do happen to win the clash, then it's also fun to bounce the [Captivating Glance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captivating+Glance) back to your hand. Since it's the triggered ability that swaps controllers, and not the enchantment itself, you'll retain control of the creature and be free to entice another creature away from its owner.

While we're talking politics, Doc Brown gives a good point: [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring)'s a very political card. Which is to say, "Yes, I currently have a [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus), a [Liliana Vess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess), and an Akroma bound up in my Rings. If you kill me, then that player will get them all back." Which is a disincentive for the other players, but a severe incentive for the player with all of the stolen stuff, so I don't know how that balances out.


I thought we'd get a lot more votes for [Deathrender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrender), but here's a neat little combo deck for you from David that goes infinite by going into an loop with a [Deathrender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrender) that cycles between any of [Mausoleum Turnkey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Turnkey), [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), and [Warren Pilferers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warren+Pilferers), sacrificing to do damage with [Blasting Station](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasting+Station), gain life with [Life Chisel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+Chisel), or [Millstone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millstone) someone with the classic [Altar of Dementia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+Dementia):

> You don't need to be genius to get the main idea of the deck: Opponents discard cards -- You get Elves. Your Elves die -- opponent's creatures die. What happens if you have Nath and [Grave Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Pact) in the game and you use [Smallpox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox)? Everyone loses 1 life, discards a card (giving you Elf tokens), everyone sacrifices a creature (you sacrifice one of your tokens) and because of [Grave Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Pact) your opponents sacrifice *another* creature. Then everyone sacrifices a land. No worry. You have Nath and a couple of other Elves in play so you don't have to worry about sacrificing that land, but your opponents are in trouble... They have just lost two creatures, a card, and a more or less valuable land. It may not be so easy to play anything after one [Smallpox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox), and if they do—you have Elves to defend you and [Llanowar Augur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Augur) to sacrifice for another kill.

I don't know how this would work in practice, but it sure looks neat. (Though there's another, more intriguing, use of Nath later in this article—read on.)


Glen P. mentioned that [Doran, the Siege Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower) would be good as the General in an Elder Dragon Highlander deck, a format I should mention more:

### [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) (7 Votes)


The best thing by far about [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) in multiplayer? Its interaction with [Browbeat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Browbeat). "Sure, take five damage! That'll put five tokens into play. Oh, wait, you *wanted* me to draw three cards?" A lot of people mentioned this incidentally. They also mentioned that a white-red burn deck could combine [Purity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purity) with [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) to make life gain for you while making everyone miserable... but stuffing two six-mana, three-colored-mana dudes in the same deck seems a bit greedy to me.


That said, [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility)'s definitely up there. But is it the best? Well, take a look at this deck to see an interesting burn take:



> 
> As far as I see it, there are three different possibilities for [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) in a multiplayer deck. The first is in a straight-up multiplayer burn deck, the second a combo-style variant, usually centred around [Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium), and the third is simply running it as a one-of in any deck with [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake). The first two are tailor-made to specifically abuse the card, where as the third one uses the card for simple 'Supplies!' value.

> 
> I actually own this deck, and have been testing it *a lot* lately. It's undergone numerous builds, and this one is by far the best.
> 
> 
> The biggest problem I found in initial testing is that once you drop [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility), it instantly becomes the biggest target on the table—meaning unless you have a lot of mana, you won't ever get tokens as [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) won't live to see your next turn. (R.I.P. [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility))
> 
> 
> The solution I came with is to use pitch spells to damage my opponents the same turn [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) rears its ugly head/s, so I can easily beat at least one or two opponents in one game-swinging attack. Unless any surviving players have a miraculous answer up their sleeve ([Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod), [Powerstone Minefield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Powerstone+Minefield))—or happen to be cheating—they're dead the turn after. If they do, there's always a fist full of burn in your hand with their

> 
> 
> The deck packs a lot of burn and a lot of red card draw, and is capable of

> some extremely explosive turns.
> 
> 
> At heart, it is a burn deck packed for multiplayer, so the game plan really is simple—burn until you get [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility), then burn some more! Call it Aggro-Combo if you like.
> 
> 
> I've found the deck functions best in small to medium groups (three to six), as its late game is kinda weak when life gain effects start to show up and you fail to rip a [Cave-In](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cave-In) or [Flame Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Rift).
> 
> 
> At worst you will have the pleasure of knocking off several players by yourself and dropping everyone else perilously low before suiciding. This deck really, really speeds games up! We've had six-player games in the time it takes to boil a pot of water.

> Cards that didn't quite make the cut were [Acidic Soil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Soil) (it's too liable to kill you, so I swapped it for [Sizzle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sizzle)), [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) (too mana intensive—swapped for [Breath of Darigaaz](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breath+of+Darigaaz)), [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) ([Grinning Ignus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grinning+Ignus) chumps and pitches to [Cave-In](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cave-In) when needed) and [Fury of the Horde](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+of+the+Horde) (too narrow, not a source of burn).
> 
> [Sun Droplet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Droplet) would be great, but there's really not much room in here for it—I just want to maul people, and need as many cards to do so.
> 
> 
> The first time my playgroup saw this deck their jaws dropped to the floor after I'd wiped out all five of them by the sixth turn. I then managed to win the next three games by turn seven, before one of them made a noose out of his belt and casually pointed to the rafters.
> 
> 
> They're kind of used to it by now, and know how to play around it, but I still win most of the games I play with it. It's reached the point where a [Grinning Ignus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grinning+Ignus) is perceived as a bigger threat than an Akroma or [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus).
> 
> 
> [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility) is definitely the most powerful card in multiplayer because of the sheer explosive power and damage it can generate from nowhere. You might as well shove everyone else in a sack, hit it with a big stick several times, then set it on fire.

### [Liliana Vess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) (11 Votes)


Liliana had a lot of people excited, and why not? Her über-ability is something that *will* win you games... if it goes off. Unfortunately, she's also a large signal to your opponents about what's coming, and she takes time to build up to her big [Living Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death)-for-you effect (unless, yes, you use [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) to bring her into play with auto-revival). So in most games, bringing the Vess out means that everyone will turn to face you.


There is a way around it, though; she's an awesome finisher in a Mono-Black Deck, as many have noted:

Scott's deck is interesting because of the transmute ability of [Brainspoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainspoil) and the old-school loveliness of [Abyssal Gatekeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abyssal+Gatekeeper), but I'm not sold on the Zombie subtheme; it seems to interfere with the "destroy all critters" subtheme. Still, it's kind of neat.


Armon T., on the other hand, combined the blackness with the blueness to create an interesting hybrid. I'm not sure [Clockspinning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning) adds much here, since ideally you're in control anyway, but the [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter)s are quite nice. With a few more counterspells, this could be an interesting path to follow:

The problem with the Big L is that she doesn't encourage a whole lot of creativity in deck design. Almost anyone piloting creatures will *want* to kill her, so you're almost stuck putting her in a deck with lots of [Damnation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation)s, et cetera. That makes her powerful, but not very flexible.... and, arguably, not that much fun.

![Austere Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Austere+Command)

I think Gene G. put it very well here, arguing for [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command):


> 
> [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) arguably can be considered the best "answer" card ever printed for multiplayer. There is no other card in *Lorwyn* that will come close to having the impact [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) will have on multiplayer.
>

> The Top 10 Reasons [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) is the best multiplayer card in Lorwyn:
> 
> 
> 1. [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) gets better the more players you add. You can't say that for any other *Lorwyn* cards.
> 
> 
> 2. You don't need to build a deck around it. [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) can be added to any multiplayer deck (that contains the proper mana), and arguably make it a better deck. You can't say that for most other *Lorwyn* cards.
> 
> 
> 3. The more copies the merrier. Once you have the mana, you would probably be happy to draw four copies of the Command in a row. You probably wouldn't be happy to draw four copies of a planeswalker in a row.
> 
> 
> 4. [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) allows you to play with effects you otherwise wouldn't. For instance, if your deck is based around artifacts, you probably wouldn't include [Shatterstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatterstorm) in your deck. You also wouldn't be interested in [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod) effects if you have a tribal deck. [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) gives you the flexibility to include effects you otherwise couldn't find the space for.
>

> 5. [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) can deal with untargetable permanents, with surgical precision. Sure, I'll destroy your [Multani, Maro Sorcerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Multani%252C%2BMaro%2BSorcerer) as well as your two [Drill Skimmer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drill+Skimmer)s, while keeping my [Eladamri, Lord of Leaves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Eladamri%252C%2BLord%2Bof%2BLeaves) and company safe.

> 
> 6. [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) isn't very vulnerable. Permanents get nailed in multiplayer. None of the powerful permanents in *Lorwyn* are indestructible or untargetable. [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) is basically only vulnerable to [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) effects. **[or indestructible items, or regenerators – T.F.]**

You can build a plethora of decks around [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command); it isn't just an answer card in the strictest sense.

Okay, the situations he gives are a little iffy (and heavy on the usage of [Soul Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Sculptor)), but you get the idea. The only serious problem with [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) is that it doesn't hit planeswalkers, which could be a major loophole in today's environment. Then again, if you're looking to keep your own 'walkers safe, that could be a bonus.


And, of course, it has the usual drawback of potentially killing your own guys. Some folks tried to make decks with only creatures above or below a certain mana cost, but I think that's a mug's game; while weenies are nice, a weenie deck that can reliably get to six mana probably has too much land to lay down consistent threats, and a deck with all four-mana-plus guys has no early game.


(Though R.J.B. gets major points for reminding me of [No Rest for the Wicked](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=No+Rest+for+the+Wicked).)


The entries for [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) were interesting, since most of them didn't give decks, just descriptions of how awesome [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) is... and really, I can't blame them. A [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) effect is old hat, and a powerful one like this can slot into any number of White decks. It's flexible, and you don't have to tip your hand until you cast it. That's good.


The downside is that barring that mild flexibility, you're left with an [Akroma's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance) effect—which is very strong, but like [Liliana Vess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess), it doesn't particularly encourage creative deckbuilding. Troublesome, to say the least.


But there was one deck that did some neat things with, of all things, [Summoner's Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Egg):

### [Forced Fruition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forced+Fruition) (17 Votes)


The important thing about [Forced Fruition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forced+Fruition) is what it does not say: "When *you* play a spell." That's right; the FF only affects your opponents. This sounds like a drawback, but really when it's so easy to get decked by the Fruition (six or seven spells will do it for most people), hiding from its effect is a significant bonus. If your opponents aren't playing enchantment removal, this could get ugly.


Unfortunately, your opponents *will* be seeing all of their best spells if you're playing a [Forced Fruition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forced+Fruition) deck. So what's a man to do?


Let's just hear how others handled it—this next deck is a particularly interesting hybrid, so pay attention:



> 
> I have run this deck in Chaos Multiplayer with up to five players and it can get quite nasty, but I can see it working fairly well in Emperor and 2HG due to it working only when an opponent plays a spell.

> 
> 4 [Nath of the Gilt-Leaf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath+of+the+Gilt-Leaf) – used for its second ability, first ability useless in multiplayer  
> 
> 4 [Jagged-Scar Archers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jagged-Scar+Archers) – to account for any pesky fliers :D  
> 
> 4 [Imperious Perfect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect) ¬– Elves get BIGGER!!  
> 
> 4 [Liliana Vess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) – to make use of those overflowing graveyards, or to stop others from doing so  
> 
> 2 [Coat of Arms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coat+of+Arms) – for a bit of fun, very hard to use properly in multiplayer
> 
> 
> We are very strict, we play Standard Chaos Multiplayer so I have kept the Deck Standard legal. Although if you want to extend it, you can add 4 [Breeding Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool), 4 [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) at the very least...

> What happened the first couple of times I played this was that people didn't realise how potent it was for me that they drew cards, and declined to target the enchantment. Then they started having to discard down to seven at the end of every turn, and I got a flock of elves between passing the turn and my upkeep. I table the [Jagged-Scar Archers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jagged-Scar+Archers), and now fliers won't come near me. Admittedly, this deck suffers to [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod) or [Damnation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation), but its ability to just drop Elves on the table keeps that threat to a minimum.
> 
> Once people worked out the potency of the combo, they started running things like [Austere Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) and [Spring Cleaning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spring+Cleaning) (probably the card this deck fears the most, because it can destroy all enchantments, including the mana-fixing [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground)s, if it wins the clash). That's why I started to include a bunch of counter spells—but they only have a limited use in multiplayer, and have to be used on [Spring Cleaning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spring+Cleaning), even if it is targeting another player, which can be really annoying.
> 
> 
> I once had over forty Elves in play, after the combo was left untouched for two complete rounds of a five-way Chaos, I dropped a [Coat of Arms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coat+of+Arms) unmolested and swung at each of my opponents with 10 40+/40+s for the win in my sixth turn! We don't normally play that you can attack multiple people but we changed the rules this day and I used it to my advantage...
> 
> 
> This play would have to be up there with the highest amount of damage dealt in a single turn, that I have heard of. It totals over 1600 damage!
> 
> 
> That's my super damage story, and deck I used! Hope you like it!

> 
> The purpose of the deck is to drop out the Fruition out as soon as possible, usually via [Flash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash) & [Academy Rector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Rector), jump-starting the game. Each spell puts the player on a timer. [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) and [Prosperity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prosperity) are in the deck as a way to both accelerate to a way of dropping the Fruition out, as well as taking cards off of the opponent's decks, with [Brain Freeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze) as a finisher. If things become out of hand, it has the combination of [Caltrops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caltrops) and [Dovescape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dovescape) to stop most things that would ruin the gameplan.
> 
> 
> For aggro, it fuels those decks into getting the creatures to beat down the rest of the board. While the opponent is seeing [Kird Ape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape)s as a cantrip on steroids, you can watch their deck empty rather quickly as they flood the board at the other opponents, protecting their new "buddy." Of course, being the "buddy," you watch their deck dwindle to the point that a nice knife in the back finishes them off, that knife being a draw spell (i.e. [Prosperity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prosperity), [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius), [Braingeyser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braingeyser)) or a milling spell (such as [Brain Freeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze) or [Glimpse the Unthinkable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Unthinkable)).
> 
> 
> Combo really gets the hidden shaft of this card. Each spell played can be viewed as a way into accelerating into their own win, but a combo deck such as the age old [Enduring Renewal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Renewal) and [Goblin Bombardment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bombardment) decks find themselves in rough territory when each [Phyrexian Walker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Walker) / [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) they play brings them seven cards closer to decking. Granted, this is where it could also backfire and make you the target of a nasty [Kaervek's Torch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kaervek%27s+Torch) for 8,432,965,903,247,239, but it is almost an equal trade-off for the amount of people you take by surprise.
> 
> 
> [Forced Fruition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forced+Fruition) most puts the clamps on control, presenting the problem of now dealing with every deck accelerated on the board, putting it in a position it more than likely fears the most: being overwhelmed. As it has been said before, when you send a control deck back pedaling on your terms instead of its own, you are winning the battle. Not to mention, each spell that they do try and stop brings more cards off of two libraries.

STOP! HAMMER TIME.


No, wait—Ferrett time. Let's look at two excerpts here:



> 
> "While the opponent is seeing [Kird Ape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape)s as a cantrip on steroids, you can watch their deck empty rather quickly as they flood the board at the other opponents, protecting their new 'buddy'...."
> 
> 
> "What happened the first couple of times I played this was that people didn't realise how potent it was for me that they drew cards, and declined to target the enchantment..."
> 
> 
> 


In other words, we had two tables full of people who *didn't* think that being decked in a few spells would be troublesome. Hmm. Which means that once they do realize, the power of Fruition is significantly lessened, hmm?


Carry on....

> 
> [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), [Delay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delay), and the rarely used [Spellshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellshift) force opponents to replay spells, but with [Forced Fruition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forced+Fruition) out, it's an additional seven cards for each spell and that is quite costly when the deck is depleting fast. [Delay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delay) even forces opponents to play their spell, so they'll deck out faster even if they don't want to. [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) and [Delay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delay) also help you stay alive earlier in the game. [Evacuation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evacuation) is an instant speed field clearer. By bouncing every creature to players hands, life is safe and they'll have to spend many cards to cast them again. It is particularly useful is it's down to you and another player and you play this to start things off.
> 
> 
> [Copy Enchantment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copy+Enchantment) is included here because there are a whopping twelve other enchantments in the deck and all of them work equally well or even better in multiple copies. [Propaganda](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Propaganda) is an early card to halt or discourage attacks and it incredibly effective in multiple copies. [Sunken Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunken+Hope) is a fantastic card as it's continuous creature removal which is impossible to deal with if opponents just aren't packing enchantment removal.
> 
> 
> [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) decks opponents out while ensuring lands to play out [Forced Fruition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forced+Fruition) as soon as possible. [Prismatic Lens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens) accelerates into [Forced Fruition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forced+Fruition) and can be traded for a card when [Forced Fruition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forced+Fruition) gets played. [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) is an obvious inclusion here, being a powerful finisher.

Ross P. had, unfortunately, a spot-on parody of "Building on a Budget" entitled "Building on a Ferrett," but it was a little too long to keep here. Though it *was* awesome. Here's his decklist, though:
