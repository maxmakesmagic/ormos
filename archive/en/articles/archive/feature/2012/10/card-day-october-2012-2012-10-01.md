![Palliation Accord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Palliation+Accord)**[Palliation Accord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palliation+Accord)** – *Dissension* uncommon. "Palliation" is a real English word, derived from "palliate," to make a crime appear less serious. Even the Azorius are willing to cut a criminal a deal sometimes.
 


![Righteous Authority](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Righteous+Authority)**[Righteous Authority](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Righteous+Authority)** – *Return to Ravnica* rare. The symbols that surround the creature in the art for [Righteous Authority](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Righteous+Authority) also appear in the Azorius guild symbol. They're called "law runes" and were developed for *Return to Ravnica*.
 


![Isperia, Supreme Judge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Isperia%2C+Supreme+Judge)**[Isperia, Supreme Judge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isperia%2C+Supreme+Judge)** – *Return to Ravnica* mythic rare. Normally, sphinxes avoid getting involved in petty squabbles. But Isperia was convinced to become guildmaster of the Azorius after the dissolution of the Guildpact resulted in crime and chaos running rampant across Ravnica.
 


![Chub Toad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chub+Toad)**[Chub Toad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chub+Toad)** – *Ice Age* common. Back in the days of *Ice Age*, it was common for card names to contain hidden puns or references. [Chub Toad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chub+Toad) is an anagram of "Bad Touch," which has no greater significance than being a phrase people in R&D used to say a lot.
 


![Kukemssa Pirates](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kukemssa+Pirates)**[Kukemssa Pirates](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kukemssa+Pirates)** – *Mirage* rare. The flavor text for [Kukemssa Pirates](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kukemssa+Pirates) contains an excerpt from the "Love Song of Night and Day," a poem that's spread across seventeen cards in *Mirage* and *Visions*. Read the whole thing [here](/en/articles/archive/love-song-night-and-day-2003-04-14-0)!
 


![Batterhorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Batterhorn)**[Batterhorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterhorn)** – *Return to Ravnica* common. [Batterhorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterhorn) is kind of the Ravnican version of the phrase "A bull in a china shop." It's risky to have open-market bazaars when there are giant monsters wandering around the city.
 


![Haunted Crossroads](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Haunted+Crossroads)**[Haunted Crossroads](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Crossroads)** – *Mercadian Masques* uncommon. Traditionally, burying someone at a crossroads is supposed to keep them from rising from the grave. With [Haunted Crossroads](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Crossroads), that's been turned on its head. Which is actually another traditional way to keep people from rising from the grave!
 


![Jungle Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jungle+Patrol)**[Jungle Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Patrol)** – *Mirage* rare. When [Jungle Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Patrol) was first printed, the tokens it made had two creature types: Wall and Wood. The "Wood" part was moved to the tokens' name in the April 2010 Update Bulletin.
 


![Kitesail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kitesail)**[Kitesail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitesail)** – ***Magic** 2013* uncommon. [Kitesail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitesail)s can be seen in the art of several other cards, from the obvious ([Kitesail Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitesail+Apprentice)) to the surprising ([Kor Skyfisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Skyfisher)). On a plane as dangerous as Zendikar, it makes sense that people might feel safer off the ground.
 


![Seller of Songbirds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Seller+of+Songbirds)**[Seller of Songbirds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seller+of+Songbirds)** – *Return to Ravnica* common. [Seller of Songbirds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seller+of+Songbirds) provides a look at the everyday life of a guildless Ravnican citizen. Not everyone is a [Lich Lord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich+Lord) or a [Grand Arbiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Arbiter), you know!
 


![Chimney Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chimney+Imp)**[Chimney Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chimney+Imp)** – *Mirrodin* common. You think you're good at making decks? Mark Gottlieb once spent [an entire column](/en/articles/archive/impudence-2004-04-08) making decks that made good use of [Chimney Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chimney+Imp)!
 


![Hideous Laughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hideous+Laughter)**[Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter)** – *Champions of Kamigawa* uncommon. If you've ever wanted to see what it would look like if several ratfolk were driven mad by magic laughter, look no further than [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter).
 


![1598](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1598)**[Winds of Change](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1598)** – *Legends* uncommon. The flavor text on [Winds of Change](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winds+of+Change) comes from the days when real-world quotes were allowed on expansion cards. Ella Wheeler Wilcox was the poet who wrote, "Laugh, and the world laughs with you; Weep, and you weep alone."
 


![Towering Indrik](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Towering+Indrik)**[Towering Indrik](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Towering+Indrik)** – *Return to Ravnica* common. Indriks were first introduced in the original *Ravnica* block when [Indrik Stomphowler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indrik+Stomphowler) appeared in *Dissension*.
 


![Guttersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Guttersnipe)**[Guttersnipe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guttersnipe)** – *Return to Ravnica* uncommon. "Guttersnipe" is a real word for a child who lives in the streets, although it originally referred to an actual snipe (the bird) that picked through the trash in the gutters.
 


![Launch Party](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Launch+Party)**[Launch Party](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Launch+Party)** – *Return to Ravnica* common. A "Launch Party" used to be the weekend that a new **Magic** set went on sale. But now that's called the "Launch Weekend" and the promo card is tied to that weekend's Friday Night **Magic**. Otherwise this would have been the Card of the Day for last Friday!
 


![Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Syncopate)**[Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate)** – *Return to Ravnica* uncommon. [Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) got its name because it's a combination of [Power **Sink**](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Sink) and [Dissi**pate**](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate).
 


![Soul Tithe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soul+Tithe)**[Soul Tithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Tithe)** – *Return to Ravnica* uncommon. [Soul Tithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Tithe) is just the latest tithe-themed **Magic** card. In the past, players have been able to tithe [blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=blood), [mana](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=mana), and [nothing in particular](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=nothing+in+particular). There's even an Elephant Wizard who [enforces the tithing of spells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=enforces+the+tithing+of+spells)!
 


![25976](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=25976)**[Captain Sisay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=25976)** – *Invasion* rare. Sisay was the original captain of the *Weatherlight*, but when she was abducted by Volrath, Gerrard took over the ship to lead the crew on a rescue mission. These events formed the basis of the *Weatherlight* saga.
 


![Seed Spark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Seed+Spark)**[Seed Spark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seed+Spark)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* uncommon. [Seed Spark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seed+Spark) originally gave its caster X tokens, where X was the converted mana cost of the artifact or enchantment it destroyed. This turned out to be so good that people were afraid to play artifacts at all, so it was toned down a little.
 


![Seeds of Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Seeds+of+Strength)**[Seeds of Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeds+of+Strength)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* common. By saying "Target creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn" three times, [Seeds of Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeds+of+Strength) allows its caster to pick the same creature three times or split the bonus up between three different creatures. Or even give one creature +2/+2 and another +1/+1. This also applies to [Common Bond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Common+Bond)!
 


![Grove of the Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grove+of+the+Guardian)**[Grove of the Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Guardian)** – *Return to Ravnica* rare. When [Grove of the Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Guardian) is sacrificed, it replaces itself with an 8/8 green and white Elemental creature token with vigilance. To picture what this might look like, consider [Risen Sanctuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Risen+Sanctuary).
 


![Trostani, Selesnya's Voice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Trostani%2C+Selesnya%27s+Voice)**[Trostani, Selesnya's Voice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trostani%2C+Selesnya%27s+Voice)** – *Return to Ravnica* mythic rare. The triune dryad, Trostani, rules Selesnya. The Selesnyans, however, would say she is ultimately led by the will of Mat'Selesnya herself. Each of the three dryad identities that comprise Trostani embodies a particular Selesnya value. The left head is Life, the center head is Harmony, and the right head is Order.
