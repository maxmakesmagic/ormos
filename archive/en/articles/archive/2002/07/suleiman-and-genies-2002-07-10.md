Arabian Nights had no true five-card cycles, but two came really close.


There are four Djinns and four Efreets, one in each color except white. White is too orderly and pure to be home to one of the chaotic and unpredictable Arabian spirits.


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/global/images/mtgcom_arcana_135_pic1_en.jpg)*The four Djinns: [Serendib Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serendib+Djinn), [Juzam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juzam+Djinn), [Mijae Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mijae+Djinn), [Erhnam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erhnam+Djinn).  

The four Efreets: [Serendib Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serendib+Efreet), [Junun Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Junun+Efreet), [Ydwen Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ydwen+Efreet), [Ifh-Biff Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ifh-Biff+Efreet).*
Long-time players and collectors will remember that [Serendib Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serendib+Efreet) was reprinted in the English *Revised* edition with the illustration for [Ifh-Biff Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ifh-Biff+Efreet), one of our more classic blunders.


White did have one card related to Djinns and Efreets -- [King Suleiman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=King+Suleiman). The King tapped to destroy any Djinn or Efreet, and because he predated the invention of Legends, you can have more than one in play at a time.


The first (and only) white Djinn or Efreet appreared in *Invasion* -- [Ruham Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruham+Djinn).
