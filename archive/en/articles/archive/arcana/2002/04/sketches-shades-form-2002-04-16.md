Today's card is the *Torment* Enchant Creature [Shade's Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shade%27s+Form), illustrated by Clyde Caldwell. Clyde has been doing fantasy art for almost twenty years and has a large portfolio of book covers and trading cards to his name.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This card should show a person in the process of changing into a shade or disembodied spirit. This spirit should look creepy and the change should be caused by a spell."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Clyde. Clyde has a crisp, clean style reminiscent of older fantasy artists like Frank Frazetta and Roy G. Krenkel.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final piece.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today.
