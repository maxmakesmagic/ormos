The internet has been abuzz with some bothersome news recently, and I've gathered you all here today to confirm it. Yes, no matter how outlandish it may seem, the rumors are, in fact, true.

The Community Team has won the 2014 Community Cup! Congratulations! Someone needs to keep us sharp here at Wizards HQ and the Community Team proved they're the ones to do it. Hoist them onto your shoulders and raise them high, Community.


They say that the strong survive so, to recognize the Community Team's victory, everyone who logged into *Magic Online* during the 2014 Community Cup coverage (12:00 a.m. Friday, September 12 through 11:59 p.m. Sunday, September 14) will be granted [Survival of the Fittest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest). Players can expect to recieve their premium foil copy of [Survival of the Fittest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest) during the October 1 downtime.

Had the Community Team lost, everyone would be stuck with a [Zodiac Monkey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zodiac+Monkey) on their backs, so huzzahs all around!

The first event of the 2014 Community Cup was the *Vintage Masters* Booster Draft. Both teams dove into the musty vaults of *Magic*'s heritage to search out the choicest cards *Vintage Masters* has to offer.

*Khans of Tarkir* Challenge

[Top](#top)

The Community Team fought valiantly through round after round of Wizards Team juggernauts, thwarting us at every turn. With the 2014 Community Cup claimed, they prepared to journey into the sunset from whence they came. But wait! We had one last trick up our sleeves...


![](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/KTK_Logo_Reduced.png)
The *Khans of Tarkir* Pre-Prerelease! Could it be? Had this been the plan all along? Build the Community Team's trust in one another over the weekend, only to pull the rug of companionship right out from underneath them as the final, decisive blow?


Nah, that wasn't the plan at all. We just wanted to see what they thought of *Khans of Tarkir*. That would have been real devious though.
