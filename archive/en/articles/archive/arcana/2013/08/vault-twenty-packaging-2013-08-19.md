Releasing this Friday is this year's new *From the Vault: Twenty*. In case you missed it, we revealed the full contents of this box set in Gavin Verhey's ReConstructed [two weeks ago](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/259), where he talked about each of the twenty cards inside.

 Gavin went card by card and shared the deck it was from and the story around the card. From new [Fyndhorn Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fyndhorn+Elves) to [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) to, well, [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor)â€”this From the Vault, is awesome.
