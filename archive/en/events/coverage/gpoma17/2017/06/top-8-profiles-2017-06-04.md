It's way better than [Shrine of the Forsaken Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+the+Forsaken+Gods).


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker). It draws cards and makes lands desirable.

**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** I love all my sideboard cards equally, I would never choose only one.


**How did you prepare for the [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) matchup?** I decided to cast Ulamogs before my opponents.

**Hometown:** Rogers, Ar.


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:**  Grand Prix Montreal 2016 champion; Grand Prix Pittsburgh Top 8 (shout to Ryan).


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Temur Marvel, because I lost my win-and-in against Dan Fournier in Montreal and needed some revenge.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger). Just look at it.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker), because I don't actually think I can win a match of Constructed without it.


**How did you prepare for the [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) matchup?** Main deck three [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) and be willing take 4-5 hits from your opponent's [Rogue Refiner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue+Refiner) on the draw while your own creatures rot in your hand.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** Lock for 19 Pro Points. Winning the Quarterfinals would mean Silver.

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:**  Platinum Pro.


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel). It's the best.

**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Aether Meltdown](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Meltdown). I played against lots of [Longtusk Cub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longtusk+Cub)s and [Scrapheap Scrounger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapheap+Scrounger).


**How did you prepare for the [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) matchup?** I read some great strategy advice on [www.massdrop.com](http://www.massdrop.com/) while shopping for the latest in fashion apparel.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** I definitely adds to the sauce. But as the poet Gucci Mane says, sometimes you can get lost in the sauce.

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer). It hits hard and finds you what you need.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Transgress the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind). It's good against the fair and unfair Marvel plans.


**How did you prepare for the [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) matchup?** I didn't; I just hoped they didn't Ulamog me on their first spin.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** A step closer to Platinum hopefully!
