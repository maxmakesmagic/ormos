Our trip back to Zendikar wouldn't be complete without some changes to the Comprehensive Rulesâ€”have to make all those shiny new cards work, after all. We also made a small number of adjustments to existing cards in the Oracle database. This article will preview both sets of changes, with the one caveat that both sets of changes are still undergoing internal review, so what you read here may differ ever-so slightly from what gets finalized. When they're finalized, you can check them out on the [rules page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) and [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/). Let's dig in!
