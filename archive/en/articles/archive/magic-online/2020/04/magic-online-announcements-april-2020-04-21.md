*Magic Online* Super Qualifiers
-------------------------------


As part of our initiatives to give you [more ways to play at home](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/FNM_at_Home), we wanted to provide options for you to play at the highest levels for competitive stakes. Therefore, in light of the [changes to the tabletop Players Tour Qualifiers announced earlier](https://magic.gg/news/changes-to-qualifiers-for-players-tour-series-2-events-and-schedule), we're adding a new series of qualifiers to [*Magic Online*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/what-magic-online-magic-online-products-game-info) to provide additional ways for players to compete and qualify for upcoming Players Tour events: *Magic Online* Super Qualifiers. These online events will run alongside existing *Magic Online* Qualifiers and will continue to invite players to Players Tour Series 2 events.


And in order to make the Super Qualifiers as exciting as possible, we've added more prizes! Players who earn 65th place through 128th place will receive 100 Play Points. These prizes are in addition to those previously announced. And, because we intend this to be a quality of the Super Qualifier events as a whole, we're retroactively adding these to events that have already concluded! Players who earned these prizes will have them granted before the end of this week.

Showcase Qualifier Weekend

Players who earned entry into the Showcase Qualifier will be squaring off for an invitation to the Champions Showcase.

Each Showcase Qualifier is a scheduled Swiss-style event with a Top 8 playoff. The winner of each Showcase Qualifier earns a spot in the final Showcase event and a chance to earn their share of $70,000 and a tabletop Players Tour Finals invitation.
