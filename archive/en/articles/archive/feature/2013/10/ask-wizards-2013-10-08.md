Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks!


 **Q: How does Wizards balance a set? —Jamelle**  


**A: Mike McArtor, copyeditor for DailyMTG:**


A fun but huge question that we can't, unfortunately, answer in the space available here! But fear not, for the mighty Sam Stoddard has begun to answer this very question in his stint on the weekly column [Latest Developments](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/archive.aspx?tag=latest%20developments&description=latest%20developments)!


Some recent-ish articles that specifically address balancing sets include "[Balancing for Fun](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/245)," "[Core Developments for Standard](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/255)," and "[Limited Power Levels](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/253)."


But really, if you're interested in the hows and whys of card and set balancing, there's no better place to go than Latest Developments every week. If, however, you want to learn more about how specific sets are developed, [Erik Lauer](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Erik%20Lauer) and [Dave Humpherys](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Dave%20Humpherys) have written several features along those lines.
