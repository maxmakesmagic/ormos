As we've seen during past [theme weeks](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr133), red is about immediate gain, not about long-term loyalty. Allegiances are for white creatures. Forethought is for blue spells. **[Sokenzan Renegade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sokenzan+Renegade)**, on the other hand, is a red creature through and through.

![Sokenzan Renegade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sokenzan+Renegade)Consistent with the flavor emphasis of the Kamigawa block, [Sokenzan Renegade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sokenzan+Renegade)'s type line perfectly reflects his fickle but combat-skilled nature:

* He's an **Ogre**, obviously -- a traditionally red race.
* He's also a **Samurai**, reflecting his bushido ability and his red propensity to *smash*.
* Lastly he's a **Mercenary**, which is pure flavor. Mercenaries work for the highest bidder; and in the Renegade's case, he works for the wisest master (that is, the player with the biggest hand size).

His Mercenary status is interesting: as the only Mercenary in the Kamigawa block, it means he is the only creature in this block that combos with the [Masques Block Mercenaries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=mercenary&Field_Type=on&setfilter=MasquesBlock&colorfilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=44&y=16). He can be searched up by [Rathi Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Assassin) or [Cateran Summons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cateran+Summons) while getting pumped by [Nagao, Bound by Honor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nagao%2C+Bound+by+Honor). He can be revived by [Strongarm Thug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strongarm+Thug) after entering the Red Zone twice via [Godo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godo). A versatile 3/3 for 3 mana -- as long as you pay his fee.
