Nothing clarifies a field of competition like a little by-the-numbers arranging. Our scientists have cracked the alphanumeric code that hides the contents of the Day 2 players' decks, and as a companion piece to their full lists provide this breakdown.

**Mono-Black Control - 24**

![Cabal Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cabal+Coffers)You want to talk dominance? Consider the fact that a third of the successful players are running the same deck. There's a lot of posturing going on, mixing up numbers of swamps and [Cabal Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Coffers), and switching of key cards between the main deck and sideboard. There's a trend to a more creature-heavy build that takes advantage of [Faceless Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher) during Game 1, and this is taken to its logical conclusion by Paul Rietzl's deck, which pre-boards Braids.**Blue-Green Madness - 7**

These decks share the same core of madness dudes and enablers, but differ over finesse cards like [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop), [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion), and [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation). 

**[Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval)-Infestation - 7**

Most of the disagreement between these powerhouses is over the mana base. There's a lot of spells that need to be played early on, so balancing [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s, [Darkwater Catacombs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkwater+Catacombs), [Tainted Isle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Isle)s and islands is of utmost importance. Beyond the backbone of the combo and the tools to survive to get there you'll find narrower cards like [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion), [Coffin Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coffin+Purge), and Kenny Hsiung's [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) - [Peek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peek) duo.

![Grizzly Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grizzly+Fate)**Blue-Green Speculation - 5**Fronted by Canadian strongarm pair Gab "The Juggernaut" Tsang and the irrepressible David Rood and their no-nonsense version, these decks range to decks more dedicated to threshold and [Grizzly Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Fate). All of them draw strength from the raw tutoring power that is [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation).

**Green-White Madness - 4**

Amateur Matthew Schempp ripped up the field with his Gloried beasties, abusing the speed at which his deck churns out the pain. Weenies ensure that mono-black won't have enough Edicts to stop [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur).

**Three-Color [Mirari's Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake) - 3**

Eugene Harvey heads up the group that took OBC's king combo deck forward to greatness. Patrick Chapin and his four-color version had to watch from the sidelines.

**Blue-Green Threshold - 3**

![Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phantom+Centaur)Ultra-fast and efficient beats leave little room for grace in this tight little package.**Punisher - 2**

The Scandanavian powerhouse fell flat this weekend, outshined by newer designs

**Hybrid Blue-Green - 2**

These decks sit on the fence between madness and Speculation.

**And The Rest - 5**

The under-represented amounted to a Blue-Black Braids, Huey's Red-Black Sorcery Special, Red-Green Beatdown (!), White-Red Beatdown (!!), and Dave Williams, running the Pirates deck from Grand Prix - London. Williams, in particular, seems set up to run the field.
