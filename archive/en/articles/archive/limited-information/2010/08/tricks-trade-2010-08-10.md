If your opponent is attacking you with a [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), and you have a [Hoarding Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hoarding+Dragon) on defense, then you can call on a lot of different tricks to take care of the extremely threatening mythic rare. But you better be ready with a [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn), a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), a [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Giant%2BGrowth)-like effect (or two) or else you aren't going to have much time to try to get back in the game.

Heck, even if you have that key trick that you need to deal with the attacking 6/6, you might not be able to overcome the four 2/2 creatures that your opponent made with his or her [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan). 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li103_gameState.jpg)  
In the [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) situation it doesn't really matter what kind of trick you have—you just have to have something, anything really, that can affect combat in a relevant way. The important thing is that you have one. But often times, the trick that you have, or don't have, can change the situation in a very big way.

Different situations call for very different kinds of tricks. That [Safe Passage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safe+Passage) that was an absolute all-star when your opponent tried to [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) away your two best creatures, won't do all that much when your opponent has the board locked up with a bunch of [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider)s and is whacking away at your life total with an evasion creature.

Meanwhile, that [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) that you used to deal your opponent the killing blow last game won't be all that great if you are staring at a [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) while your opponent attacks you with his or her 4/4. However, that [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) which you decided to sideboard out would be just the thing that you would need to take down your opponent's 4/4 and have your [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) live to tell the tale.

While we don't have enough time to go too deep into the combat implications of all of the common and uncommon tricks in M11, we can at least explore how they should affect your base level thinking.

### Squawk!

A lone [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) isn't all that impressive. A 1/1 flyer for two mana is the kind of card that you might play if you are desperately searching for that last card to fill out your deck, you have a weak curve, or you have a ton of auras and equipment and you really want some more evasion creatures to put them on.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li103_hawk.jpg)  
But when you are able to search up another copy of [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), it becomes a very reasonable card to include. And once you can fetch up a second and a third copy of the 1/1 flyer, you will (usually) be very happy to have them in your deck.

Once you have those three 1/1 flyers, you can comfortably trade them one at a time for [Stormfront Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus)es (or is that Pegasi?) and [Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker)s. If you have to trade two of your three [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s for a [Vulshok Berserker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker), you are still getting a fine deal because you only invested one physical card to get your three hawks. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li103_hawks.jpg)  
Even if you use a [Mighty Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap) to have one of your [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s trade with a [Fire Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+Servant), you are still coming out pretty well in the exchange because you have only spent one-and-one-third of a card to deal with one of your opponent's best creatures. 

But these types of exchanges don't really take advantage of the fact that you just cast three 1/1 flyers. To really take advantage of your [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s you need a card that interacts with all of your creatures, something like [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), or ...

### Inspired Charge

[Inspired Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspired+Charge) isn't always a great card. Yes, you can win multiple combats in a single turn with it, or overrun your opponents, or do any number of impressive things with it.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li103_charge.jpg)  
But for four mana, you are paying quite a bit for your combat trick. You won't be able to leave the mana and the creatures up to make it effective without telegraphing it very loudly. 

![Inspired Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Inspired+Charge)  
It goes without saying that you should be aware of any opponent who leaves four mana open and an inordinate number of creatures on defense—there is probably a pretty devastating trick waiting in the winds.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li103_bell.jpg)*If your opponent leaves a bunch of mana open and a bunch of creatures untapped, your alarm bells better start ringing.*  
If your curve is on the higher end of things, you might not even end up playing any of the [Inspired Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspired+Charge)s that you see.

But if you have a fairly aggressive deck with three copies of [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), then [Inspired Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspired+Charge) becomes the kind of card that you should actively seek out.

### Condemn

Like many tricks, [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn)'s effectiveness can go way down if your opponent thinks that you have it in your hand. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li103_condemn.jpg)  
If you have a [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel), and you think your opponent has a [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn), then it will make a lot of sense for you to hold back with your 4/4 flyer that protects you from losing. 

![Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Condemn)  
Heck, even if you don't have something as impressive as a [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel), if you are in a tight race—but you don't have too many creatures in reserve, it is often worth it to hold back your biggest creature rather than attack with it. 

Sure your opponent's [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) will eventually nab one of your best creatures, but if [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) is a card that is on your radar you can generally make sure that you don't get blown out in a race because of it.

### Safe Passage

[Safe Passage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safe+Passage) has the potential to create some of the biggest blowouts imaginable. Your opponent goes to cast [Destructive Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Force) to clear the board of everything other than his [Earth Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earth+Servant), which will just barely survive. But wait—you have the [Safe Passage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safe+Passage) to save your army of creatures and practically end the game on the spot.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li103_safePassage.jpg)  
Then there are the times that [Safe Passage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safe+Passage) is used to save one of your creatures in an innocuous combat—(actually, my [Canyon Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur) won't trade with your [Barony Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barony+Vampire), I'll [Safe Passage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safe+Passage)).

And then there are the times that [Safe Passage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safe+Passage) just kind of clogs up your hand while other, far more relevant, things happen. Eventually you'll have to use it to [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog), or save one of your barely relevant creatures. 

![Safe Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Safe+Passage)  
[Safe Passage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safe+Passage) is definitely a good card, and there are times when it will almost single-handedly win you the game, but it is conditional enough that you don't want to pick it too early or put too many of them in your deck.

### Unsummon

I love having an [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) in my deck. It's extremely easy to leave a blue mana open to keep your opponents best creature off the board for a turn, permanently deal with an aura, fizzle a [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth), or save your best creature from a removal spell.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li103_unsummon.jpg)  
You don't want to fill your deck up with too many [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon)s as they ultimately cost you a physical card, but if you can get one or two they should be more than welcome additions to your deck.

### Lightning Bolt, Doom Blade and Chandra's Outrage

It's hard to say too many good things about cards like [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) and [Chandra's Outrage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage). If you see one of these cards in your pack, you probably want to take it. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li103_3Cards1.jpg)  
They're versatile and incredibly effective.

They slice, and they dice!

They kill, and they thrill!

Etc.

### Fling

When played correctly in the right deck, [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) is an extremely powerful burn spell that has the potential to do so much more than a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) ever could. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li103_fling.jpg)  
Have you ever cast [Act of Treason](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) on your opponent's best creature, attacked with it and then used a [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) to either kill your opponent's second best creature, or just kill your opponent outright? 

![Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fling)  
I have. And let me tell you, it not only feels great, it also tends to put you disturbingly ahead on the board.

When played poorly, [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) is a good way to spend two cards to kill a creature

If you think your opponent might have a [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling), try to hold off on using your removal spells until your opponent is tapped low. By the same notion, if you have a [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) and you think your opponent is getting ready to use a removal spell, you want to do everything you can to leave two mana open so you can throw your would be killed creature at your opponent's top guy.

### Thunder Strike and Mighty Leap

+2 power isn't a huge boost for a creature to get for two mana. If a pump spell were going to give my creature +3, +4, or +more power, then I would put it in my deck knowing that there would be a good chance that I would use it to help me deliver the finishing blow to unsuspecting opponents.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Thunder Strike | Mighty Leap |

While [Thunder Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunder+Strike) can still help you deliver those final few points of damage to your opponent every now and again, its true strength is in helping you win creature combats. If you are put into a combat between two creatures that are even remotely close in power, then a single [Thunder Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunder+Strike) will usually be enough for you to win the combat outright.

Taking down one of your opponents four-, five- or even six-drops for the low, low cost of two mana is nothing to sneeze at

[Thunder Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunder+Strike) is the kind of card that you can pick up really late in the draft. If you can tell that you are going to be a bit light on tricks, then you can practically bank on getting that [Thunder Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunder+Strike) that you saw third-pick when the pack comes back around.

[Mighty Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap) is similarly easy to pick up, and while it isn't quite as good at winning creature combats as [Thunder Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunder+Strike), it has an easier time allowing you to swing in for those last couple of points of unblockable damage.

### Fog

At the rock-bottom price of a single green mana, [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) has been preventing a turn's worth of combat damage since *Alpha*. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li103_fog.jpg)  
While [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) isn't the kind of card that you usually want to main-deck, or even one that you will often want to sideboard in, if you think that you are going to get into some really tight races then it might be time for that old [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) to come out and shine again.

### Giant Growth

The most classic combat trick known to man, [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) has been around for as long as **Magic** has. You need to be careful with your [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth)s if you think that your opponent has a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), a [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), or an [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon). But if you find a good opportunity to give your creature +3/+3, you can set yourself up for some very attractive combats.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li103_growth.jpg)  
And let's not even begin to get into what happens if your opponent has an [Ice Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage) on one of your creatures and you are ready with a [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth).

### Diminish

[Diminish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminish) is another solid combat trick, but it is just conditional enough that you don't want to take it with any of your earliest picks.

![Diminish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Diminish)  
### Hornet Sting and Stabbing Pain

Of course you would rather have a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) or a [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) than a [Hornet Sting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Sting), or a [Stabbing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stabbing+Pain), but that doesn't mean that you should run in the opposite direction every time you see one of these one-casting-cost removal spells.

While [Hornet Sting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Sting) and [Stabbing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stabbing+Pain) will pretty much never be the best card for the job—that title belongs to all-star cards like [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), or situational cards like [Diminish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminish) or [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon)—[Hornet Sting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Sting) and [Stabbing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stabbing+Pain) are often good enough to get the job done. 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Hornet Sting | Stabbing Pain |

If you need to kill a [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) on turn one, [Hornet Sting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Sting) is there. If you need to get rid of a [Stormfront Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus) before it starts clobbering you for 2 a turn, it's time to look to [Stabbing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stabbing+Pain). If you don't want to get walloped by that Awakener-Druid-enabled 4/5 land, then you better hope that you have a removal spell ready—and that removal spell might as well be [Hornet Sting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Sting).

No matter the draft, I wouldn't spend an early pick on either [Hornet Sting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Sting) or [Stabbing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stabbing+Pain), and I wouldn't feel obligated to play it in my main deck either, but if I have the opportunity to pick up a one-casting-cost removal spell on the cheap, I will certainly do so. 

Even if I am only brining in my [Hornet Sting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Sting) for a couple of games against an opponent who has an aggressive white deck, it will have been worth the pick.

### Combust, Celestial Purge, Naturalize and Plummet

[Combust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust) and [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge) are both excellent main deck inclusions for most decks.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Combust | Celestial Purge |

The majority of your opponents will be playing at least one of the relevant colors making these two-casting-cost removal spells more than worth it.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Naturalize | Plummet |

Like [Combust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust) and [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge), [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) and [Plummet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet) are only good if your opponent has the right targets. However, unlike [Combust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust) and [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge), [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) and [Plummet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet) are usually better left in your sideboard. When [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) and [Plummet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet) are good, they tend to be excellent—but there are too many times when they are dead to warrant play in most starting forty.
