- ### Round 10 Feature Match - (7) Samuel Black vs. Gerard Fabiano

*by Mike Rosenberg*
  
 Both No. 7 Ranked Player Samuel Black and Gerard Fabiano were coming into Day Two in good shape. Both players had 8-1 records and both had decks that were full of powerful cards. While Fabiano was looking for a fast start with his aggressive white-red deck, Black had a number of powerful blue and green cards, including some blue disruption and some massive creatures like [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp). 

Who would continue on with only a single loss? 

The Games
 Black was first to act with [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad). "How have you not played anything yet?" he asked Fabiano, who sat with an untapped Plains and Mountain. Fabiano obliged him with a hasty [Minotaur Skullcleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Skullcleaver) on the third turn, which promptly traded with the Dryad when Black blocked. [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) stopped [Purphoros's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%27s+Emissary) in its tracks on the next turn, and Black fired back with [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) and [Ordeal of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Nylea) on the flying creature. 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/events/gptor13/r10_black.jpg)*No. 7 Ranked Player Samuel Black*  
 Fabiano did not have removal for the [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin), but he did have [Ray of Dissolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Dissolution) to take out the Ordeal. Black pressed on by attacking with his [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) before adding [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) to the board. Fabiano, however, was stuck with a load of combat tricks in hand but no creatures with which to cast, a [Borderland Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Minotaur) stranded in his hand due to lacking the necessary second Mountain to cast it. Black continued to improve his board with [Nylea's Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple). 

 He finally found a creature he could cast, [Spearpoint Oread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spearpoint+Oread), and [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) stopped Black's Fade Into Antiquity before his [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) attacked in. When Fabiano added [Leonin Snarecaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Snarecaster) to his board and passed with mana up and creatures untapped, Black just sent in his [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) and [Nylea's Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple), losing the latter creature to a mid-combat [Coordinated Assault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coordinated+Assault). Black cast a post-combat [Horizon Scholar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Scholar), then passed back to Fabiano, who had two more [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing)s, a [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), and the stranded [Borderland Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Minotaur) in his hand. 

 Attacks dropped Fabiano to 6 after he blocked the [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) and used [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) to save his creature, but Black had another behemoth in Volpine Goliath. While Fabiano now had a window to take out [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) with [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), he was dead in the air on the next turn. 

 The second game started out a lot better for Fabiano, who had a second-turn [Akroan Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Crusader), and was met with no resistance when he cast [Ordeal of Purphoros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Purphoros) on it during the next turn, dropping Black to 17 between the token and the now 2/2 red creature. [Nessian Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser) came down and blocked the 1/1 token on the next turn, meeting its fate to [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) before Black fell to 14. This signaled [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) on the [Akroan Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Crusader) which Black immediately cast when he untapped, a play that stranded Fabiano on drawing any lands the next turn. He simply re-cast his one mana creature as he sputtered on a Mountain and Plains, and was met with a huge wall in the form of [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp). 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/events/gptor13/r10_fabiano.jpg)*Gerard Fabiano*  
[Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) on upkeep at Black found Fabiano no lands, and Black had his own upkeep spell with [Horizon Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Chimera) before the Asp attacked in. Another Magmet Jet on upkeep disposed of the Chimera, but again Fabiano did not find the Plains he was looking for to enable his [Phalanx Leader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader) and [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) to be cast. Meanwhile, Black continued playing monsters with [Horizon Scholar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Scholar). 

 Fabiano cast [Minotaur Skullcleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Skullcleaver) sent in his team, and Black blocked the [Akroan Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Crusader), falling to 7. However, Black's board proved to be insurmountable, and he conceded on the next turn. 

Black 2 – Fabiano 0 

 "I just needed him to not have [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide)," Fabiano said after the match. His hand was powerful, but the [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) ensured that his first plan would not only sputter, but it also denied him the double white he needed to cast his grip of powerful white creatures.

- ### Round 11 Feature Match - Mark Lovin vs. Seth Manfield

*by Josh Bennett*
  
The Story
The lightning-strike amateur Mark Lovin with defensive Blue-White against the journeyman pro Seth Manfield playing red-black aggro.

Lovin was a competitive amateur back in the early 2000s, but heeded the call of Grad School in 2006. His last event was Grand Prix Toronto in that year, his first Grand Prix Day 2 that lead to a Top 4 finish. He's made his second Day 2, and is looking to make this a repeat performance.

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/events/gptor13/r11_lovin.jpg)*Mark Lovin*  
 Seth Manfield already has a pair of Grand Prix titles to his name. Last weekend at Albuquerque he got the PT point he needed to hit Silver Status, guaranteeing him a Pro Tour invite. Right now his eyes are on a Top 8 here in Toronto, which would qualify him for Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* in Valencia, and allow him to keep his Silver invitation for the following Pro Tour. 

The Match
 Game one was quick and brutal. Lovin kept a two-land hand on the draw with no early plays. A turn-two [Akroan Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Crusader) followed by [Scourgemark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourgemark) gave Manfield the early pressure he needed. Lovin hit his third land and decided to play out [Spear of Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spear+of+Heliod), accepting an extra turn of pain. Manfield dropped him to thirteen and played out [Purphoros's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%27s+Emissary). [Lagonna-Band Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lagonna-Band+Elder) got the life back, but was dispatched by [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) and Manfield's creatures crashed in. Lovin was stuck on three lands and couldn't add enough to the board to stem the tide. 

Manfield 1 - Lovin 0

 Game two looked like it was more in Lovin's favor, despite a mulligan to six. He played out a wall of [Yoked Ox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yoked+Ox), [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker) and Travelling Philosophers, forcing Manfield's army of 2/1's to stay home. Next came a bestowed [Nimbus Naiad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad) on the Philosophers, giving Lovin a flying 4/4 to take chunks out of Manfield's life total. [Insatiable Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insatiable+Harpy) from Manfield was met by a [Coastline Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coastline+Chimera), and now it seemed that Manfield's only route to victory was his [Tymaret, the Murder King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tymaret%2C+the+Murder+King). 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/events/gptor13/r11_manfield.jpg)*Seth Manfield*  
 Manfield added [Purphoros's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%27s+Emissary) to his board, stuck on just four land. Lovin decided to go for the throat. He flew in with both Philosophers and Chimera for five, then dispatched the Murder King with [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath). Unfortunately for him, that all played right into Manfield's hands. [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) removed the [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker), leaving Lovin with just the 0/4 Ox on defence. Manfield sent the whole team, dealing 8 damage and losing nothing. Lovin was down to ten. Then came the final nail: A second Tymaret! 

Now Lovin had to hold back, but Manfield had inevitability on his side. Between attacks and sacrificed creatures, he made short work of Lovin. 

The Aftermath
The two players talked briefly about the match before wishing each other good luck with the rest of the day. The shared a laugh about the outrageous second Tymaret.

  
 "When you [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath)ed I was so happy because I already had the other one in hand," said Manfield 

"Yeah, I felt like I had to though-" began Lovin, but Manfield cut him off, saying "Oh no you absolutely had to, it was just super lucky for me."

- ### Round 12 Feature Match - William Jensen vs. Frank Skarren

*by Mike Rosenberg*
  
 2013 Hall of Famer William Jensen and Grand Prix Charlotte Champion Frank Skarren both had brutally powerful decks that propelled them through the first two rounds of the first draft with two wins each. While Skarren had a traditional blue-black deck with plenty of anti-aggro options and some potentially powerful curves involving [Disciple of Phenax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax) and [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), Jensen had a less traditional multi-color deck that is capable of hitting its necessary colors with multiple copies of [Nylea's Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Presence). 

 Would blue-black take down their first pod, or would [Nylea's Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Presence) guide the Hall of Fame member to victory instead? 

The Games
[Nylea's Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Presence) was Jensen's first play, giving him some mana fixing, while Skarren led with [Baleful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Eidolon), starting the game with only six cards. Jensen had a second Presence on the third turn, and revealed three colors when he played an Island to go with his Forests and Swamp when he cast [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) on the fourth turn. 

[Disciple of Phenax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax) revealed what was going on when Jensen revealed three of his five cards: [Pharika's Cure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure), [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide), and [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). "Nothing much," Jensen said. 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/events/gptor13/r12_jensen.jpg)*William Jensen*  
 "Five-Color Green?" Skarren asked. "I was five-color green fourteen years ago," Jensen retorted with a smile. [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) hit the bin and play passed back to Jensen, who used [Pharika's Cure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure) on the [Baleful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Eidolon). The [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) attacked in and a [Reverent Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter) came after that, entering as a 5/5 creature. [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) gave Skarren a life swing, but [Keepsake Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keepsake+Gorgon) from Jensen put the Grand Prix Charlotte Champion on the back pedal. [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock) from Skarren cleared away the Gorgon and bought some time against Jensen's powerful deck. 

 A second [Disciple of Phenax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax) nabbed a [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) a turn later, but Jensen was racing. His [Reverent Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter) and [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) gave him a serious clock that Skarren had to contend with. The race tipped into Jensen's favor when he had a second [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) for the [Horizon Scholar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Scholar). A bestowed [Nylea's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary) on the [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) a turn later was enough for Skarren to pack it in. 

 Skarren had the first action of the second game with a second-turn [Returned Phalanx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Phalanx) and third-turn [Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn). This accelerated a fourth turn [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) into play, which drained Jensen for 3 when it came in. Jensen had some action of his own on the third turn however with [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr). A Mountain revealed that Jensen had four colors in his deck, and he passed back. 

[Disciple of Phenax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax) revealed all but one card from Jensen's hand: Forest, Swamp, Swamp, [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock), and [Lash of the Whip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+of+the+Whip). He discarded the Lash, then sent in his team, losing [Returned Phalanx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Phalanx) to the [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr). However, Jensen's unrevealed card was [Pharika's Mender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Mender), bringing back his dead [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr). 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/events/gptor13/r12_skarren.jpg)*Frank Skarren*  
 The Mender halted attacks from Skarren, who deployed [Blood-Toll Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Toll+Harpy). Jensen now had the turn to go on the offensive, attacking for 4 before casting [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp). Skarren, however, was finding himself on the receiving end of some mana flood, as he was out of any spells to cast. Suddenly, the game reversed into Jensen's favor. 

 Jensen sent his big green creatures in after playing his seventh land. Skarren chump blocked the Asp with [Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn), falling to 14. That quickly became 12 when [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock) disposed of the Gray Merchant. 

 Skarren drew into [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock), and he quickly used it to dispose of the Asp after attacking with his remaining creatures. He passed back to Jensen, having knocked the Hall of Famer down to 9. Jensen dug with [Nylea's Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Presence), then bestowed [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) onto [Pharika's Mender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Mender), dropping Skarren to 4. 

 Skarren continued his attacks, dropping Jensen to 6. He added [Felhide Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felhide+Minotaur) to his board, then passed with one in hand. Jensen drew, then thought for a minute. He decided to go for lethal, bestowing [Nylea's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary) onto [Pharika's Mender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Mender). That was enough to earn the handshake from Skarren. 

Jensen 2 – Skarren 0

- ### Sunday, 2:47 p.m. - Family Matters

*by Mike Rosenberg*
  
The family that plays together, stays together. This is particularly true during the pool registration and deck building portion of a Limited Grand Prix, when I was informed of a group of five competitors in today's Grand Prix sitting together during the registration and build phase of the event. 

The one thing they had in common was a family name: Goldfarb. 

Father, brother, son, son, and niece had shown up to compete in what may be the largest family gathering I've ever seen at a Grand Prix. 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/events/gptor13/goldfarb_family.jpg)*The Goldfarb family (left to right): Matthew, Howard, David, Gary, Tracy*  
The Goldfarb family in attendance today consists of five players: father Howard Goldfarb, sons David and Matthew Goldfarb, brother Gary Goldfarb, and then finally Tracy Goldfarb, Gary's daughter. 

 This is both Gary and Tracy's first Grand Prix, but for Howard and his sons, it's far from their first rodeo. "[Gary] has only been playing **Magic** for about two years since we took him to Gen Con two years ago," Howard confirmed. 

 Howard and his sons, however, have been playing for about a decade. While Matthew got started during *Onslaught* block, Howard and David got into **Magic** during the original *Mirrodin* block, and the father and sons have been playing the game ever since. The artifact block that first sparked the father ands on's interest also has a resonance of nostalgia for Howard especially. "That's why I like artifacts, and it's why I play Affinity in Modern and Legacy," Howard said. 

"I play very sporadically. I play a couple of times a year," Howard said. "We only play Prereleases, PTQs, Grand Prix events, and at Gen Con together," said his son, David. "We only play big events together."

Typically, the family only attends events together a few times a year. These events are primarily prereleases and occasionally Pro Tour Qualifiers in the local area, but Howard has made the trip to a few Grand Prix events as well. This weekend marked Howard's third Grand Prix, and it was David's fourth. 

 The last year has been relatively good for the Goldfarb family from a **Magic** standpoint as well. Matthew won a Pro Tour Qualifier that got him an invitation and airfane to Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze* back in March. His dad joined him on the trip to San Diego where he got to play in his first Pro Tour. 

David has also seen some recent success with a Top 32 finish at Grand Prix Detroit, as well as on the independent circuits. 

 Out of the five family members, only one Goldfarb is carrying the torch into Day Two's *Theros* Booster Draft: David, with a 7-2 record. Despite not liking his first draft deck of the morning, he has a game plan and is hoping to win out, not for a chance at Top 8, but for a chance to play in Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*. "I don't really care about the Top 8. I just want to get onto the Pro Tour," said David.

- ### Sunday, 2:50 p.m. - Sam Black - Draft 1

*by Josh Bennett*
  
It seems like everywhere you go, people in the know are saying "Sam Black, so hot right now... Sam Black."

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/events/gptor13/black_draft.jpg)The awed whispers have it right. Never mind that he's the Number 7 Ranked Player. In Black's last four major events, he's made Top 8 all four times. It's an incredible run, and Black shows no signs of slowing down. He came into Day 2 with a comfortable 8-1 record, and sat down to his first draft of the day.

 The draft kicked off without fireworks. Black's first two packs were lukewarm affairs, and he took [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) followed by [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide). The third had no blue cards at all, and nothing amazing in the other colors. He settled on [Lagonna-Band Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lagonna-Band+Elder), passing along [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock), Kragma Warlord and [Flamespeaker Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamespeaker+Adept). Things got a little brighter with a fourth-pick [Voyage's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End), but then came another dud pack, and Black took [Dragon Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle) over [Steam Augury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Augury). The signals were anything but clear. He wound up getting a late [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr) and an [Ordeal of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Nylea), tabling Fade Into Antiquity and [Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn) before pack's end. 

 Black's situation was less than ideal. He had a few good blue cards, and a smattering of cards in green and red. He was certainly not in black. Still, when he opened [Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver) and [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) he didn't take too long to decide on the Planeswalker. He followed it up with a string of powerful green cards - [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr), [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad), [Nylea's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary), [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp). There wasn't much blue to speak of, save for a [Horizon Scholar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Scholar) late in the pack. 

 Heading into the final pack he was solidly blue-green, with Unicorn and [Traveler's Amulet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveler%27s+Amulet) to splash his Ashiok. Again, the packs seemed to be low in quality cards. Still he picked up a few goodies, including [Horizon Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Chimera), a pair of [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker)s and a [Nessian Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser). 

That was how it looked from the outside. I sat down with Black to get his commentary on how it had gone and some of the key decisions.

 Pick 3: Faced with no blue cards, Black was underwhelmed by his options. None of these cards would give him direction, he said. He took the Elder mostly because blue-white would be the best place to end up. He said it was possible he should have taken [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock), knowing that Gerard Fabiano two seats to his right often drafts aggressive decks, but not necessarily. 

 Pick 5: [Dragon Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle) over [Steam Augury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Augury). "At this point, knowing I'm going to be playing blue, the one card I'm thinking of is [Wavecrash Triton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wavecrash+Triton)." Mantle does a lot of work in blue-red. 

 Pick 6: "The late [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr) is a strong signal, and to get [Ordeal of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Nylea) next [the second he'd seen, he took [Voyage's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End) over the first] reinforced that. It's the worst Ordeal, but it's still an Ordeal." 

End of Pack 1: Black wound up playing the Fade Into Antiquity he got late, but wasn't thrilled about doing so. Being sorcery speed is a very real cost. Black was mentally settled in Blue-Green, and was conscious of his shortness of good playables.

 Pack 2 Pick 1: "[Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) vs Ashiok was a VERY difficult pick. After pack 1 I knew I was short on cards, so it's risky to turn down a card that will definitely make my maindeck. On the other hand, I didn't have any high-impact cards. Ashiok would give me that." Having the Unicorn already, and with green offering [Nylea's Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Presence), splashing Ashiok wouldn't take too much work. 

 Pack 2 Pick 3: [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad) over [Triton Tactics](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Tactics). "[Triton Tactics](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Tactics) is very good in blue-green, but Dryad gave me a two-drop that can trigger heroic. Again, I'm still looking for [Wavecrash Triton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wavecrash+Triton). I never saw one all draft." 

 Pack 2 evauation: "I had about fifteen playables with a couple possibles, so I was a little under where I'd like to be. What that meant was that I couldn't prioritize taking sideboard cards that are very powerful in their matchup, things like [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay), [Hunt the Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunt+the+Hunter), [Shredding Winds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shredding+Winds) and [Benthic Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benthic+Giant)." 

Overall, Black was satisfied with his draft. "I feel I was definitely in the right colors, and I think my deck is very good." I asked him if he thought 3-0 was a possibility, and he said "Oh, definitely."

Well he was right. He dropped Gerard Fabiano, GP Calgary finalist Stephane Gerard, and Kai Burnett to sweep his pod, setting himself up for a run at Top 8.

- ###  Sunday, 5:42 p.m. - Draft Feature - William Jensen

*by Mike Rosenberg*
  
 2013 Hall of Fame member and Grand Prix Oakland 2013 Champion William Jensen is one of the most experience players in the room, and he's been showing why he has such an impressive resume in the game this weekend. Following an 8-1 performance during Day One's Sealed Pack rounds, Jensen went on to 3-0 his first *Theros* Booster Draft of the day with a powerful multi-color deck featuring a green base with multiple copies of [Nylea's Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Presence). 

The result of his draft was a deck that contained one powerful card after another, all of which were relatively easy to cast thanks to Jensen's mana fixing. 

Now, he was only a few wins away from locking up what would be his eleventh Grand Prix Top 8.

 Jensen started off the draft by taking a [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp), though he debated for a moment on taking [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary). "The white card was the best card in the pack," Jensen said after the draft, explaining the reason why the decision was not an easy one. Other notables in the very first pick included [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet), though it was not quite on the same power level as the two cards that Jensen was really looking at. The second pick brought Jensen a [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide), which he took over [Fanatic of Mogis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis) and [Tymaret, the Murder King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tymaret%2C+the+Murder+King). 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/events/gptor13/huey_draft.jpg) William Jensen  From there, Jensen took [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock), followed by two copies of [Mnemonic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mnemonic+Wall). A [Fleshmad Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshmad+Steed) followed, and then he took [Nylea's Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Presence). After that, picks started to dry up, and Jensen was juggling three colors: blue, black, and green. 

 Well, he was juggling green until shortly into the second pack. His first pick out of the second pack was the powerful [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), which he took over [Sea God's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+God%27s+Revenge), [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict), and [Dauntless Onslaught](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Onslaught). [Thassa's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Emissary) followed immediately after that, with Jensen spending all of five seconds on the decision once he fanned through the pack. [Keepsake Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keepsake+Gorgon) gave Jensen a powerful late-game creature, and the deadly uncommon was followed by back-to-back [Voyage's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End)s. 

 After that, however, cards started to dry up. Jensen added the fairly lackluster [Meletis Charlatan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meletis+Charlatan), [Bronze Sable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Sable), and Guardian of Meletis after, as he struggled to find any reasonable creatures or early plays. 

 Jensen started off the third pack by taking [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide), which ended up as his pick over [Curse of the Swine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+the+Swine) (which he thought about), as well as [Ordeal of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Thassa) and [Mogis's Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%27s+Marauder) (which were not considerations, since Jensen's deck was not going to capitalize on given the nature of his defensive deck). The second pick proved to be a debate over a wealth of riches, as Jensen took his second [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) over an excessive third [Voyage's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End) and a [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). [Read the Bones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones) followed that, as he shipped what was already a very late [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion). 

 Then, the pack started getting awkward. Jensen added a necessary [Felhide Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felhide+Minotaur) to his pile of cards, taking it over [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider), [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp), and the Karaga Warcaller. Another [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) came in the next match, as Jensen was forced to take one of the few playable options for his deck, [March of the Returned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Returned) (which could prove to be very annoying with his [Mnemonic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mnemonic+Wall)s post sideboarding against slower decks). However, Jensen was able to shore up his curve a little bit in the final few picks, adding [Returned Phalanx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Phalanx) and [Disciple of Phenax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax) to his pile. 

 After the draft, not much needed to be said. The key decision point of the draft was pick one, pack one, when Jensen took the [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) over [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary). "I don't like red or white that much," Jensen explained, one of his main reasons for sticking to the [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp), a safe bet, over [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary), a card he considers to rank a little bit higher over Asp. 

"I'm not too unhappy with how it turned out," Jensen said, referring to his draft. "I certainly don't have the best deck I could have had at my seat [referencing to the white creatures that he could have ended up with in the third pack], but the deck I ended up with certainly fits my style."

Jensen's choice to draft a deck that fit his style served him well, as it earned him two wins before he reached the fifteenth round, where he was able to safely draw into the Top 8 with the only other 13-1 competitors left in the event, Seth Manfield. 

You can check out what Jensen's final deck looked like below.

- ###  Sunday, 6:13 p.m. - Round 15 Round-Up

*by Mike Rosenberg*
  
The 1603 person Grand Prix Toronto has left many players at 12-2 records playing out their final matches, with almost nobody a lock for Top 8 with the exception of the two 13-1 record players: William Jensen and Seth Manfield. 

 This included both No. 17 Ranked Player Owen Turtenwald, who was seeking his third Grand Prix victory in a row, and No. 7 Ranked Player Samuel Black, who was playing for his incredible fifth major event Top 8 in a row (including his Top 8 at Pro Tour *Theros*). 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/events/gptor13/r15_tables.jpg) *The two big stories going into this weekend, Samuel Black and Owen Turtenwald, found themselves playing win-and-in matches in the final round of swiss at Grand Prix Toronto.* (7) Samuel Black vs. Greg Ogreenc 
The first match between Black and Greg Ogreenc, both Wisconsinites that have played against each other on the local often often over the years, featured a quick back-and-forth in game counts, mostly a result of Ogreenc's hyper aggressive Boros draft deck. 

 In the third game, both players were color stalled. Ogreenc was stuck on red mana, while Black had access to only black mana. When the coast appeared to be clear when Ogreenc cast [Dragon Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle) on his [Two-Headed Cerberus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Two-Headed+Cerberus), he went in on a big attack, giving his Cerberus [Titan's Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titan%27s+Strength) and pumping it once via the Mantle's effect. While Black found a Forest to let him [Time to Feed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+to+Feed) the three mana creature with his in-play [Returned Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Centaur) on the next turn, Ogreenc had another big turn with [Minotaur Skullcleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Skullcleaver). [Prowler's Helm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prowler%27s+Helm) enabled Ogreenc to send Black to 2 life after another [Titan's Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titan%27s+Strength) on the Skullcleaver. 

A turn later, and Black offered the handshake to a burn spell. 

Black 1 – Ogreenc 2 

Robert Smith vs. (17) Owen Turtenwald 
 Turtenwald's match, and his run for a third consecutive Grand Prix victory, was cut short against Galgary native and Grand Prix Seattle winner Robert Smith in two games. Smith's Boros deck, a common theme in these final rounds, featured not one, but two copies of [Anax and Cymede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anax+and+Cymede), which achieved some devastating results in both games. 

 In the first game, the legendary creature(s) allowed for his team to crash in for a big attack thanks to the aid of his Calvary Pegasus, dropping Turtenwald low enough that his sequence of [Voyage's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End)s and a [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock) for the Pegasus would not pull him out of the game with a win. 

 In the second game, Turtenwald's defenses rested on the shaky back of two [Fleshmad Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshmad+Steed)s, which were tapped when another of Turtenwald's creatures bit the dust to [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike). The resulting attack left Turtenwald at 1, and when nothing of merit came from the top of his deck over the next few turns, which degenerated to a standstill, Smith's creatures were eventually able to break through for the final point. 

Smith 2 – Turtenwald 0
