Hélène Bergeot started her career with Wizards of the Coast in France in December, 1995; afterwards, she spent a few years in the European headquarters based in Belgium and eventually relocated to the Renton office. She is currently the director of organized play and trade marketing. 






Due to an issue with the Grand Prix reporting software, the Grand Prix Barcelona scorekeeper identified that, after pairing Round 15, the match results from Round 14 were missing. As re-entering Round 15 before starting the Top 8 would have delayed the tournament by an estimated one hour minimum, after consulting with Wizards of the Coast, it was decided to start the Top 8 using players' total points plus the tiebreakers from Round 14.


However, after the scorekeepers entered the Round 15 results correctly, it was identified that the player who advanced to the Top 8 in 8th place should have instead finished in 9th place because of tiebreakers. The ultimate difference between tiebreakers of players in 8th and 9th place is 0.0026.


Jonas Friberg from Sweden should have been playing in the Top 8 of Grand Prix Barcelona.


With 39 match points accrued at GP Barcelona, Jonas already earned his qualification and flight to Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*. We, however, want to acknowledge that because of an issue with our system, Jonas did not have the chance to play in the Top 8, and have therefore decided to grant him an invitation and flight to Pro Tour Honolulu as well as a prize payout of $2,500 for his finish in Barcelona.
