The last undefeated player was as close to Top 8 as you get three rounds out from the end of Swiss. Daniel Fournier had been triumphant so far in *Born of the Gods* Limited, and we wanted to peek inside the process for the current "King of the Hill" and see how he's been handling the drafts today.

*Daniel Fournier was at the top of the tide of wins, remaining undefeated through both Day 1 and the first draft of Day 2 at Grand Prix Montreal.* 
 


**What did you draft at the start of the day?**


 


"I drafted red-white, not particularly heroic," Fournier said. "Basically I noticed red and white were very open. I like the archetype and it was basically handed to me: I got like an eleventh pick [Thunderous Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderous+Might). I think that cards like top two or top three cards in the set."


**How did that go?**


"In packs two and three I opened [Anax and Cymede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anax+and+Cymede) and was passed a fourth pick [Spear of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spear+of+Heliod). It looked like I was the only person at the table in those colors. I worked out well."


**Did you have a plan for the second draft?**


"I had talked with Alexander Hayne before sitting down for the second and he reminded me I 'just' have to 1-2 the draft," Fournier said. "I've never really attempted to do that before – I've never been in the winning position. So I did what I was used to and kept in mind I wanted a consistent deck: one or two colors, not being greedy. Otherwise, I don't like forcing archetypes in a draft."


**And how did that go?**


"Average; a little awkward.," Fournier admitted. "Red seemed open to me in pack one, but red is bad in *Theros* and very good in *Born of the Gods*. I'm fairly certain I passed the guy to the left of me into red, and it seemed like I was getting cut very hard. Fortunately I was able to pick up some good blue cards in pack two."


**You had a second pick [Mogis, God of Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%2C+God+of+Slaughter). Were you tempted at all to go for black-red?**

"I thought about it," Fournier said. "I play black-red in practice, and I lose with it. The card forces you into the black-red strategy that's unfortunately mediocre. Unlike [Xenagos, God of Revels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+God+of+Revels) and some of the other Gods the static ability isn't as good. Sometimes it's just '2 you.' and it's just mediocre."


 


**Were you surprised how quickly white and red dried up in the second pack?**


"Not really. The plan was by the end of pack one was to figure out what color was open and being passed to me in pack two. I thought it was white because I was passed [Phalanx Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader) – I wanted white. But that wasn't the case."


**What led you to commit to blue?**


"Good blue cards were going late. A lot of these packs had [Voyage's End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End), [Griptide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide), and a playable blue creature. With that density I felt it was the best color. Plus you can play a bunch of reasonable blue and red cards and win. [Voyage's End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End) is insane."

**Late in pack three you had a choice between [Ordeal of Purphoros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Purphoros) and [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike). Why did you go with Ordeal?** 


 


 


"That was the difficult one," Fournier said. When he saw the pack is had to put it down and think, unlike the rest of his picks throughout the draft. "Generally, I would want the Lighting Strike at that point. I was kind of low on burn spells and burn's good. I think I had two [Triton Fortune Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter)s and I needed more ways to trigger them. [Ordeal of Purphoros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Purphoros) is obviously one of the best ways to do that."


**How do you feel about your deck this time?**


"Much less happy than the first one. I couldn't have asked of better first draft. This is like a 6, or maybe a 7. I'm not confident, but I guess it's fine."


Daniel Fournier went on win Round 13 and secure a Top 8 berth for Grand Prix Montreal.
