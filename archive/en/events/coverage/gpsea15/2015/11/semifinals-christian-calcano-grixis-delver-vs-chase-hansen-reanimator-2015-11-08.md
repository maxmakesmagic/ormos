For Gold-level pro and *Magic* globetrotter Christian Calcano, a win here ensures that trophy number three is still within reach. His Grixis Delver deck, with a teensy splash for the green ability on [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman), has been serving him well all weekend long.


For Seattle local Chase Hansen, this Top 8 was already unexpected, but his longtime deck of choice in Legacy—Reanimator—got the student through into the Top 8. Now, he was just two wins away from being a hometown hero.


Who would take it down?


The Games
=========


Hansen led with [Hapless Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapless+Researcher), giving him the option of a brutal early start that Calcano was immediately able to see with 2 life and a [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe). Hansen's hand was revealed to contain two reanimation spells: [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate), [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead), and three lands. Calcano, with a [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman), and [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) in hand, opted to go slow and safe, passing with a [Flooded Strand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand) available.


Hansen's top-decked [Hapless Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapless+Researcher) gave him another option as he swung in for 1, passing with two potential discard outlets. However, as Calcano sculpted his mana base with fetch lands, Hansen had little to no action as a [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) was cast, resolved, and sat in play ready to exile any big creatures with an untapped [Tropical Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tropical+Island).

*Christian Calcano*


Another [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) further complicated matters. With two Deathrites now, Calcano felt safe to deploy his threats: two [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) and a [Gurmag Angler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Angler). A revealed [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) on top made the Delvers into [Insectile Aberration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration)s, and said [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) stopped a [Hapless Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapless+Researcher)'s discard effect when Calcano sent in his team.


When Hansen sacrificed the other one, Calcano let it go. [Misdirection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misdirection) from Hansen hit the bin after drawing his card, and Entomb dropped [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) in there as well. Suddenly, Hansen's graveyard started getting stocked, as on his turn, [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) put [Iona, Shield of Emeria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iona%2C+Shield+of+Emeria) in the graveyard. [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) earned a [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) once it came in, and when Hansen's [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) showed nothing to stop that, Hansen let out a quiet, "We're dead..." as he picked up his cards for Game 2.


During sideboarding, Calcano brought in some necessary interaction with Hansen's reanimation spells in place of his [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s and [Gurmag Angler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Angler)s. This included his copies of [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and some [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction)s. Upon one further glance through, Calcano added a little pressure as well as disruption in [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) from his board, siding out a [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle).


Hansen led off the second game with [Hapless Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapless+Researcher), while Calcano had [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman). The two players traded some back-and-forth action, with Hansen's [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) stopping Calcano's Shaman. Calcano replaced it with another, stopping the Shaman from dying to [Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm) with [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze), while [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s kept Hansen's land count contained. Once Deathrite was online with a [Tropical Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tropical+Island), Calcano moved towards [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), which transformed with a [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) reveal on the next turn.

*Chase Hansen*


With a hand of action and an active [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman), Calcano did not flinch at Hansen's [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) for [Iona, Shield of Emeria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iona%2C+Shield+of+Emeria). [Hapless Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapless+Researcher) put a [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) in the graveyard, and [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) presented a very interesting threat. Calcano responded with 2 life and a [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction), exiling [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) out of the game. Next, [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) exiled [Iona, Shield of Emeria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iona%2C+Shield+of+Emeria) before [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) finally resolved, netting Calcano another [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) and Hansen a [Hapless Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapless+Researcher).


From there, the game was all but over. [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) robbed Hansen of both [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)s in his hand as the [Insectile Aberration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) and [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) duo went to work.


Two turns later, and Hansen offered the handshake.


**Christian Calcano defeats Chase Hansen 2-0 and advances to the finals!**
