Decks of the Week is taking a break from our regularly scheduled inclusion of **Magic Online** deck lists to bring you a Pro Tour smorgasbord! The first lists from the Pro Tour–San Diego Qualifier season are in, and we bring you a giant double serving of *Zendikar* Draft decks. What strategies are the world's best using to succeed in the format?

On top of that, this past weekend marked the conclusion of Pro Tour-Austin. None other than the Dragonmaster himself, Brian Kibler, took the crown earning himself a championship after an illustrious career that has spanned decades. You can read all the [official coverage from the event on the coverage site](/en/events/coverage/kibler-completes-comeback-austin-victory). Of course, we've got a host of deck lists from the event below that you can enjoy right now (and the entirety of the Austin Extended deck lists will be right here next week!). We'll be back to our regularly scheduled program next week, so in the meanwhile enjoy!
