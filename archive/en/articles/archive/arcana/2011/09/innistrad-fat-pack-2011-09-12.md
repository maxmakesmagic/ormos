You look like someone who would like to see the *Innistrad* Fat Pack. Right? Sure!

Nice, eh? Oh—you wanted to see *inside*? Well, that can probably be managed. Before we take a look, though, here's what each *Innistrad* Fat Pack comes equipped with:

* Nine (yes, *nine*) 15-card booster packs
* A pack of 70 (yes, *seventy*) *Innistrad* basic land
* Ten of these *Innistrad* checklist cards for use with [double-faced cards](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/innistrad/dfcrules):

* A handsome sleeve that can be unfolded to reveal a montage of *Innistrad* art
* A card box with panoramic art of Liliana
* Two deck boxes
* The *Innistrad* Player's Guide, which contains play tips, story background, and a visual encyclopedia of every card in the set
* A learn-to-play insert
* An exclusive *Innistrad* Spindown Life Counter

And it looks like this!
