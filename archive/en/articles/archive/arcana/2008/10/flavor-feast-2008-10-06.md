When the *Starter 1999* set was created, it was purposely given a different setting from regular **Magic**. We'll tell you about that setting some time, because it's kind of interesting and we have a lot of interesting documents sitting around. For now, though, the important part is that while many **Magic** cards were used, they were given slightly different spins because they were now set on "a remote continent of Dominaria".

Even the flavor text underwent this process. Here's the original [Soul Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Feast) from *Urza's Destiny*:

![Soul Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soul+Feast)  

> *As no one has ever accepted a second invitation to Davvol's table, the evincar often dines alone.*

That's good, but it's too world-specific for *Starter 1999*. So it was boiled down to its essence:

![Soul Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soul+Feast)  

> *Evil often dines alone.*

When Soul Feast moved into the core set with *Seventh Edition*, it got another spin, moving away from the lonely-archvillain theme:

![Soul Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soul+Feast)  

> *You are who you eat.*

This art and flavor text stayed until [Soul Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Feast)'s most recent incarnation in *Tenth Edition*, when the vampire art got a more specific description:

![Soul Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soul+Feast)  

> *"I smell the tang of a mortal's fresh blood. I hear it sliding wetly beneath its skin. My hunger cannot refuse the invitation." â€”Yuri, Sengir vampire*

Finally, the flavor has come full circle, with a named character appearing in the flavor text. Neat!
