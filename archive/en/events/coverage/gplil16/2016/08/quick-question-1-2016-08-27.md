We asked a few of the more notable players in attendance at Grand Prix Lille for the most interesting, the most unusual, or, simply put, the most "techy" card in their deck or sideboard. Here's what they came up with …

**No. 21 Petr Sochůrek:** You'll have to decide which is more unusual. I have two [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker)s in my main deck and I have four [Rakdos Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Charm)s in my sideboard. I didn't have enough space to hate Affinity and [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge), and [Rakdos Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Charm) seemed like a good compromise.

**2014 World Magic Cup champion Simon Nielsen:** I run a stock version of [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Zoo, but I do have one [Faith's Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Shield) in the sideboard. The card's so sweet. It was great against Elves and Burn and Jund … I might run a second next time!

**Gold-Level pro Grzegorz Kowalski:** I really like [Rally the Peasants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Peasants). It's the way for [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge) to win against combo decks. It often speeds up your clock by one turn.

**Gold-level pro Thomas Hendriks:** Nothing really. I play a pretty standard list [of [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Aggro]. The most interesting thing about it is probably that I don't have any hate cards against [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge). Sidebaords can only contain that many cards and the matchup is quite winnable as is.

**Three-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor Jasper Grimmer:** [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker) in Abzan. It really is a better 4-drop than [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)!
