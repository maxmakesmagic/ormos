Ishida the Man of Steel at Japan Nationals 2011
===============================================




July 17-18, 2011












2011 Japan National Championship
--------------------------------


[Japanese coverage](http://coverage.mtg-jp.com/jpnats11/)
What a game, what a match, and what a weekend. Ryuuichirou Ishida claimed the title after a pulsating final against Tomoya Fujimoto that went the full five games and featured great **Magic** and great emotion.


Joining them on the National team is former World Champion Makihito Mihara, with Yoshihiko Ikawa also making the trip to Worlds in San Francisco as the alternate team member.


Fourteen rounds across two formats brought us to this final day. There was variety all over the Standard environment. The top 8 alone saw five different archetypes, with Valakut, [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) , Blue-Black Control, Tezzeret, and Green-White all reaching the elimination rounds. The Green-White deck of Fujimoto is well worth an outing at your next **Friday Night Magic**, as it's a ton of fun to play, and has plenty of options. It very, very nearly took Fujimoto the distance, but it was Ishida who was the man of steel - [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) .

This was the largest Nationals event held anywhere in the world, with three hundred and fifty eight competitors taking part. There was plenty to do apart from the main event, including the inaugural Battle of Champions, won by Masaya Kitayama, who bested Katsuhiro Mori in their Super Sealed final earlier in the day.


One of the leading stories was the success of Shouta Yasooka, taking his shot at Nationals Pro Points ahead of his main Player of the Year rivals in other countries. Messrs Juza, Turtenwald, Stark, and others must have been mighty relieved when Yasooka set the bar at 'only'


making the top 8. That quarterfinal defeat may yet play a huge part in the destination of the Player of the Year title. Perhaps U.S.


Nationals at Gen Con in a couple of weeks will give us more insight into that particular race.


Now, though, it's time to reflect on a fantastic weekend in one of the great **Magic** nations. Only one of the three team members is a global name on the **Magic** scene, but everyone begins with their first Pro Tour, and both finalists have the right stuff to succeed when Worlds comes around in November. Congratulations to Yoshihiko Ikawa, Makihito Mihara, Tomoya Fujimoto, and most of all to Ryuuichirou Ishida, Japan National Champion 2011!

Quarterfinals: Quarterfinal Round-Up
------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon* 

We're going to keep an eye on all the quarterfinal action as it happens, but we begin with Shouta Yasooka's quest for Player of the Year, a title he last won in 2006. He brings his Tezzeret deck into action against Tomoya Fujimoto, who is really living the dream this weekend, since he won the Last Chance Qualifier on Friday. He brings an interesting green-white deck, but it may not be seen to best advantage here against the might of Yasooka.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/qf_yasooka_fujimoto.JPG)*Shouta Yasooka, left, vs. Tomoya Fujimoto.*
Yasooka opened the top 8 with a turn two [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) , by which time [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) had been the perfect opening for Fujimoto. His turn two was a second [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) . [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) allowed Yasooka to strip [Blade Splicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+Splicer) from Fujimoto's hand, before Yasooka added [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) , gearing up to kill [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) the following turn.


Fujimoto cast [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) , then passed. As expected, Yasooka ticked up the [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) , blew it to kill both [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) , then cast [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas) before turning his [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) into a 5/5. Fujimoto piled into the red zone, sending [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) , [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) , and the two bonus Soldiers that came with the Hero.


Tezzeret fell to dead, as did the [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) , and Yasooka fell to thirteen. He laid a second [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) , taking him to five mana, and passed the turn with his 5/5 [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) his only board presence.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/qf_yasooka.JPG)*Shouta Yasooka*
Fujimoto had [Journey to Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) for the Orb, and crashed in with two Soldiers and [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) , with Yasooka now at nine. He tapped out for [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) , which was enough to have Fujimoto simply lay a land and pass. [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) attacked unmolested, taking Yasooka back to thirteen. He used one of his [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) s to kill [Stirring Wildwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood) , and went back to beating with [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) when Fujimoto had no play.


Yasooka used his four mana to cast [Everflowing Chalice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) for two, which left Fujimoto a window to cast [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) , destroying the [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) .


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/qf_fujimoto.JPG)*Tomoya Fujimoto*
Yasooka used his [Everflowing Chalice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) to cast [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) , two words that are never a good sign for an opponent. [Black Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) for two wiped the board except for the giant flying card advantage machine, and Yasooka completed a great turn with [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) , sending the planeswalker to five loyalty. [Journey to Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) replied from Fujimoto, taking out the [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) , but the card advantage had found Yasooka his new *M12* kill card, [Sorin's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%27s+Vengeance) .


**Yasooka 1 - 0 Fujimoto**


In the Valakut mirror match, it looked as if Makihito Mihara was taking control of game one. He had [Avenger of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar) on the battlefield with seven plants for support, together with [Oracle of Mul Daya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) , which may be quite good together...On the other side of the table Kouei Itou had just a pair of [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) .


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/qf_ito_mihara.JPG)*Kouei Itou vs. Makihito Mihara*
Meanwhile, Yoshihiko Ikawa led Ryoichi Tamada by a lightning-fast 2-0, his [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) deck piling past the Valakut player, despite an eleven card sideboard package to swing the matchup back towards Tamada. In game three, however, Ikawa mulliganed to five, which was hardly promising.


Tamada opened with Valakut, but despite a double mulligan Ikawa had plenty of thinking to do about his turn one. He laid [Glacial Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Fortress) tapped and cast [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) for free. [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) from Tamada led to [Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) and a second [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) . [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) from Ikawa revealed [Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast) and [Origin Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin+Spellbomb) , which he unsurprisingly sent away, picking up [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) from the top. [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) attacked for the first damage, Ikawa laid a second land, and was done. Most definitely not the explosive starts of the first two games, but that's what happens when you mulligan to five.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/qf_tamada.JPG)*Ryoichi Tamada*
Tamada laid [Khalni Heart Expedition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Heart+Expedition) and a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to begin his quest to up the [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) s count, while Ikawa tapped out for [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) before attacking for three with his lonely [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) . Tamada had [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) for a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) . In came the [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) again, with Ikawa laying [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) , still holding two cards in hand. Tamada, though, had four. The first was [Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) , the next [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) , the next a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) , and the next [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) , taking out [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) .


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/qf_ikawa_tamada.JPG)*Yoshihiko Ikawa vs. Ryoichi Tamada*
Ikawa attacked for two, with Tamada down to eleven. [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) cleared the board, and Tamada felt confident enough to activate his [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) and pile in. That was the cue for Ikawa to sweep up his permanents, completing a comprehensive misfire that made the score..


**Tamada 1 - 2 Ikawa**


 


### Score updates from the other quarterfinals


Fujimoto had managed to equalize againt Yasooka, making them now a best two out of three. Ryuuichirou Ishida had taken his [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) deck to a 2-0 lead over the Blue-Black Control of Shouta Takao, while Makihito Mihara had indeed taken the opening game of the Valakut mirror, and led 1-0.


Ikawa opened with [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) in game four, paying two life via Phyrexian mana. It attacked on turn two, followed up by [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) . Tamada added to his [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) with a second copy, and passed. [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) activated the [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) before Ikawa cast [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) , crashing in for seven damage. [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) took out the [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) , which was precisely what Tamada needed to stay in contention. Ikawa cast [Origin Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin+Spellbomb) with his [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) , activated his [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) , and attacked. The card he drew with [Origin Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin+Spellbomb) still didn't net him a third land, and the pair of [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) he was holding were stuck there, worthless in his hand.


Still, Tamada was down to seven, and needed something more heavy-duty than [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) . Something like [Creeping Corrosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Corrosion) , for example, which he promptly cast. Ikawa attempted to reload with two [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) s, but the sideboard of Tamada arrived again when he cast [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) to wipe the board again. When Tamada tapped six mana for [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) , Ikawa conceded, and we were heading for a very brisk game five shootout.


**Ikawa 2 - 2 Tamada**


Fujimoto now led Shouta Yasooka by 2-1, and was looking to cause an upset. It looked as if the [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) deck of Ryuuichirou Ishida was going to sweep the blue-black Control of Shouta Takao, while the Valakut mirror was still in the early stages of game two, so there's a good chance you'll be reading about that one in about three paragraphs from now....


Ikawa kept his opening seven, and so did Tamada, a bad sign for Ikawa, who opened with [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) . [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) on turn two saw [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) on top, which Ikawa sent away, getting a land instead.


[Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) attacked for one, with [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) the turn two land from Ikawa. Tamada sacrificed [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) for a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) , and spent turn two on [Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) , a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) , and [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) .


Ikawa landed [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) and attacked for three with his [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) .


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/qf_ikawa.JPG)Tamada used his three mana to [Cultivate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) , adding a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to the board, and a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) to hand, which he cast as his land for the turn, leaving [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) mana open. The [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) attacked for another three, and Ikawa dropped [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) , apparently for the first time in the whole match, since Tamada wanted to check what the card did, Ikawa playing with an English version of the card...


Tamada reached six mana, and then moments later eight, which meant [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) . That had been the cue for the concession in game four, but not this time. Tamada was at thirteen and Ikawa had a possibly awesome turn coming. He opened with [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) , seeing [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) , leaving them on top, and drawing the [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) . He cast it, and used [Dispatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispatch) to kill the [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) , now that he had Metalcraft. In came the [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) , the [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) , and two Soldiers, and now Tamada was at just two life.


The Valakut player untapped with eight mana, but basically needed [Creeping Corrosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Corrosion) AND [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) on this one turn if he was going to survive. Or, a LOT of red-hot Valakut action.Ikawa sat motionless as he waited to discover his fate. Tamada cast [Khalni Heart Expedition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Heart+Expedition) .


He cast [Cultivate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) , but Ikawa had a card waiting - [Unified Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unified+Will) !


Now THAT's why you play blue boys and girls...


During the final game here, two of the other quarterfinals reached their conclusion. As expected, Ishida took the third game and the sweep over blue-black, while Tomoya Fujimoto completed an excellent victory over Shouta Yasooka.


**Ikawa 3 - 2 Tamada**


**Ishida 3 - 0 Takao**


And you know what? That Valakut mirror was done too, and that could mean only one thing - a clean sweep for Makihito Mihara!


So, in a little less than an hour all four quarterfinals were done.


Ikawa had managed to squeeze past Tamada in a really tight five game set. He would now take his [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) deck into action against the green-white deck of Tomoya Fujimoto, who had taken out Shouta Yasooka by 3-1. In the bottom bracket, Ryuuichirou Ishida, on the back of his 3-0 quarterfinal win over Shouta Takao, would face the Valakut deck of Makihito Mihara, himself a 3-0 quarterfinal winner.


Steel against green-white.


Steel against Valakut.


Who would prove their metal mettle in the semifinals?


 

Semifinals – Semifinal Round-Up
-------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon* 

Both players arrive here in the semifinals knowing that they will both be on the plane for Worlds in San Francisco. The winner here advances to the title match, while the loser faces the toughest match of the **Magic** year, coming off a loss before facing the 3rd/4th playoff which will determine the final member of the National team for Worlds.


Neither player dropped a game in the opening elimination round, so come here ready to battle with confidence.


Ishida began with a double mulligan, so his chance for an explosive start was small, especially as he was on the draw. [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) began the match, before Ishida had [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) into [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) into [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) . Oh, ok then, explosive start after all. Mihara cast [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) on turn two, his own version of the explosive start, and we were under way.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/d3_SF_ikawa.jpg)*Yoshihiko Ikawa*
Ishida attacked for three, cast [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) , but couldn't improve his position further, having no second land. That wasn't a problem for Mihara, who cast [Cultivate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) to take him to five mana on turn three, one of which was [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) . He was already up to three [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) s. No second land was waiting for Ishida who attacked for four, before seeing Mihara land [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) , fetching a second Valakut and a fourth [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) . Best guess? 1-0 to Mihara...


Ishida took one more look for a second land, didn't find it, but continued to push in, dropping Mihara to ten. He cast [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) , returned his [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) , and recast it. [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) attacked, Mihara found two [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) s, and best guess became fact moments later.


**Mihara 1 - 0 Ishida**


On the second table things were going rather better for the [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) player, with Yoshihiko Ikawa up a game over his green-white opponent Tomoya Fujimoto.


**Ikawa 1 - 0 Fujimoto**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/d3_SF_isida.jpg)*Ryuuichirou Ishida*
Ishida was happy to keep his opening seven, beginning with [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) and [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) on turn one. Turn two saw him attack for two, cast [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) , and pass, leaving Mihara to fetch a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) from his opening [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) . [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) was all he could expect from turn two, but that opened the way for plenty of beats on turn three.


[Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) meant Mihara took ten damage from the [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) , [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) , and [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) , with [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) activating the Idol before attacking. Mihara was - as they say - dead on the desk, and he had no answer to the blistering opening from Ishida.


**Mihara 1 - 1 Ishida**


If you thought it was blistering here, you should have seen the other table! TWO games had been completed while these two were 'slogging' their way through game two, meaning it was time to check in on the other semifinal before it was done!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/d3_SF_fujimoto.jpg)*Tomoya Fujimoto*
**Ikawa 1 - 2 Fujimoto**


Ikawa had two [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and an [Origin Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin+Spellbomb) token early in game four, while Fujimoto also had early action with [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) , [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) , and [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) . Ikawa landed [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) and swung for the fences. He had three cards in hand to Fujimoto's four, with Fujimoto happy to lose his [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) token to soak up some damage.


He cast a second [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and then [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) for the [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) . [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) and [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) attacked, leaving Ikawa at sixteen. He had another [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) at the ready, with [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) taking out a [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) .


For six mana Fujimoto cast [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) , and we had reached the pivotal moment. If Ikawa could deal with it, he still had the chance to force Fujimoto to block unprofitably. If the Wurmcoil got to attack, Fujimoto would be heading out of sight. [Revoke Existence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revoke+Existence) from Ikawa answered that question, and he attacked once more. [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) and [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) blocked the [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) , trading two-for-one, and Fujimoto was down to just two life. Down came [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) for Ikawa.


Fujimoto drew for the turn, and cast [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) , emptying his hand with [Stirring Wildwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood) . Ikawa attacked with the [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) , forcing Fujimoto to block with [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) . Now Fujimoto needed a flyer, and he didn't get one...


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/d3_SF_ikawaVSfujimoto.jpg)*Yoshihiko Ikawa (left) and Tomoya Fujimoto (right)*
**Ikawa 2 - 2 Fujimoto**


Across the hall, [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) now led the match 2-1, Ishida having come from behind to lead Mihara's Valakut deck.


Now we got ready for game five, still only half an hour into these semifinals! Fujimoto kept his opening seven, while Ikawa thought for a moment before setting the game in motion. [Stirring Wildwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood) for Fujimoto met [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) from Ikawa. Fujimoto had [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) on turn two, sending Ikawa deep into thought. For the second match running he was in an intricate game five.


In came the [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) . [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) was Ikawa's play. Fujimoto's play was more exciting, using [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) to help cast [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) , and then attacking with the Cobra, dropping Ikawa to seventeen. It looked as if Fujimoto was winning this particular episode of 'Who's the Beatdown?'


[Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) from Ikawa triggered the [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) , before he spilled [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) onto the table. Fujimoto had the perfect answer in [Creeping Corrosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Corrosion) ! It wasn't just the perfect answer for the turn, it was the perfect answer for the match, as Ikawa was quick to extend the hand in congratulation.


**Yoshihiko Ikawa 2 - 3 Tomoya Fujimoto**


Meanwhile in game four of the other semifinal, Ryuuichirou Ishida had [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) , [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) , [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) , and [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer) , all with two counters on them, facing [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) , [Overgrown Battlement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) , and [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) for Mihara. Two counters became three, and Ishida had a total of three copies of [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) . Mihara, however, had a second copy of [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) arriving, and that was enough to force a deciding game five, which would see Ishida on the play with his [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) deck.


**Mihara 2 - 2 Ishida**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/d3_SF_isida_2.jpg)*Ryuuichirou Ishida*
The first battle of the last battle was won by Ishida when he kept his opening seven and Mihara mulliganed. He kept six, and we were away, with turn one [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) and a [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) for Ishida. Mihara laid [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) . Turn two, and Ishida attacked, and dropped [Shrine of Loyal Legions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Loyal+Legions) and a [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) . He also had [Contested War Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) in play, which might well be a factor. [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) became a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) , and a turn two [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) led to his customary acceleration via [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) . How he must have wished for a [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) instead...


The first counter went on Ishida's [Shrine of Loyal Legions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Loyal+Legions) . He sent his [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) and [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) on the attack, dealing two damage.


[Porcelain Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire) joined the team, putting a second counter on the Shrine. Land four for Mihara, and that was enough for both [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) and [Overgrown Battlement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) . The pressure was intense, and Mihara was clearly feeling it.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/d3_SF_mihara.jpg)*Makihito Mihara*
Ishida added a third counter to his Shrine, and Mihara elected not to block when Ishida sent in the team. Knowing that Mihara had to deal with what was on board, Ishida kept his three cards in hand back for a potential second wave - or third, given that the legions were on the way. Mihara, though, had kept his [Overgrown Battlement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) safe for a reason. He cast a second [Overgrown Battlement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) , tapped the first for two mana, taking him to five and casting [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) for [Oracle of Mul Daya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) . The top card of his deck was [Cultivate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) , but Mihara had a [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) ready to spin the wheel on the top of his deck.


Now the top was revealed as a [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) , causing a sharp intake of breath from the large crowd.


Ishida started doing the math, and made three tokens with his Shrine at end of turn. He untapped with a mighty army ready to rumble, and sent them in, activating the [Contested War Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) . Mihara fell to just one life. He drew, but had no answer, and an ecstatic Ryuuichirou Ishida raised his hands aloft in triumph. He was through to a championship matchup against Tomoya Fujimoto, while Mihara would take on Yoshihiko Ikawa for the final slot on the National team.


**Makihito Mihara 2 - 3 Ryuuichirou Ishida**


 

Battle of Champions – Masaya Kitayama vs. Katsuhiro Mori
--------------------------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon* 

After four rounds of Super Sealed action, eleven former champions have been whittled down to two. First, the 2007 Champion Masaya Kitayama. Twice a finalist at Grand Prix, and with four Pro Tour top 32s to his name, he is clearly no slouch. Nonetheless, he comes into the final here as the underdog, since he faces Katsuhiro Mori.


Mori has multiple Grand Prix titles, a World Champion trophy from 2005, and three successive Worlds top 8 performances. He's also - for another couple of hours - the reigning National Champion.


Both players were given a fresh set of twelve *M12* boosters to build new Super Sealed pools, so neither had any idea what would be waiting for them across the table. Having seen both players build their decks, it looked as though Mori was going to take a lot of stopping. He had built an aggressive red-black Bloodthirst deck, topping out at [Sengir Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire) , [Vengeful Pharaoh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Pharaoh) , and a near-guaranteed win in [Sorin's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%27s+Vengeance) . Kitayama had gone white-red, with both [Chandra, the Firebrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+the+Firebrand) and [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) . He also had [Sun Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan) at the top end of his curve.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/battleOfChampions.jpg)*Katsuhiro Mori vs. Masaya Kitayama*
Kitayama began with a turn two [Stormfront Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus) , which was in play for approximately one second, [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) sending it to the graveyard. He had [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) on turn three for the first damage of the match.


Mori had [Blood Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre) , but with no Bloodthirst. The Phoenix attacked for a second time before Kitayama added [Gideon's Lawkeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Lawkeeper) to the board.


Mori attacked with his [Blood Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre) , and had Bloodthirst with his [Stormblood Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormblood+Berserker) . He [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) ed the Lawkeeper, with Kitayama also using [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) to get the [Blood Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre) off the board.


Both players had powerhouse moves at five mana. Mori had [Sengir Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire) , Kitayama [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) . [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) destroyed the Angel, and Mori added pressure with a second [Stormblood Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormblood+Berserker) , again a 3/3 thanks to Bloodthirst. With yet another burn spell in [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) , Mori was quickly one game up.


**Kitayama 0 - 1 Mori**


### Game 2


[Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Grim%2BLavamancer)
[Alabaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Mage) faced [Goblin Fireslinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Fireslinger) in the early turns of game two. [Benalish Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Veteran) was the turn three play from Kitayama, but Mori had a 3/3 all the time with [Stormblood Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormblood+Berserker) . Kitayama cast [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) on the 3/3, and attacked. Mori blocked with his [Goblin Fireslinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Goblin%2BFireslinger), trading for the [Alabaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Mage) , and Mori had [Chandra's Outrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage) for the [Benalish Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Veteran) . A replacement Veteran followed from Kitayama.


Down came [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) for Mori, prompting [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) from Kitayama before attacking. He had [Blood Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre) as a 3/3 to complete the turn.


[Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) from Mori got back the [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) with a spare mana to get the 1/1 back onto the battlefield. Kitayama sent in his pair of 3/3s, with Mori taking all the damage. [Celestial Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge) then took out the [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) for the second time.


Mori cast [Tormented Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Soul) , another excellent Bloodthirst enabler, and [Onyx Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Onyx+Mage) , but he was on the back foot against the [Benalish Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Veteran) and [Blood Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre) , both masquerading as [Hill Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant) s. When Mori traded for the Veteran, Kitayama was ready with the massive [Sun Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan) , getting it straight back. That was enough for Mori, who was happy to prepare for game three.


**Kitayama 1 - 1 Mori**


### Game 3



![Grand Abolisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grand+Abolisher)

One of the features of Super Sealed is that it's possible to build multiple good decks, and there becomes an element of Metagame to the matches, as players try to work out which of their decks will match up best against whatever their opponent is running. At one each, it seemed Mori was preparing for a major switch.


[Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) led the way for Mori, while Kitayama had the same turn two [Stormfront Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus) to get the ball rolling. Mori used [Plummet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet) to kill the flyer, but Kitayama had another [Stormfront Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus) as backup.


[Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) killed it, but Kitayama was making the running, with [Alabaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Mage) and then [Grand Abolisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Abolisher) . Mori used [Arachnus Web](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web) to ignore the [Grand Abolisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Grand%2BAbolisher). Next from Kitayama was [Arbalest Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbalest+Elite) , and this was taken out by [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) . Kitayama returned the favor when Mori attempted [Garruk's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion) , seeing it [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) ed. He too had a second copy, and this time the 3/2 survived at least as far as Kitayama untapping and firing off a second [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) .



![Sun Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sun+Titan)

Mori got to six mana, and cast [Inferno Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) which wiped the board, but that was all, as [Celestial Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge) instantly sent it away. Mori cast [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) , but another Titan was on the way, this time [Sun Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan) for Kitayama, getting back [Stormfront Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus) . Mori attacked with the Spider, enabling his [Stormblood Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormblood+Berserker) to become 3/3. Kitayama didn't care. He dropped Mori to six, using [Alabaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Mage) to gain a stack of life from his [Sun Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan) .


After much thought - and [Sun Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan) will do that to you - Mori passed the turn. Things got much worse for him when Kitayama cast another powerful rare in [Flameblast Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon) . That's [Flameblast Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon) , [Sun Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan) , two [Stormfront Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus) , [Alabaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Mage) ....against a lone [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) .


That's not a fair fight, and a moment later the fight was over. By two games to one, **Masaya Kitayama was the victor in the Battle of Champions!**


 

The Final - Tomoya Fujimoto (Green-White) vs. Ryuuichirou Ishida (Tempered Steel)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon* 

First they won their quarterfinals. That guaranteed them a plane ticket to Worlds. Then they won their semifinals. That guaranteed them a place on the National team. Now it's time for the final, and one of these two will be forever-remembered as a National Champion, while one of them, er, won't.


Fujimoto has already used his green-white deck to edge past another [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) opponent, defeating Yoshihiko Ikawa in the semifinals by 3-2. Ishida meanwhile had to pass Makihito Mihara in the semifinal, taking out the Valakut player in another five game set.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/DSC_0059.JPG)*Ryuuichirou Ishida vs. Tomoya Fujimoto* 
### Game 1


[Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) , [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) , [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) - and that was just turn one! Ishida got the ball rolling in good style. Fujimoto had turn one [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) . Ishida laid [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) , [Contested War Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) , and smashed in for six, using the War Zone to good effect. With Metalcraft also good to go, he used [Dispatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispatch) to deny Fujimoto the acceleration of the [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) . Fujimoto had to be content with [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) , with accompanying 0/1 Eldrazi token.


Ishida cast [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) , and in came the team. Already at fourteen, Fujimoto was in a tight spot. So tight, in fact, that he knew he was stuck. Turn three, good game, 1-0. Wow.


**Fujimoto 0 - 1 Ishida**


### Game 2


Ishida had shown real passion after his victory over Mihara, and it was obvious as he prepared for game two that he was acutely aware of the glittering prize on offer. [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) , [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) , [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) , [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) , [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) . Excuse me????? That was turn one from Ishida. Turn two from Fujimoto was [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) .


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/finalZeroCast.jpg)In came many, many men. Fujimoto was at fourteen, with Ishida adding [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) at the cost of two life. [Marsh Flats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flats) triggered [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) , and then again as Fujimoto went in search of a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) . That meant five mana on turn three, which he used to cast [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) , nailing the [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) and making Ishida's board position a lot less scary.


[Contested War Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) arrived, meaning Ishida could pile his men sideways once again, now that they could successfully trade with the [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) across the table. The Slime blocked [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) , with Fujimoto keeping his [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) back, at the cost of being down to seven life. The Cobra attacked, allowing him to steal the [Contested War Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) . It is Contested, after all. [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) completed the turn.


[Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) attacked Fujimoto to five, getting [Contested War Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) back for Ishida. He cast [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) , [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) , and passed. With [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) triggering, Fujimoto got to seven mana, enough for [Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elesh+Norn%2C+Grand+Cenobite) . Strangely enough, that'll do it...


Fujimoto 1 - 1 Ishida


### Game 3


Fujimoto had [Creeping Corrosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Corrosion) in his opening hand for game three, an utter beating against the all-artifact, all-the-time deck across the table. [Creeping Corrosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Corrosion) , however, costs four, and that's a long time to wait on the draw, especially if you know your opponent has a hand sufficient to keep, which Ishida had already done.


[Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) , [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) . That was it for turn one, while Fujimoto had [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) . Two mana was for [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer) , while Fujimoto had three mana available with the Birds. He didn't need the bonus, casting [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) (plus 0/1) with his two lands. [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) arrived, followed by [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) , triggering the Idol. Although it couldn't attack, it could get a counter from [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer) . In came the first [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) , and we were back to Fujimoto, who - as we know - had [Creeping Corrosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Corrosion) . Once the board was empty, [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) attacked, and Fujimoto was in control.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/Ishida.jpg)*Ryuuichirou Ishida's fast start in the finals disappeared by Game 3.*
[Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) from Ishida was a potential threat down the line, but no backbreaker, with nothing to pump. [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) came down for Fujimoto, which left Ishida to see if there was any way he could get back into this third game. [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) , a second [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) . No, that wouldn't do it. In came Fujimoto with [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) , two Soldiers, [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) , and even the [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) , getting in on the attacking act.


Nope. No help for Ishida.


**Fujimoto 2 - 1 Ishida**


### Game 4


Offering up a prayer, Ishida looked at his opening seven for game four. Head in hands, he pondered, then elected to mulligan. At least Fujimoto was also starting with six cards. Ishida couldn't keep his next hand either, but Fujimoto was happier, and would start up one card. If Ishida could pull off a similar opening to game two when he dropped almost his entire hand onto the battlefield on turn one, he might be able to find a route to victory on top of his library.


As he looked at five, this was a huge moment. He simply had to have something playable to stand a chance. Turn one was [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) , [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) , and [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) . Not bad. [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) attacked, [Contested War Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) came down, and [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) followed. Fujimoto had no [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) , and when he cast [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) he found that gone within moments via [Dispatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispatch) . [Porcelain Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire) activated [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) , and in came the beats from Ishida.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/Fujimoto.jpg)*Could Tomoya Fujimoto put it away in Game 4?*
[Journey to Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) from Fujimoto stopped the [Porcelain Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire) from getting involved, but [Contested War Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) still meant Fujimoto was down to ten life. He cast [Blade Splicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+Splicer) for the first time in the match, creating a 3/3 first striker to go with his 1/1. Not bad for three mana. The [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) could still take to the skies unopposed, but Ishida had to be wary of losing his [Contested War Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) .


He cast [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) , and sent the Idol into battle. The [Contested War Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) made it three damage, and Fujimoto was at seven, facing an opponent with just one card in hand.


The 3/3 Golem attacked, Ishida putting [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) in the way, keeping his 0/2 [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) back as a flying beater for the following turn.


Fujimoto passed, giving more hope to Ishida, who really wanted to see a [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) . He saw [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) instead, cast it, and sent his air force into action, pumping them with [Contested War Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) . Four more life gone, Fujimoto at just three life.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/Ishida%202.jpg)*A familiar sight from a Tempered Steel deck...men turning sideways in the red zone.*
He attacked with both [Blade Splicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+Splicer) and Golem, stealing the [Contested War Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) , but staying alive to benefit was the problem. [Stirring Wildwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood) came down, and Ishida had one more chance to force game five.


[Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) activated the [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) . Fujimoto was at one, and had to give back the [Contested War Zone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+War+Zone) . He badly needed a fifth land, but didn't see one. In came [Blade Splicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+Splicer) and Golem once again. The [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) s blocked, and Fujimoto passed.


[Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) triggered the [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) , and with [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) s and [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) in Fujimoto's hand, the absence of a fifth land had cost him the game. A mulligan to five had been overcome, and we were heading for a decider.


**Fujimoto 2 - 2 Ishida**


### Game 5


It had been an excellent final. Both players had contributed, played hard, played courteously, and the games had a good mix of power, intrigue, and excitement. Undoubtedly adding to the drama for the spectators was the heart-on-sleeve emotions of Ishida. While Fujimoto remained stoic throughout, every scrap of intellect, effort, and desire could be seen in Ishida. Now the question was whether he would overcook and destroy himself in the heat of battle, or use that desire to claim the title.


Both players kept their opening seven, making the ideal start to a final game. On the draw, Ishida had [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) , [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) , replayed [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) , and [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) . Pretty good to be sure. Fujimoto had turn two [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) . Did Ishida have a [Dispatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispatch) waiting? He activated [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) to gain Metalcraft, and sent the Cobra packing, before sending the [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) into battle. Fujimoto recovered with [Blade Splicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+Splicer) , with 3/3 Golem in tow.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/Fujimoto%202.jpg)*Things were looking grim for Fujimoto in Game 5.*
Down came [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) for Ishida, and another [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) . Fujimoto was at fifteen, and staring down the barrel, even with his first strike Golem. Ishida had just one card left to play, but it could be the card that claimed a National Championship. Fujimoto held double [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) , [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) , and two land. He sent in the Golem before casting the planeswalker, dropping him to two loyalty in exchange for a 3/3 Beast.


Ishida now had double [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) to play with, and he sent both of them at Fujimoto, and [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) at Garruk. [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) completed the turn. Could Fujimoto find a way to stay alive? He was at six poison, facing an arsenal of flying Nexuses. Nexi. Whatever. He sent in the [Blade Splicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+Splicer) and Golem, with [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) blocking. A second [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) came down, he untapped two land, and played [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) .


Back to Ishida, who was so close to the finish line he could almost touch it. He activated his Blinkmoths, and sent everything into the red zone. The Inkmoths aimed directly at Fujimoto, while the rest took out Garruk for the second successive turn. Fujimoto drew for the turn, and extended the hand.


Ishida let out a howl of delight as a huge burst of adrenaline, relief, and ecstasy flooded across his face.
