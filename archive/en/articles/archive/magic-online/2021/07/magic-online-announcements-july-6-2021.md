You'll get your first chance to attack the darkness with *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* when events begin Thursday morning at 10 a.m. PT. This includes the normal suite of Limited events you've grown to expect with *Magic Online*. *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* will also go on sale in the Store at the same time.
