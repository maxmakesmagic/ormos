MOCS Season 2 Updates
---------------------


Event info and schedules concerning upcoming MOCS Season 2 Premier Play events have been updated across the MTGO site.


The main changes for Season 2 are:


* The MOCS Leaderboard returns!
	+ Earn Leaderboard Points by finishing in the Top 8 of any Premier event featuring playoff rounds (Format Challenges, Qualifiers, Super Qualifiers, and all MOCS Showcase events).
	+ Top 2 on the Leaderboard after the last MOCS Open earn At-Large invites to the Champions Showcase.
* Changes to Showcase Challenges
	+ Based on player feedback, instead of three per day clumped into a single weekend, there is now one Showcase Challenge per day across two weekends in each group.
	+ Showcase Challenges and Showcase Qualifiers will be held in Legacy, Modern, Pioneer, and Vintage formats
* Super Qualifiers will allow players who have already qualified to participate.
	+ Invites to the Set Championship will pass down if won by an already-qualified player.

You can view these updates on the [MTGO Premier Play page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2021) and [MTGO event schedule](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/schedule-magic-online-products-game-info).

Spotlight Cube Series: *MenguCube*
----------------------------------


Our last addition to the Spotlight Cube Series for *Kaldheim* season, *MenguCube* is Andrea Mengucci's take on MTGO's regular *Vintage Cube*, but with more of the archetypes and colors that Andrea and his friends from Senigallia, Italy, enjoy most: blue cards and artifacts. *MenguCube* runs until tomorrow, April 14.


For a full list cards and an explanation of archetypes, check out [Andrea's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/spotlight-cube-series-mengucube%20-2021-04-06).

Showcase Qualifiers
-------------------


Players who earned entry into the Showcase Qualifier will be squaring off for an invitation to the Champions Showcase. The entry fee for Showcase Qualifiers is a format token that matches the format of the Showcase. As with QPs, after the season's Showcase Qualifiers are finished, all unused Format Tokens will be removed from players' accounts. Each Showcase Qualifier is a scheduled Swiss-style event with a Top 8 playoff. The winner of each Showcase Qualifier earns a spot in the final Showcase event and a chance to earn their share of $70,000 and an upcoming Premier Event invitation.


Showcase Qualifiers are scheduled as follows:





| **DATE** | **TIME** | **EVENT** | **FORMAT** | **INVITATION** |
