| 2001 Grand Prix Taipei Coverage |

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gp_lg.gif)Well, it's official: There's no stopping Team AlphaBetaUnlimited.com. They defeated Anchans in a gruelling match that saw each team member fight a best-of-five. After Dave Williams and Katsuhiro Mori took their respective matches, it was down to Chris Benafel against Panzer Hunters frontman, Itaru Ishida. Benafel's air force ruled the day, and ABU have another title for their resume. Congratulations to Team AlphaBetaUnlimited.com, Grand Prix - Taipei Champions!
