Here is the puzzle "Crossing the Threshold" from the *Torment* Fat Pack. You can read through the text version of the puzzle here, or you can download the PDF by clicking the picture below. At the end of this article is the answer… but give it a try on your own first! No cheating!

### Crossing the Threshold

Your opponent is Worth. You and he are playing a game using *Odyssey* and *Torment* cards. You were doing well until Worth enchanted your Childhood Horror with Kirtar's Desire. Last turn, Worth got you down to 4 life with [Stern Judge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stern+Judge), played [Wayward Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayward+Angel), and enchanted the Angel with [Druid's Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Druid%27s+Call). Things look bleak, but on your turn you draw a card and realize you can win. It is the start of your main phase. **Defeat Worth this turn without losing yourself.**

You are playing a black deck, have 4 life remaining, 2 cards in hand, and 3 cards in the graveyard.

### The Answer

1. Tap six swamps to add ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) to your mana pool.
2. Use two mana to play [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), targeting yourself. Sacrifice your [Shambling Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Swarm). The Edict and Swarm both go to your graveyard. Your graveyard has five cards in it.
3. When [Shambling Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Swarm) is put into your graveyard, its ability triggers. Put one -1/-1 counter on your [Slithery Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slithery+Stalker) and two -1/-1 counters on Worth's [Mystic Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Familiar).
4. Your [Slithery Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slithery+Stalker) is destroyed. The Stalker and the [Shade's Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shade%27s+Form) enchanting it both go to your graveyard. You have seven cards in your graveyard and reach threshold. Your [Repentant Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repentant+Vampire) becomes white, and your [Childhood Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Childhood+Horror) becomes a 4/4 creature. Worth's [Mystic Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Familiar) is destroyed and goes to his graveyard. Worth has seven cards in his graveyard and reaches threshold. His [Wayward Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayward+Angel) becomes a 7/7 black creature.
5. The second ability of [Shade's Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shade%27s+Form) and the leaves-play ability of [Slithery Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slithery+Stalker) both trigger and go on the stack. (It doesn't matter which order you put them on the stack; let's say you put the Stalker's ability on the stack last.) Tap your white [Repentant Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repentant+Vampire) to destroy Worth's black [Wayward Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayward+Angel). [Wayward Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayward+Angel) and [Druid's Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Druid%27s+Call) are both put in Worth's graveyard.
6. [Slithery Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slithery+Stalker)'s leaves-play ability resolves, returning [Aven Cloudchaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser) to play on Worth's side. The Cloudchaser's comes-into-play ability triggers, and Worth must destroy [Kirtar's Destire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kirtar%27s+Destire) since it's the only enchantment in play.
8. The ability of [Shade's Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shade%27s+Form) resolves, returning [Slithery Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slithery+Stalker) to play on your side. You have six cards in your graveyard and no longer have threshold. Your [Childhood Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Childhood+Horror) is 2/2 again. The Stalker's comes-into-play ability triggers. Remove Worth's [Angel of Retribution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Retribution) from the game.
9. Use four black mana to play [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire), targeting [Aven Cloudchaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser). It gets +2/-2 and is destroyed. [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire) goes to your graveyard. You have seven cards in your graveyard and reach threshold again. Your [Childhood Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Childhood+Horror) goes back up to 4/4.
10. Attack with [Childhood Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Childhood+Horror). Worth has no creatures with flying left, so he can't block. He takes 4 damage, and you win the game!
