### Two-Headed Giant Rules Change: Poison Counters

Effective April 1, the rules for poison counters in Two-Headed Giant games are changing. Players will no longer get poison counters individually. Rather, teams will get poison counters. In addition, a team loses the game when it has 15, not 10, poison counters. The Comprehensive Rules will be updated to reflect these changes.

**Two-Headed Giant Poison Mini-FAQ**

**Q:** Do these changes affect the way in which attackers are declared or combat damage is dealt in Two-Headed Giant?  
**A:** No. Each team's creatures, including those with infect, attack the other team as a group. Combat damage is still dealt to each player individually, although the result of that damage (from a source with infect) is the player's team receiving an appropriate number of poison counters.

**Q:** If the opposing team has one or more poison counters and I proliferate, how may poison counters can I give them?  
**A:** One. You choose the team as a whole to receive one more poison counter. This is a new exception to the normal proliferate procedure.

**Q:** If my team has one or more poison counters, will an opposing [Septic Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Septic+Rats) get its bonus?  
**A:** Yes. Both players on a team are poisoned if that team has one or more poison counters.

**Q:** Do these changes affect any other formats or variants?  
**A:** No. Two-Headed Giant is the only variant affected by this change.
