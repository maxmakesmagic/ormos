Some cards, like [Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silence), [Pyretic Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), and [Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes) just don't have practical applications for Limited. Sure, they might be put to good use in Constructed, but in Limited it is pretty much never worth it to spend a card for the effects that any of these cards offer. 

But then there are plenty of cards that might appear unplayable at first glance, but can actually be put to very good use in the right situations. While other cards just need a little bit of help to achieve their full potential.

Looking to maximize the effectiveness of some of the often dismissed cards in M11? Then read on!

What Makes a Card Unplayable in Limited
Back in the day, sets used to be full of "skill-tester cards"â€”cards that were so bad that even the most novice players would be able to figure out not to play them. [Chimney Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chimney+Imp) was a prime example of a skill-tester card. At the hefty price of five mana, even the mention of the name [Chimney Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chimney+Imp) would elicit some chuckles.
