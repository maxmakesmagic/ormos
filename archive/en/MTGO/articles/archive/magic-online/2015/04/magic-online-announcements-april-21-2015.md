**Super Tuesdays: An Interview with Randy Buehler**


The Standard Super League begins on Tuesday, April 28, just days after the Vintage Super League Finals come to a close on Sunday, April 26. No longer do fans have to wait for more league action between seasons. Super Tuesday will be a day that viewers can tune in to get their weekly dose of innovative decks and expert gameplay across a variety of formats, dependent on the current season.


How did the Standard Super League come to be? Where did the idea of the Vintage Super League originally come from, and what are the logistics of running a Super League? Randy Buehler was kind enough to speak with us about these questions and more in an [interview](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/super-tuesdays-interview-randy-buehler-2015-04-20).

**Build Notes**


**General**



* Building, Trade | We have increased the areas in which selections in one scene carry over to other scenes such as when deck building or trading. An example of this is if change your settings such that you build a Limited deck in List view, when you enter Sideboarding the List view selection will be maintained.
* Chat | Players can now copy/paste large amounts of text from the Chat area of the client without erroneous characters appearing.
* Collection | Fixed a crash that would occur when a player had an existing but invalidly named trade binder.
* Collection | Improved the speed and memory footprint of navigating to and from the Collection scene.
* Collection | The “Loading Card Collection” message will no longer display if the game is minimized during the loading process.
* Collection | When making a copy of a deck, the copies name now respects character limits for deck names.
* Duel Scene | Fixed a crash that would occasionally occur when a player was required to split damage.
* Duel Scene | We have reverted work done around how triggers were being automatically stacked. This change will allow players to properly stack triggers from cards such as Amulet of Vigor. If you want your triggers to stack automatically, F7 is the default hotkey for doing so.

* Store | Fixed a crash that would occur if a player navigated to the Store scene before the Store data was loaded.
* Trade | Fixed a crash that could occur when you were trading with the same trade partner as you had traded with previously.
* Trade | Fixed a crash that would occur when one player left a trade while the other player was interacting with the Trade scene.
