For months now we've been building up to the Super League Championship. Ten players have already qualified themselves for the twelve-person event, and the last two slots will be awarded in tonight's Last Chance Qualifier.

The field for the LCQ consists of the next highest finishers from the most recent Vintage, Standard, and Modern Super League seasons, plus the four players who won the [Fan Vote](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/super-league-last-chance-qualifier-2015-10-06). There were so many good choices for the fan vote that Kai Budde, arguably the best player in the history of the game, was the bubble boy—finishing fifth in the vote behind Reid Duke, David Williams, Kenji Egashira, and Luis Scott-Vargas.


Tonight we'll watch every match as these eight players try their hand at the new Standard format. It's single elimination with two spots available, so players just need to go 2-0 in order to come back for next week's championship. Here is the bracket that will determine their fates:

The players had to submit their decklists yesterday (before they knew who they would be playing). How did they all react to the results of last weekend's Pro Tour? Click [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/super-league-championship-last-chance-qualifier-decklists-2015-10-19) and see! Then tune in Tuesday, October 20, at 6:00 p.m. Pacific (UTC-7) on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) to see who wins. If you have a moment, we’d love for everyone who has ever watched Super League to take a [survey](http://www.mtgo.com/SuperLeagueSurvey) and tell us what you think of the show!
