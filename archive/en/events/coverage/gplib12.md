Grand Prix Lisbon 2012
----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gplis12/Ivan-Floch---Grand-Prix-Lisbon-2012-Champion.jpg)Over 1,300 players came to Lisbon for the last European Grand Prix of the year. *Return to Ravnica* was the set of the moment, with first sealed deck, then draft testing the skills of those vying for the title of Champion. The field gradually shrank as more competitors fell by the wayside, unable to keep up the winning pace required to lift the trophy. The finals saw Ivan Floch of Slovakia against Elias Watsfeldt of Sweden, with both hungry for victory.


The final verdict was from Ivan Floch â€“ [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) punctuating a three game set where his Azorius build splashing red was able to outmanoeuvre Watsfeldt's aggressive Rakdos deck, and secure victory for the former team World Champion.


The top eight, sporting such names as Johan Verhulst and two time GP Lisbon top eight competitor Helder Carvalho, was a powerful one, supported by a top 16 including Matteo Versari, Martin Juza and Shuhei Nakamura.


As the venue closes down here in Lisbon, we look to the final few events of the season in Toronto and Nagoya where no doubt we will see more fantastic **Magic**. For now though, it is a time to rest, reflect, and celebrate a great victory from our Grand Prix Lisbon 2012 Champion Ivan Floch.
