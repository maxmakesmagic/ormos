This year's *Commander* crop features five enemy color decks headlined by some pretty powerful enemy color legends. You've already seen [Kalemne, Disciple of Iroas](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/developing-commander-2015-2015-11-02), [Daxos the Returned](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/commander-and-conquer-2015-11-02), and [Mizzix of the Izmagnus](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/commander-2015-mechanics-2015-11-02), with more coming over the next few days.


But having powerful legends leading your forces into battle isn't enough—you have to have the support troops to pull it off.


So today, because I like you, I thought I'd throw out some extra previews of a few enemy color cards that you'll find marching alongside the powerful options on the front of the boxes.


Black-Green
===========

The Week That Was author Brian David-Marshall swears by this card and the dozens of Spiders it can create. This *Innistrad* favorite is back and ready to spawn a whole new group of Commander players who can appreciate its power.


White-Black
===========

Simple, effective, and deadly. This is a pretty good card to pump reams of mana into. Maybe from [Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg%2C+Tomb+of+Yawgmoth) and [Cabal Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Coffers)?


Green-Blue
==========

Value.


Red-White
=========

Sometimes, even your leaders need some heavy hitters at their side. [Gisela, Blade of Goldnight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gisela%2C+Blade+of+Goldnight) is a Commander favorite that hasn't seen print since *Avacyn Restored*.


Blue-Red
========

When you absolutely must say no—to everything on the stack.
