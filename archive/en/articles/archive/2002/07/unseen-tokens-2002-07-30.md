Art is commissioned for most tokens that are needed for recent sets, and most of that art appears on the [Player Rewards tokens](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/103) given out by the DCI. But not all of it.


Because ***Magic** Online* needs to physically represent all the tokens in the game, art needs to be created for even the most insignificant tokens. And for some of that art, [***Magic** Online*](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=magic/magiconline) is the only place it appears.


Below are three pieces of that art that was created for tokens from the *Odyssey* block. We'll come back later to look at the *Invasion* block tokens.
