**Magic** art takes many forms, but one of the coolest has to be the "ensemble piece" – an illustration that shows several recognizable elements from other cards all put together.


The original [Treasure Trove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Trove) from *Exodus* in one such piece. In it, the two characters Hanna and Karn are standing over a table full of artifacts. But those aren't just random objects – they are the Legacy, crucial to the saga of Gerrard and the *Weatherlight*, and most of them are actual **Magic** artifacts from other cards.


Down the left of the diagram, you can see:


* [Hanna, Ship's Navigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanna%2C+Ship%27s+Navigator) – finally printed in *Invasion*
* the [Skyshaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyshaper) from *Exodus*
* the [Thran Tome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Tome) from the *Weatherlight* expansion

Down the right:


* [Karn, Silver Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn%2C+Silver+Golem) – printed in *Urza's Saga*
* [Touchstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Touchstone) from *Weatherlight*
* the [Null Rod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Null+Rod), also from *Weatherlight* (which would theoretically prevent the other artifacts from working, Karn included.)
