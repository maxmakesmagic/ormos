 **Q:**  Every year, you guys take a few weeks off for the holidays. I was wondering when you were going to do your reruns and if you accepted public nominations for which articles to rerun?   
- Fabian R. 



**A: Trick Jarrett, Editor-in-Chief of DailyMTG.com**


We're going to be doing something unique this year. Rather than two weeks of reruns, I'm a sucker for punishment, so I signed the site up to run a special theme week for the week of December 17 through December 21. It will be "Magic Online Week!" But, because I am a benevolent dictator, I am giving that week off to our staff of writers and instead bringing in some other folks to hold down the fort and bring you some interesting insights into Magic Online. For the week of December 24 to December 28, we'll be running the reruns you know so well.


As for picking which articles are highlighted, we leave that decision to our authors, asking them which article they want us to rerun. But, if you have articles you especially enjoyed I'd love to hear about them! Message me on Twitter: [@TrickMTG](http://twitter.com/trickmtg).
