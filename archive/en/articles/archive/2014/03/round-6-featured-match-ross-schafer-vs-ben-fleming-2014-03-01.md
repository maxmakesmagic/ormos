Ross Schafer's previous finish was 12th at Grand Prix Auckland 2012 and was hoping to bring that up a notch with a Top 8 appearance this weekend. In that very same year, Ben Fleming also attained one of his two Nationals Top 8 appearances. Schafer was happy to bring Esper Control to the table, while Fleming was ready with Blue White Devotion.


**Game One** 


Schafer started off by discarding Fleming's [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) with [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) but found himself on the receiving end of a quick beatdown from [Cloudfin Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudfin+Raptor) and [Tidebinder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage).


He relieved himself of some pressure by using [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) but Fleming reinforced with [Frostburn Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird). In conjunction with [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), Fleming was able to get rid of two successive [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought).

However, Schafer was simply buying time to build up a huge [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) while baiting for more threats but Fleming was not about to overextend. Eventually, [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) reset the board but Fleming quickly bounced back with [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) and [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter).


 


 


Schafer reloaded with [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for four new cards, hoping that Fleming would be one devotion short of awakening the Sea God. That was not to be as Fleming revealed [Tidebinder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage) off the top, attacking for 9 damage and reducing Schafer to just 2 life. To make matters worse, Fleming had flipped over [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) from [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter), ensuring that victory would be his.

**Game Two**
Schafer's early [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) showed him Fleming's grip containing [Glare of Heresy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Heresy) and double [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay), a trio great sideboard cards against him. He eventually decided to discard [Bident of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa) instead. Having only reactive cards in his hand, Fleming could only activate [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and hit for three damage together with [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar).


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion)
With the knowledge that Fleming was light on threats, Schafer felt comfortable enough to use one of his two [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade)s to kill the opposing owl mid-combat, giving Schafer the chance to resolve a topdecked [Bident of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa).


Upon reaching six mana, Schafer recruited [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) on successive turns, which was answered by two copies of [Glare of Heresy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Heresy). Fleming then started to pick off the opposing soldier tokens, forcing them to attack into his [Tidebinder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage) using [Bident of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa).


Using the first of his two [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay)s to protect against Schafer's [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve), Fleming successfully resolved [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) and things began to go downhill for Schafer. Fleming's final card was the second copy of [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay) that Schafer had already seen, so he used [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) to bait it out with success. This allowed [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) resolve unopposed, exiling [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea).


The Gods were not with him though (but rather with his opponent), as Fleming plopped [Ephara, God of the Polis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephara%2C+God+of+the+Polis) and a replacement [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) onto the board. Even though Schafer did have [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay) to stop [Master of Waves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) later on, he soon succumbed to the the power of the Gods.
