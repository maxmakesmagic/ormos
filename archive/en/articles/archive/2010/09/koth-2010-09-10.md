Did you see the *Scars of Mirrodin* card that Mike Flores [previewed yesterday](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/td/107)? It was Koth of the Hammer, and it looks like this:

This generated a certain amount of discussion in the Twitterverse. Much of it was Flores himself (@[fivewithflores](http://twitter.com/fivewithflores)) arguing with Conley Woods (@[Conley81](http://twitter.com/Conley81)) about how good Koth actually is. The winner of that discussion remains to be seen, and we're going to skip it.


The *other* discussion was who could come up with the best Koth-related pun. Here, as far as we can determine, are the contenders.

[Top8Games](http://twitter.com/top8games) I am bracing myself for the Koth puns -- High Koth of Living, Koth of Doing Business, Opportunity Koth and so on.

[kirblar024](http://twitter.com/kirblar024) Opportunity Koth is definitely going to be an article title somewhere given the restrictions he puts on a deck using him

[dailymtg](http://twitter.com/dailymtg) Koth-Benefit Analysis? Koth Suppressant? American Kothic? You're right, that rabbit hole is deep and dark.

[allanhowls](http://twitter.com/allanhowls) I am drawn to the new planeswalker like a Koth to a flame. #SoM
