At the beginning of the day, of the original 1,208 only four players remained undefeated. After this round there would be but two: the winner of Christian Seibold's match against (1) Jérémy Dezani, featured on video, and the winner of this duel here.


 Here, Johan Verhulst met Raphaël Lévy. The former is no stranger to the feature match area, can often be seen on the second day of Grand Prix across Europe, and even made it to the Top 8 once, in Lisbon in 2012. However, if Verhulst is no stranger to the feature match area, then Hall of Famer and No. 22-ranked player Raphaël Lévy is practically at home there. 


Both players had drafted white cards, Verhulst pairing them with blue, Lévy working with green. Neither was particularly excited about his deck though.



**Game One**




 The early game saw some trades (Lévy's [Nyxborn Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Wolf) versus Verhulst's [Crackling Triton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Triton)) and some more drops to clog up the board ([Traveling Philosopher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveling+Philosopher) with [Nyxborn Shieldmate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Shieldmate) for Verhulst, [Nylea's Disciple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple) for Lévy), but the action really got going only once the players took to the air. Lévy was first with [Setessan Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Griffin) and [Loyal Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loyal+Pegasus), gaining an early lead in the damage race by repeatedly pumping his Griffin.






*No 22 Ranked Player Raphaël Lévy*

  

[Vaporkin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) blocked the Pegasus, however Lévy had [Battlewise Valor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Valor) to save it. Next, Verhulst got a 5/5 in [Ornitharch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornitharch), and took some more damage when [Setessan Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Griffin) acquired [Nyxborn Shieldmate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Shieldmate) and was pumped again. The 6/6 took him to 4.




 Verhulst passed his turn, then made Lévy stop: "In your upkeep ..." Lévy already knew what was coming and tapped his [Nylea's Disciple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple) and [Setessan Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Griffin) for Verhulst's [Sudden Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm), which left him with just [Loyal Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loyal+Pegasus). In the face of a 3/4 [Traveling Philosopher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveling+Philosopher), 5/5 [Ornitharch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornitharch), and [Deepwater Hypnotist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepwater+Hypnotist) that was not nearly enough and Lévy died before his creatures got the chance to untap again.




**Game Two**




 With the help of [Battlewise Valor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Valor), Lévy managed to keep his [God-Favored General](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Favored+General) around long enough to create two tokens, but, all too soon, Verhulst's [Coastline Chimera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coastline+Chimera) put a final stop to such shenanigans. Trying a new angle of attack, Lévy build up his air force with [Setessan Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Griffin) but was outclassed there as well, as Verhulst once again had [Ornitharch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornitharch).




 Then Verhulst cast [Hundred-Handed One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundred-Handed+One) and [Chorus of the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chorus+of+the+Tides), while Lévy played ... well, Lévy played more lands. He now had seven lands on the battlefield and had cast a grand total of three spells so far.






*Johan Verhulst*

  

[Feral Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Invocation) on [Setessan Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Griffin) and [Time to Feed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+to+Feed) on that same Griffin and [Hundred-Handed One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundred-Handed+One) offered a small reprieve, but when the [Feral Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Invocation) and Griffin were lost to [Griptide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide), the game was all but over. Verhulst attacked with his team and Lévy soon conceded.




**Johan Verhulst 2-0 (22) Raphaël Lévy**




 "My deck's okay but not great," said Lévy after its bad performance in the match. "Mine too," Verhulst replied. "I have some cards that— Well you saw the [Crackling Triton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Triton), for example."
