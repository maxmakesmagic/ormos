Uncommon Cube Starts Tomorrow
-----------------------------


In case you missed Alli Medwin's [article last week](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/cube-spotlight-series-%E2%80%93-uncommon-cube-2018-05-16), an exciting new offering is coming to *Magic Online*: the Cube Spotlight Series. Basically, we're going to be trying out interesting new cube experiments in one-week increments, testing novel concepts to see what works and what doesn't. The first cube in the spotlight will be Alli's own (uncommonly fun) Uncommon Cube. Check out the article for more info, and make sure to try the Uncommon Cube while it's available and let us know what you think!


 
Team Standard Super League Tonight
----------------------------------


There are so many Team Super Leagues going on these days, we can barely keep track, and the latest addition is Team Standard Super League! The format is a bit different from the "Conqueror" rules used for TMSL and TVSL, but the basics are the same: team-wide deck-building restrictions, rotating players, and weekly elimination tournaments. See what kinds of crazy brews these teams bring to the table in the world of *Dominaria* Standard!


TSSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/).


 
Three PTQs for the Three-Day Weekend
------------------------------------


**Saturday, May 26:** Standard, beginning at 9 a.m. PT. Players may enter with 30 Event Tickets or 300 Play Points. **Sunday, May 27:** *Dominaria* Sealed Deck, beginning at 7 a.m. PT. A red or blue PTQ Finals Entry Token is required to join this event. **Monday, May 28:** Modern, beginning at 9 a.m. PT. Players may enter with 30 Event Tickets or 300 Play Points.


That's a lot of Pro Tour qualifying for one weekend! With three different formats to choose from, every aspiring Pro Tour player should have a chance to play at their strongest. Each event's winner will qualify for Pro Tour *Guilds of Ravnica* in the fall.


Learn more about *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifiers [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-pro-tour-qualifiers).


 
Team Vintage Super League Thursday
----------------------------------


Get your weekly dose of ridiculously complex, powerful *Magic* every Thursday evening. The team-based deck-building rules and tournament structure make it even more interesting and unpredictable. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy TVSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about *Magic*'s most complicated format!



TVSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/format-details/).
