![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds06/Round5_Nassif_Rade.jpg)*Olle Råde, long famous for his flowing blond hair, switches strategies, attempting to blind Gabriel Nassif.*Two big names met in Round 5, ready to add some impressive **Magic** to their impressive resumes. Olle Rade was in the first Hall of Fame class, and came back to dish out his best with a storm deck based not around [Dragonstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstorm), but [Ignite Memories](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories) instead. Gabriel Nassif needs no big introduction either: He is a man whose next Sunday appearance should be due any event now. Both players were on a 3-1 record coming into this match.


### Game 1


While Gabriel played first, Olle had the more impressive start with double Suspend action: [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) and [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) appeared in his removed-from-game zone. It smelled like combo and Gabriel knew it, digging for permission with [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) but feeling safe for the moment because both powerful spells were still suspended.


Another [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) from Gabriel was met by [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) from Olle, who banked on his [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) coming in to boost his two-land manabase ([Rakdos Carnarium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Carnarium) and [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)). Gabriel had a [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) of his own for it, a powerful play which visibly set back the Scandinavian. But the Swedish Hall of Famer went for it, all in the same upkeep. [Clockspinning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning) allowed his [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) to resolve unimpeded while Gabriel was tapped out. With the help of [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), Olle played [Ignite Memories](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories) with a whopping storm count of five, putting six copies on the stack and hitting [Martyr of Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martyr+of+Sands) once, [Azorius Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Signet) twice, and [Muse Vessel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muse+Vessel) thrice.


That meant 17 damage to Gabriel, who could do nothing but take it like a pro. He raised his eyebrows as he looked at his hand. [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) and a white Martyr made his board, while Olle yet again suspended the dynamic duo of [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) and [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s. Looking quietly confident, he watched Gabriel play a second Martyr.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds06/Round5%20Nassif.jpg)*Hmmmm…*[Muse Vessel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muse+Vessel) from Gabriel fell to [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), and the two Martyrs went beatdown. On the second try, the Vessel resolved, followed by a third Martyr. Olle was reduced to draw-go, but never lost his smile, even when [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) hit his [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision). With the Martyrs on beatdown mode and two [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s suspended, Olle asked Gabriel to play a bit faster. The Frenchman complied, taking Olle to 6, then to 3, with his little white men.


Olle had one turn left to try and burn Gabriel out. [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) and [Ignite Memories](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories) were the last cards in Olle's hand, and they were just not enough.


Nassif 1 - 0 Råde


Afterwards, Olle mused that he could have won that game if he had played his land differently. With just one blue mana instead of any other, he could have [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)ed Gabriel's [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), which would have upped the Storm count by one and saved the [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) to generate even more storm.


The two players didn't think long about their sideboarding strategies. Gabriel brought in 2 [Muse Vessel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muse+Vessel) and 3 [Circle of Protection: Red](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Red), taking out the useless 3 [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn)s and 2 [Chronosavant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronosavant). Olle just swapped in some [Trickbind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trickbind)s for some [Clockspinning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning)s.


### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds06/Round5_Rade.jpg)*Olle plots a course.*Both players declined to go to Paris - no small wonder, since they were already there - but opted for power starts instead. Olle, playing first, suspended [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s on turn one and on turn two. Gabriel's [Martyr of Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martyr+of+Sands) and [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) looked pale in comparison, but when the first [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s was about to resolve, Gabriel had [Spell Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Burst) with buyback! Nice play against the suspend spells without an actual mana cost. Olle attempted to [Trickbind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trickbind) the buyback, which obviously does not work, so the Visions was gone. The very same [Spell Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Burst) nixed the next [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s, but not the [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) that killed Gabriel's Martyr.


The first batch of battle was over, now the question was: Who would put the pressure on? Gabriel had [Muse Vessel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muse+Vessel) and [Circle of Protection: Red](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Red). Bad times for Olle, who could merely muster a measly [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt).


The Bolt and [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) helped to make three copies of [Ignite Memories](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories), but with 13 life on Olle's side and 17 on Gabriel's, the Ignition was non-lethal. It hit a [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), a [Spell Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Burst), and a [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) and took Gabriel to nine. But even though the [Circle of Protection: Red](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Red) was Trickbound, the damage Olle could pile on did not suffice. When Gabriel revealed Wrath and [Proclamation of Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Proclamation+of+Rebirth) on a Martyr activation, Olle knew the game was over.
