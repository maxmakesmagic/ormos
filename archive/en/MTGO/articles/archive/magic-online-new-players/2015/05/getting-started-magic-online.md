Welcome to *Magic Online*! Here, you’ll be able to get the authentic *Magic* experience anytime, anywhere you have a computer and an internet connection. With opponents on-demand, daily tournaments, and a Game Support team available 24-7, there’s only a few simple steps separating you from your next duel. Crack open your [New Player Starter Kit](#starterkit), [build a deck](#deck), and [find a match](#match)!

Open Your New Player Starter Kit
================================



You've signed up for an account and downloaded the *Magic Online* client—all you need now is the instant collection that comes with your New Player Starter Kit.




---

The Collection Scene is where you can find the entirety of your *Magic Online* collection, as well as where you can search for cards you don't own yet—it's also where you'll find your Starter Kit! Click the other products tab to find your Starter Kit.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/open_starter_kit_1.png)


Right-click on the New Player Starter Kit and select "open 1 of these."


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/open_starter_kit_3.png)


Now, the contents will be added to your collection!

Check out the Collection and Deckbuilding [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9SJyUPh3-s#t=190) for a visual walkthrough of opening your Starter Kit and a guide to [navigating your collection](http://youtu.be/v9SJyUPh3-s?t=1m16s).

Build a Deck
============



One of the greatest things about *Magic Online* is the level of deck customization options that are available. The same copy of a card can exist in a hundred different decks if you wanted it to. No more worrying about finding deck boxes and sleeves—your digital collection will stay fresh no matter how many shuffles you run it through. But before you get lost in endless deck tinkering, you'll need to learn the basics. Ryan Spain, digital designer for R&D, wrote a great [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/editing-decks) on editing decks within *Magic Online*. The below text is an excerpt from that article.


If you prefer video tutorials, check out the [Collection and Deck Building](https://youtu.be/v9SJyUPh3-s) video. Feel comfortable with the Collection Scene already? Jump right to the [deck building portion](http://youtu.be/v9SJyUPh3-s?t=4m18s).

### Starting a New Deck


Once in the Colleciton Scene, you'll need to make sure you have "Cards" selected to view your full *Magic Online* collection and create a deck.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/make_a_deck_1.png)


You can start a new deck by clicking the “New Deck” icon in the lower left corner, or in the deck area if no deck is open. You can also double-click on a card or right-click on a card when no deck is open to start a new deck containing that card.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/make_a_deck_2.png)


### Building and Editing a Deck


To add cards to the open deck, you can double-click on a card in the Matches section, or right click on a card and choose one of the “Add…” options in the subsequent menu.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/make_a_deck_3.png)


Your deck will save when you navigate away from the Collection Scene or complete another action. If you are just tinkering and don’t want to overwrite your deck contents accidentally, right-click on a deck and choose “Open a new copy of this deck” in the menu.


If there are any problems with your deck given its format, you will see a caution icon next to the deck name. Right-click on the icon to view a list of the problems with your deck.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/make_a_deck_4.png)


Once you correct the listed issues, and the deck is legal in its selected format, the caution icon will disappear.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/make_a_deck_4.5.png)


You can sort and view your deck in different ways; explore the options by right-clicking in the deck area. You can also adjust the dividers between the four sections of the Collection tab, allowing you to customize your view.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/make_a_deck_5.png)


If your deck is constructed legally and all the cards in it are in your collection, there will be no caution symbol and you are ready to play. Head to the Play Lobby and find a challenger!
