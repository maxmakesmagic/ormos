 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 





2014 *Magic Online* Champion Magnus Lantto had been on a tear. After missing the 2015 World Championship Top 8 on tiebreakers, he fought his way to the finals of Grand Prix Madison the weekend leading up to Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*. Not too shabby coming into the opening Pro Tour of the competitive year.


Ryoichi Tamada, known for a pair each of Japan Nationals and Grand Prix Top 8s, was looking to finally break out at a Pro Tour. His success—and respect as a player—back home in Japan hadn't yet been matched by performance around the world. Now, sitting at 7-1 like his opponent Lantto, it was a chance to set up a Top 8 run on Day Two.


His heat might be just was he needed to put the chill on Lantto.

The Decks
=========


Lantto's take on Esper Planeswalkers was the direct descendant of the Esper Dragons of Standard past. Now with [Shambling Vent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Vent) and the new dual lands to keep the mana solid, the main decks featured reflected the new tools of *Battle for Zendikar*: [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths), [Ruinous Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruinous+Path), [Ob Nixilis Reignited](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ob+Nixilis+Reignited) and [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar). In lieu of any Dragons was [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) rounding out the ways to end games and stay ahead on the battlefield thanks to the suite of countermagic and discard around.


Tamada had a straightforward Jeskai deck. Unlike those adding [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) and other powerful black cards, Tamada doubled down on the classic Jeskai shell with full suites of [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider), [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way), and [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm). [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy—the standouts from *Magic Origins*—were joined by the four-of [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar). Packed full of threats and removal, Tamada looked to apply pressure nonstop.


The Games
=========


Both players took the early turns of the first game to set up, Lantto playing lands that didn't produce blue mana before drawing just two cards off [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths); Tamada opening up with [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar).


Lantto's [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) was met by [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm) and Tamada went into beatdown mode. [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) joined in, dropping Lantto to 8 life in the next attacks. Just [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) set to one blocked Gideon's next strike as Murderous Cut—cast at full rate—cleared the skies for Lantto.

Lantto dug again with [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths) for two cards, and made a [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) appear again. [Fiery Impulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Impulse) cleared the Thopter token for Tamada before he attacked with another [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider), and [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm) burned through the last life Lantto had left.


In the second game blue mana appeared early for Lantto, leading to a second turn Jace, Prodigy of Vryn. [Silkwrap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silkwrap) was Tamada's answer before making a Jace of his own. Gidion, Ally of Zendikar appeared for Lantto this time and the Knight Ally tokens began to appear.


[Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) crashed in for Tamada, after digging with Jace, but Lantto kept the pressure on with [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) making creatures hit harder. A second [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) was enough for Tamada to take out the Gideon and drop Sorin to just two loyalty.

Lantto went digging with [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths) for three cards, falling to 18 but rising back to 21 on the next attack. Tamada's [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider)s cleared Sorin and started chipping away at Lantto next, being joined by a [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) with two +1/1 counters. [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) for three counters was hit by Tamada's [Silkwrap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silkwrap) and things started to fall apart for Lantto.


[Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End) cleared one [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) as Lantto tried to rally back with another [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker). [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm) put it on top of the library and Tamada took a swing at the [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) Lantto tried as well.


After refilling off [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and looting with [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy), Tamada had it all: [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) finished off the opposing Gideon and adding his own was enough.


"Good game," Lantto said, the small army of Knight Ally tokens insignificant against the matching, and larger, [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker)s on Tamada's side.


**Lantto 0 – Tamada 2**
