Despite two Grand Prix last weekend, the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings have remained fairly stable. Nonetheless, it's easy to see where we should start this week, as our one new entry from the past seven days is also a Grand Prix Champion. Congratulations to Yuuki Ichikawa, the Japanese standout who went to China to compete in GP Shanghai, and came away with the trophy…and enough Pro points to place him on our leaderboard at No. 21. Now Christian Calcano, only weeks after claiming the title at Grand Prix Atlantic City, finds himself on the trap door once more, at No. 25.



The rankings were always meant to reflect who is being great at *Magic* right now, and the table is no respecter of reputations. Consider the two leading protagonists from the last Player of the Year race, Jeremy Dezani and Reid Duke. Dezani has long departed the Top 25, and Duke finds himself at No. 22, only a point above the drop zone. Duke had a frustrating weekend. Teaming up with Hall of Famers Ben Stark and No. 14 William Jensen, Grand Prix Florence saw them reach 8-1 on Day One. That run didn't last through Sunday, however, and they came away with a single point, a disappointing reward for a transatlantic trip.



This next week sees no premier event action, allowing players to get their reps in with the new set, *Modern Masters 2015 Edition*, which hits stores later this week. Then their practice regimes will be put to the test in three simultaneous Grand Prix in Japan, Europe, and the United States. What impact will Chiba, Utrecht, and Las Vegas have on the destiny of the Player of the Year title? We'll be the first to tell you right here at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
