Release Changes for Jumpstart: Historic Horizons and MTG Arena Updates

In [our State of the Game article for *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-jumpstart-historic-horizons-2021-07-29), we shared that we're working on a large change to some of our backend systems. As we've continued iterating and testing those changes, we've decided that we need a bit more time to get them ready for release. Unfortunately, the release of *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* is tied into this backend change, so we need to shift the release date for that as well.


What's Changing?
================


Here's the short version: we're moving everything out by two weeks. The release that was planned for August 10 is now expected to arrive on August 24, with *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* now scheduled for release on August 26.


We also need to delay adding the new Historic Brawl queue until this update as well, but for players looking forward to that, we will be adding a Historic Brawl event (with no entry fee) on August 12 that will run until the queue is available.


There are additional impacts here as well. Because *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* is now starting closer to [*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*'s launch on September 16](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/first-look-innistrad-midnight-hunt-and-innistrad-crimson-vow-2021-08-05), we're extending the duration of the *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* event to run until October 14 so there's plenty of time to enjoy both sets.


Updates to Ranked Play
======================


We also shared in the State of the Game that we would be splitting the August 2021 Ranked Season into two seasons. With this shifted release date, we're updating this plan as well: the August 2021 season is underway now through August 24, and the September 2021 season will run from August 24 to September 30.


Since we initially planned and announced this as two August seasons with two sets of rewards, we're instead combining the pack, card style, and gold rewards from both seasons into the new August 2021 Ranked Season so players can still earn everything we had previously promised—it will be an excellent time to finish with a Mythic ranking!


Though the season won't end until August 24, we're also standing by our decision that the first 500 players to reach Mythic by 7:00 a.m. PT on August 10 will receive invitations to participate in the October 9–10 Qualifier Weekend; the August 2021 Ranked Season will then continue as normal, with the top 1,200 Mythic-ranked players at the end of the season receiving an invitation as well.


You can [review all the details for the updated August 2021 Ranked Season](https://magic.gg/events/ranked-play-season) over on Magic.gg.


Summary of Ranked Play Changes
==============================


* August 2021 Ranked "Doubling Season": August 1–24
	+ Players can earn the combined rewards from the previously announced split August season. This applies to both Constructed and Limited.
	+ First 500 players on August 10 at 7 a.m. PT will receive an invitation to the next Qualifier Weekend in addition to the top 1,200 players at season end.
* September Ranked Reason: August 24–September 30
* October Ranked Reason: September 30–October 31

Premier Historic Drafts—First Entry on Us!
==========================================


Given the additional time until *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* arrives, we're also adding more Historic-themed Premier Drafts with a "twist" to help hold you over until *Jumpstart: Historic Horizon*'s release: the first time players join ***each*** of these drafts, ***we'll waive the entry fee!*** These Premier Drafts will run for about five days before changing to the next. Here are the sets making a return:


* [*Amonkhet Remastered*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/amonkhet-remastered) (August 10–15)
* [*Kaladesh Remastered*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/kaladesh-remastered) (August 15–20)
* [*Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/ikoria-lair-behemoths) (August 20–26)

Complete Summary of Dates
=========================


**First One on Us Historic Premier Drafts**: August 10–26


**No Entry Fee Historic Brawl Event**: August 12–24


***MTG Arena* Game Update**: August 24


***Jumpstart: Historic Horizons***: August 26–October 14


**August 2021 Ranked Season (with combined pack and style rewards)**: Now–August 24


**September 2021 Ranked Season**: August 24–September 30


***Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Release**: September 16


Excitement Awaits
=================


We know you build excitement and plans around the timelines we announce, and we try hard to stick to them. In this case, moving the dates was the best way to ensure that these large and important changes will provide a better experience for our players, and we hope the extra events will help make the wait for *Jumpstart: Historic* Horizons a little bit easier to bear.


Thank you for your patience for what comes next to *MTG Arena*!
