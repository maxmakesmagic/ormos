Here in the United States, tomorrow is the Fourth of Julyâ€”also known as Independence Day. It's the day we eat hot dogs, shoot off fireworks, and celebrate our nation's birth. If you don't live in the United States, chances are your country has a holiday much like it. So you'll certainly understand that we'll be taking today off. Sort of. Mostly.


While you won't get the full slate of articles today, we do have the full [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/magicorigins) up, featuring every card in *Magic Origins*. We also have an article from [Sam Stoddard over in Latest Developments](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/developing-origins-2015-07-03).


Enjoy, and Happy Fourth of July!
