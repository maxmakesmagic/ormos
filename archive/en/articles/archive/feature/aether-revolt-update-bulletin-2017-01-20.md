What better way to kick off the new year than by making some changes? And since these changes are for *Aether Revolt*, I should stick with the theme and throw all the rules out the window and rewrite them from scratch. Wait, no, I should absolutely not do that. What if instead I revolted by...hmm...also including the *Commander (2016 Edition)* rules and Oracle changes! Yes! I'm such a rebel.


Similar to the [*Kaladesh* update](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/kaladesh-update-bulletin-2016-09-30), we don't have anything big and game-changing, other than the new rules that change the game by letting new cards work. I briefly considered fighting the power by not making new cards work, but, you know, I am the power, and making new cards work is just so much fun. Read on if you're interested in fun rules quirks, arcane lore, and/or [Goblin Test Pilot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Test+Pilot)s.
