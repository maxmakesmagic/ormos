Interrupts that Target Permanents?

[Avoid Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avoid+Fate) and [Ring of Immortals](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ring+of+Immortals) are *Legends* cards that could, according to their printed text, counter interrupts or enchantments that target permanents you control.

*(What's an interrupt, you ask? The interrupt is an obsolete card type from before the rules change in 1999's *Classic Sixth Edition* set. An interrupt was similar to an instant, but it literally interrupted the normal rules regarding the stack and could generally only be targeted by another interrupt.)* 


Now, it's fine to counter a [Control Magic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic) or other nasty enchantment with those spells, but it wasn't very common for them to target interrupts. That's because not very many interrupts *could* target permanents. Spells that targeted spells, such as counterspells, and mana-generating spells such as [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) made up most of the interrupts at the time. There were a few exceptions, however.


Text-changers such as [Sleight of Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Mind) and [Magical Hack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magical+Hack) were interrupts that could target your permaments. [Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Red%2BElemental%2BBlast) and [Blue Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blue+Elemental+Blast) were also capable. So you could run a couple sideboarded [Ring of Immortals](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ring+of+Immortals) to fight those cards, I suppose...



### Interrupts to Instants


These days, though, all interrupts have been [Oracle](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=dci/oracle)-ized to become instants, and cards that affected interrupts now affect instants. This change *seriously* improved [Avoid Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avoid+Fate) and [Ring of Immortals](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ring+of+Immortals): they can now counter a [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) that targets your creature, a [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) on your enchantment, or an [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) on your artifact land.


Read more on interrupts in this [Ben Bleiweiss article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/bb27) from 2002, or in the [original **Magic** rulebook](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/jc20) from 1993! Happy New Year!
