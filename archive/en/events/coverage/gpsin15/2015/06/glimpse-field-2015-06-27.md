With over a thousand players in the room, it is not difficult to generate a pool of talent. These 30 esteemed players have more than 30 Pro Tour Top 8s and 150 Grand Prix Top 8s collectively.


They include Hall of Famers, Pro Tour Champions, Grand Prix Champions, World *Magic* Cup Champions and National Champions from all around the globe!


Here is an aggregation of what they have bought to the tournament today. It seems like there is a pretty even three-way split between Aggro, Control and Combo. This is a sign that Modern's diversity is unexaggerated, even though the popularity of Grishoalbrand is apparent.


A detailed Day 2 metagame breakdown will be brought to you tomorrow, so stay tuned!
