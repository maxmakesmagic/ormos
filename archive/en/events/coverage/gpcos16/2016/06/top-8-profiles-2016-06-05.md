**Age/Edad:** 23


**Occupation/Ocupación**: Merchant


**Hometown/Residencia:** Merida, Yucatan, México


**Previous Magic accomplishments/Logros Previos en Magic:**  

Winning a PTQ, unfortunately I could not attend because my Visa was denied.


  
**What deck did you play, and why?/Que deck jugaste y porque?**  

Green-White Tokens because I think it’s the best Standard deck at the moment.


  
**What changes would you make to your deck, and why?/Que cambios harias a tu deck, y porque?**  
[Angelic Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Purge) to sideboard for any other removal, like [Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone) or [Silkwrap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silkwrap).


  
**What's the most important card in your deck and sideboard?/Cual es la carta mas importante en tu deck, y sideboard?**  

In main deck, without a doubt, [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn), and then [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller). In the sideboard, [Tragic Arrogance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Arrogance) and [Planar Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Outburst). Gave me a lot of games.


**Are you in Costa Rica for business? Pleasure? Or is business pleasure?/Estas en Costa Rica por trabajo? Placer? O trabjando por placer?**  

I don’t know if playing Magic is considered a job, for me it’s more like a sport, so then I would say pleasure.

**Occupation/Ocupación:** Magic Grinder


**Hometown/Residencia:** Barcelona, Spain


**Previous Magic accomplishments/Logros Previos en Magic:**  

9th place Pro Tour Battle for Zendikar; 3 Grand Prix Top 8


  
**What deck did you play, and why?/Que deck jugaste y porque?**  

Green-White Tokens. Marc Samarra told me to stick with it.


  
**What changes would you make to your deck, and why?/Que cambios harias a tu deck, y porque?**  

Would change [Tragic Arrogance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Arrogance) for [Lambholt Pacifist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lambholt+Pacifist) — I love that card!


  
**What's the most important card in your deck and sideboard?/Cual es la carta mas importante en tu deck, y sideboard?**  
[Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn). She’s your defender and your finisher in one card. And the Pacifist lets you play Aggro more.


  
**Are you in Costa Rica for business? Pleasure? Or is business pleasure?/Estas en Costa Rica por trabajo? Placer? O trabjando por placer?**  

Pleasure. The business is casting Gideon!

**Age/Edad:** 36


**Occupation/Ocupación:** Trainer, Student


**Hometown/Residencia:** Panama


**Previous Magic accomplishments/Logros Previos en Magic:**  

Several times National Champion, Grand Prix Los Angeles Top 8


  
**What deck did you play, and why?/Que deck jugaste y porque?**  

White-Black Control. It’s a little clunky on the first three turns, but has massive spells for the late game.


  
**What changes would you make to your deck, and why?/Que cambios harias a tu deck, y porque?**  

One less [Linvala, the Preserver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+the+Preserver) in the sideboard, and one extra [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn). She is the real MVP.


**What's the most important card in your deck and sideboard?/Cual es la carta mas importante en tu deck, y sideboard?**  
[Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) AND [Linvala, the Preserver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+the+Preserver)


  
**Are you in Costa Rica for business? Pleasure? Or is business pleasure?/Estas en Costa Rica por trabajo? Placer? O trabjando por placer?**  

Came to play the game and see the world.

2 Grand Prix Top 8s  

2 Pro Tour Top 16s


  
**What deck did you play, and why?/Que deck jugaste y porque?**  

Bant Humans. Because Yuuya plays it and he’s a master.


  
**What changes would you make to your deck, and why?/Que cambios harias a tu deck, y porque?**  

I would add [Fevered Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fevered+Visions) to the sideboard.


**What's the most important card in your deck and sideboard?/Cual es la carta mas importante en tu deck, y sideboard?**  
[Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker), card is broken.


  
**Are you in Costa Rica for business? Pleasure? Or is business pleasure?/Estas en Costa Rica por trabajo? Placer? O trabjando por placer?**  

To get Pro Points. [Oliver needed three Pro Points this weekend to clinch Platinum.]

Green-White Tokens. Have you read [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) and [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar)?

**Age/Edad:** 25


**Occupation/Ocupación:** Professional Magic Player


**Hometown/Residencia:** Laurel, Maryland


**Previous Magic accomplishments/Logros Previos en Magic:**  

2 Pro Tour Top 8s; 4 Grand Prix wins; Current World Champion.


**What deck did you play, and why?/Que deck jugaste y porque?**  

Green-White Tokens. I think it is the default best deck.


  
**What changes would you make to your deck, and why?/Que cambios harias a tu deck, y porque?**  

I would play more [Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone). Three stones, and maybe cut a few of the sideboard cards.


  
**What's the most important card in your deck and sideboard?/Cual es la carta mas importante en tu deck, y sideboard?**  
[Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar) – the Planeswalkers are the key to the deck.  

Sideboard – [Tragic Arrogance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Arrogance), as you need a sweeper sometimes.


**Are you in Costa Rica for business? Pleasure? Or is business pleasure?/Estas en Costa Rica por trabajo? Placer? O trabjando por placer?**  

Just for Magic, and to hang out at Miguel Gatica’s house.

**Previous Magic accomplishments/Logros Previos en Magic:**  

5 Grand Prix Top 8s, 2 Grand Prix wins.


**What deck did you play, and why?/Que deck jugaste y porque?**  

Bant Company. I knew I was going to play either Bant CoCo or Bant Humans. Ended up playing the slower and grindier of the two.


  
**What changes would you make to your deck, and why?/Que cambios harias a tu deck, y porque?**  

None. Brad Nelson designed a great 75.


**What's the most important card in your deck and sideboard?/Cual es la carta mas importante en tu deck, y sideboard?**  

Boring answer, but [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company). With it, the deck would not exist.


**Are you in Costa Rica for business? Pleasure? Or is business pleasure?/Estas en Costa Rica por trabajo? Placer? O trabjando por placer?**  

All business. But business is good.

**Previous Magic accomplishments/Logros Previos en Magic:**  

Bunch of 12-3s, RPTQ Top 8


**What deck did you play, and why?/Que deck jugaste y porque?**  

Naya Tokens, with the additional red Planswalkers to trample the mirror and eat [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer)s.


  
**What changes would you make to your deck, and why?/Que cambios harias a tu deck, y porque?**  

Add more [Needle Spires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needle+Spires); it’s great.


**What's the most important card in your deck and sideboard?/Cual es la carta mas importante en tu deck, y sideboard?**  
[Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) to help smooth out draws and land my color-heavy ‘walkers.


**Are you in Costa Rica for business? Pleasure? Or is business pleasure?/Estas en Costa Rica por trabajo? Placer? O trabjando por placer?**  

Just here for Magic.
