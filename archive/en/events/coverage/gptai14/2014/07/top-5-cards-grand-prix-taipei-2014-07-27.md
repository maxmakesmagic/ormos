These were the cards that shaped the tournament, that sparked discussions and were the most debated, the cards that won games and turned Grand Prix Taipei into an event to remember.

### 5. [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen)


One of the most terrifying cards to encounter, [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) was witnessed wrecking havoc on varying board states all weekend. Whether you needed to create a force of flyers to close the game or to stabilize the board when you're behind, [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) does a great job. So few cards can effectively deal with the swarm of bees, [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) is one one of the best reasons to be playing with Forests in this format.






  




### 4. [Flesh to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh+to+Dust)


In a format where unconditional removal is prized, [Flesh to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh+to+Dust) was named one of the best black commons in the set. Despite it's slightly high casting cost, the ability to snuff out any opposing bomb at instant speed makes it an auto-inclusion in any black deck. Not only does it screw up combat math, [Flesh to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh+to+Dust) also kills any avatar, angel, dragon or beast, including [Ancient Silverback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Silverback), making the anti-regeneration clause randomly useful.






  




### 3. [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros)


Widely voted the best bomb rare in the set by a wide panel of pros, it is not difficult to understand why [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros) was named the best avatar. In a damage oriented set like *Magic 2015*, the ability to boost your entire army (even in death) while providing lifelink and first strike just seems really unfair. In fact, [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros) was in quarterfinalists Steven Setya's and Kazuyuki Takimura's 9-0 Sealed deck, allowing both of them to dominate the field on Day 1.






  




### 2. [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike)


While there is a consensus on what the best white common was ([Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits)), the opinion was divided for the red commons. World *Magic* Cup Champion Tzu-Ching Kuo has maintained that he values [Borderland Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Marauder) higher in the hyper-aggressive aggro deck and Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* finalist Nam Sung Wook decided that [Inferno Fist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Fist) was better. Regardless, [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) is definitely first pick quality and always makes the maindeck of any red deck. In fact, it is one of the few redÂ commona that you would consider splashing for if you had access to mana fixing cards such as [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) and [Verdant Haven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Haven), making it the most consistent choice every single time. World *Magic* Cup Champion 2012, Cheng-Yi Tung, was able use [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) to win the race in his quarterfinal match to advance to the Top 4.

### 1. [Amphin Pathmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amphin+Pathmage)


As far as blue creatures are concerned, [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern) and [Frost Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Lynx) may be the most consistent, but not the most important of this tournament. In the finals this weekend, it was [Amphin Pathmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amphin+Pathmage) that secured the win for Huang Hao-Shan. In the first game against Lyu, the appearance of [Amphin Pathmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amphin+Pathmage) in conjunction with his lack of lands prompted a concession. Even if Lyu did draw lands to summon creatures, the "unblockability ability" would render any defenses useless. In the other, it was [Amphin Pathmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amphin+Pathmage) that assisted Huang to push through Lyu's defenses, before powerful cards like [Nightfire Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightfire+Giant) and [Soul of Innistrad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Innistrad) could turn the game around. Congratulations Huang Hao-Shan, Grand Prix Taipei 2014 Champion!
