It's time for our weekly delve into the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. There were two Grand Prix last weekend, and both helped shape our new list. We began in [Madrid](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmad14), where 1,900 players came to try to solve the latest Modern metagame, including No. 2 Jérémy Dezani, and No. 5 Ivan Floch. Dezani was quickly in trouble, starting out 1–2 after his three byes, so the 1 pro point he ultimately secured for 66th place probably feels like a bonus. For Floch, his 3 points for finishing 10th is tinged with a sense of what might have been, with an unintentional draw earlier in the tournament eventually costing him a Top 8 slot.


A few hours later, the stars came out to play (alongside almost *everybody* else!) at [Grand Prix New Jersey](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpnj14), which threatened the 4,000 player barrier only twice breached before in Grand Prix history. Once again demonstrating that not all players are created equal, a full *ten* of our Top 25 scored points. To put that in context, that's ten out of the fifteen who attended finishing in the *top 2.5%*!!! Those who gained multiple spots as a result include Jacob Wilson, up two at No. 11; Sam Black, up three at No. 14; Brad Nelson, up two at No. 21; and Andrew Cuneo, who puts a buffer between himself and the Top 25 trapdoor, up two at No. 23.


That trapdoor is now open for World Championship competitor Yuuki Ichikawa, sitting perilously at No. 25. Above him, sandwiching Cuneo, are the two new entries this week. Gaudenis Vidugiris warmed up for his stint as Lithuanian team captain for the World *Magic* Cup with 3 points in New Jersey, bringing him in at No. 24, while once-Worlds finalist Jamie Parke enters at No. 22 thanks to his 52nd-place finish in the gigantic Legacy event.


This coming weekend, it's time to visit Canada for Grand Prix Ottawa, and you can join us again to see which of our Top 25 can climb the table in our next look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
