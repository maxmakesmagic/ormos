Well, the people have spoken and the winner is…


Concept #6 - "A humanoid elemental of moss supports itself with a hand against a dead tree. From where the elemental touches, it spreads wild regrowth."


Here’s how the run-off voting went:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **You Make The Card - Step 15** |  |  |
| A humanoid elemental of moss supports itself with a hand against a dead tree. From where the elemental touches, it spreads wild regrowth. | 1373 | 46.2% |
| A shambling plant-creature which can quickly grow large thorny spikes to protect itself. Afterwards it can shed these thorns, which make excellent weapons. | 980 | 33.0% |
| A Venus flytrap with an oversized mouth inhales a spell. Tubules emit the spell from behind; small buds are seen. | 620 | 20.8% |
| **Total** | **2937** | **100%** |

And here’s how the overall voting for card concepting went:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **You Make The Card - Step 14** |  |  |
| A humanoid elemental of moss supports itself with a hand against a dead tree. From where the elemental touches, it spreads wild regrowth. | 814 | 23.9% |
| A shambling plant-creature which can quickly grow large thorny spikes to protect itself. Afterwards it can shed these thorns, which make excellent weapons. | 479 | 14.1% |
| A Venus flytrap with an oversized mouth inhales a spell. Tubules emit the spell from behind; small buds are seen. | 371 | 10.9% |
| A lurching, hunched creature, completely covered in vines except his eyes. A huge malignant blossom protrudes from his back. His arm is strangling a wizard. | 330 | 9.7% |
| A growing fungus-type creature that can shoot spores from itself to enhance other creatures' strength. | 304 | 8.9% |
| A humanoid figure with skin made of bark, stag horns on head, and wood spikes on forearms. Surrounded by green aura. | 287 | 8.4% |
| A chaotic and grotesque mass of overgrowth that is spewing all sorts of deadly-looking vegetation that could be used to enhance nearby beings. | 240 | 7.1% |
| A green cactus-like creature. It feeds on magical energy, and can use this energy to give spines to other creatures nearby. | 237 | 7.0% |
| A sentient mass of thorned vines. The vines can either act as armor for friendly forces or strike against foes. | 192 | 5.6% |
| A humanoid figure that appears to be riding a clawed creature; they are one creature. They are composed of many green branches that are wrapped together and speckled with thorns. | 147 | 4.3% |
| **Total** | **3402** | **100%** |

Okay, now that we know the card concept, it’s time to make the illustration. And to do that, we need an artist. So, we took Mr. Babycake’s card concept to Dana Knutson, **Magic**’s Commissioning Art Director (the guy who chooses what artist get to do which card illustrations). Dana selected a number of artists that he felt were appropriate for the card and were willing to participate in the “You Make the Card” promotion (this process creates some extra work for them, as you will see). The artist that gets over a third of the vote (with a run-off if necessary) will earn the right to illustrate Mr. Babycakes. Deadline for this vote is Sunday, July 14th.


Without any further ado, here are the selected artists. Along with each artist is a sampling of their work to give you a sense of their style.
