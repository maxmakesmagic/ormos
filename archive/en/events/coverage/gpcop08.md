Congratulations to David Larsson Grand Prix Copenhagon Champion!


Going into Grand Prix Copenhagen there were 120 Red decks of the 610 player field. It seemed vaguely appropriate therefore, that we should end up seeing Red well represented in the top eight. Tomoharu Saito had made it undefeated until round 15 of the tournament with his red deck, and David Larsson had also been playing the part of the hot knife in the format, rather than the butter.


When the two met in the final, it was a contrast of sideboard plans, and one that favoured Larsson. The Swede, who made top eight in Pro Tour London, powered through thanks to flawless execution of a great plan, in order to be the one to deny Saito.


For those of you that still have a Nationals coming up, prepare for fire, because there is one deck in this format that is smoking hot right now.
