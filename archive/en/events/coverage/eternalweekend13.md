2013 Eternal Championships
--------------------------


Lim's Fish the Reel Deal in Philly!
===================================












2013 Eternal Championships
--------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/eternal13/trophyvintage.jpg)Eternal Weekend is in the books, and we have ourselves two new champions! Ari Lax, after years of near misses at high profile Legacy tournaments, managed to finally secure himself a title, winning the 2013 Legacy Championships on the back of Death and Taxes, wholly appropriate given the setting. The following day, at the Vintage Championship, it was Joel Lim playing Reel Fish deck that managed to best the other competitors on his way to becoming the winner of the 2013 Vintage Championship!


Given the high level of exposure that many of the more degenerate combo decks in both formats had seen in the weeks leading up to Eternal Weekend, it was incredibly fitting that the two champions would manage to win their titles wielding creature-based aggressive decks. Lax's Death and Taxes, with its aggressive and disruptive white creatures, has a lot in common with Lim's Reel Fish deck, which relies on aggressive Merfolk backed up with permission. These decks proved more than capable of defusing big combo decks like Sneak and Show, Storm, and Dredge, as they won playing "fair" **Magic** against an unfair field.


In the end, this weekend served as a great reminder that of all of the most broken things you can do in **Magic**, one of the most powerful things you can do is attack. With Grand Prix Washington DC on the horizon, you can guarantee that Eternal Weekend's results will have given potential players food for thought, and a much better idea of what to expect and how to combat it.


Again, congratulations to 2013 Legacy Champion Ari Lax and 2013 Vintage Champ Joel Lim, the victors of **Magic**'s Eternal Weekend 2013!
