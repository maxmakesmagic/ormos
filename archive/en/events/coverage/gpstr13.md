Grand Prix Strasbourg 2013
--------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpstr13/Strasbourg-Winner.jpg)Another weekend full of **Magic** is over. 1,365 players entered the fray Saturday morning, 172 of them made it through nine grueling rounds and came back on Sunday. Then, after another seven rounds, the top eight players gathered in the feature match area, including Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* champion Alexander Hayne who came all the way from Canada and last year's Grand Prix Chicago champion Jacob Wilson.


But Hayne and Wilson were not the only ones who'd traveled far to play here in Strasbourg, France this weekend. For some it was all about the pro points. With the professional season drawing to a close, Pro Player Club levels were at stake as were spots on various World **Magic** Cup teams.


For others, it was the format. Legacy proved to be as popular as ever, and certainly as diverse. Throughout the weekend, we saw a number of innovative decks, whether it was a crazy [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) / [Dream Halls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Halls) / [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) / [Enter the Infinite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enter+the+Infinite) concoction, a brew based on [Helm of Awakening](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Awakening) , or simply a new take on an old favorite like RUG.


The story of the tournament, however, was clearly the Danish version of Death & Taxes. The deck wasn't high on people's radar going into the weekend, but it sure is now. Teammates Michael Bonde and Thomas Enevoldsen both made it to the Top 8, playing the same version of the deck, with but three losses between them. Once in the Top 8, neither player lost another match except for the semifinal when Bonde lost the mirror match against Enevoldsen who went on to defeat Jacob Wilson in the final.


Congratulations to Thomas Enevoldsen, champion of Grand Prix Strasbourg 2013!
