This week's "Sketches" subject is [Rotlung Reanimator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotlung+Reanimator), a powerhouse from *Onslaught*. The art is a little difficult to make out on the card, so we'll look at it in more detail here.


### 1. Art Description


These are the instructions given to the artist, Thomas M. Baxa:


"Color: Black  
 Location: Aphetto Swamp  
 Action: A ZOMBIE has found the corpse of a CABAL CLERIC. The ZOMBIE reanimates the CLERIC by emitting some weird, thick smoke from its mouth."


### 2. Sketch


This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Thomas. 


It's easy to see what's happening here, even though the corpses arms are arranged in such a way to make it seem like it is struggling to get away. 


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of the final piece. Unfortunately, the brown and black palette causes the Zombie to blend into the background, and he comes off looking like he has huge demonic bat wings, especially when reduced to card size.


Hopefully you have some insight now into what the illustration is representing. 


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as you'll see it in booster packs.
