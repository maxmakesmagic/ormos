This week's "Sketches" looks at [Infernal Caretaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Caretaker), an uncommon black Cleric from *Legions*. The card was illustrated by Christopher Moeller, the man behind [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) and [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), among others.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist. The card was originally called "Mass Gravedigger":

"Color: Black  
 Location: Interior Aphetto city  
 Action: Show a Cabal Cleric peering into a magical portal which has formed in front of him. Through the opening evil images such as zombies or bat wing like creatures can be seen.  
 Focus: Cabal Cleric "

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Chistopher. 

The card originally acted like a sort of [Aphetto Dredging](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Dredging) variant, allowing you to return all creatures of a chosen type from your graveyard to your hand when flipped. Development changed it to just Zombies, so the creatures in the portal had to be changed to be primarily zombies. 

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. The larger bat-creature in the portal has been replaced by a zombie, and the cleric has been given rows of short horns to match the other Cabal Clerics in the set.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you'll see it in booster packs.
