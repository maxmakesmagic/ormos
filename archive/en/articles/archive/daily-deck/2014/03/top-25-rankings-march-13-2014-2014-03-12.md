There were a lot of record-breaking numbers in the world of **Magic** this past week, but most of them happened away from the Top 25 Pro Rankings. [Richmond](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gprich14/welcome) was the venue for the crazy-huge Grand Prix that saw over 4,300 competitors sleeve up their Modern deck of choice across an epic two days of competition. That *any* well-known names managed to claw their way to the Top 8 was impressive; that Oscar Jones, Jamie Parke, Josh McClain, Ben Friedman, and Luis Scott-Vargas all made it to the knockout rounds was frankly astonishing. 

 It wasn't to be a weekend for the big names, however. By the semifinals, only Jones was left, having defeated Josh McClain in the quarters. Even so, that performance was enough to make McClain our one major mover in the rankings this week. He has certainly taken advantage of his much-noted excellence in the Modern format, first barnstorming his way into the Top 25 during  [Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptbng14/welcome), and then leapfrogging Lee Shi Tian, Paul Rietzl, and Martin Juza up to No. 16 from his Richmond Modern performance. 

His conqueror Jones would himself be bested in the semifinals by Brian Liu, while Affinity players Vipin Chackonal and Michael Sigrist went at it in the other final four matchup. Chackonal emerged, but it was Brian Liu who came away with the title.

 So, on a weekend where most of the Top 25 were either buried under the weight of 4,303 competitors, or were taking a well-deserved weekend off, Jérémy Dezani remains on top of the pile, with a stack of American talent hot on his heels. Join us again next week for another look at the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings.
