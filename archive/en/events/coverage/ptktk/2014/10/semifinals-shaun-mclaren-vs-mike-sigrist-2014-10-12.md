 By definition, it doesn't get much more stressful than the semifinals of a Pro Tour. Besides the finals of a Pro Tour and maybe the Player of the Year tiebreaker match being Brad Nelson and Guilluame Matignon in 2011, there's nothing that can top the drama. There's so much on the line that it's easy for players to tighten up in the pressure of the moment and the tension is palpable as half a dozen people surround the table to spectate a match of *Magic* that tends of thousands more are watching live across the world.



But there's another side to the Top 8 of a Pro Tour, and it's one that didn't escape No. 8 Shaun McLaren or his semifinal opponent Mike Sigrist.


"You're always so happy, like I am," Sigrist commented as the two waited for the match to begin.


"We're in the Top 4 of a Pro Tour, how can you not be happy?" McLaren replied rhetorically. 




*While both players were happy to have come this far, the tournament wasn't over yet and both had their eyes on the trophy.*
