How long have you been playing Magic ?


For about 5 years now.


What are your biggest Magic achievments to date ? 


I finished 9th at GP Copenagen, as well as making top 8 at Europeans.


How do you feel about the Swedish performance at this Championships?


Well there are 2 in the top 8 which is really great. We draft 2 or 3 times a week, but we did virtually no type 2 testing before this tournament.


How do you feel about your matchup tomorrow against Joost Winter?


It's an okay matchup, but strange things can happen. I have never met Joost befre but he is obviously a good player or he wouldn't be in the top 8.


What are your plans for the rest of the night?


I tend to have trouble sleeping anyway, so I will playtest until I am ready, then try and get some sleep.


Who is your favourite to win the Tournament?


I think that right now, the top 8 is very open.
