The October 9, 2017 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 9, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [*Magic* World Champion William "Huey" Jensen](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2017wc)! He put on a true master class throughout the tournament, and his victory is as well-deserved as it could be. (Congratulations also to all the members of Musashi, winners of the Team Series Championship!)


Today's Must
============

In case you missed it amid all the World Championship excitement, over the weekend we revealed the new logo for *Magic: The Gathering*! The updated, modernized logo will roll out on new *Magic* products beginning with the release of *Dominaria* in March of 2018—but never fear, the classic card backs will remain unchanged.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Much Abrew: The Pirate God (Standard)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/much-abrew-the-pirate-god-standard?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

You may have realized that [The Scarab God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God) is a pretty good card. (I think my cat has even realized that, and he only plays Legacy.) But did you know it was destined to lead a Pirate army to victory over the desert and the high seas alike? SaffronOlive built and tested a deck of blue and black Pirates with [The Scarab God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God) as their captain, and the results are pretty convincing.


1. [Where Are They Now?](https://mtg.one/where-are-they-now/) | MTG.one | Phil Feichtner

Like all the rest of us, Phil has been wondering what happened to some famous figures from *Magic*'s past. Over the weekend, he sat down with Tibalt, Jhoira, and (yikes!) Yawgmoth himself to discuss what they've been up to since they last appeared in *Magic* lore. And, of course, to gossip about other figures from the Multiverse. (Bolas, you really should return Tibalt's phone calls. That's just basic courtesy.)[​](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtU6U5Cf6g)


1. [Mental Edges: Don't Look at the Standings](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/mental-edges-dont-look-at-the-standings/) | ChannelFireball | Will Jonathan

In *Magic*, especially at the highest competitive levels, tiny decisions can be the difference between winning and losing. And that doesn't just apply to gameplay decisions. Will makes the case that one such decision is whether to keep track of your points and position in the standings during a tournament—and argues that ignoring those things as much as possible will give you a much better chance of coming out ahead.


1. [Can We Play Control in Standard Still? How?](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35969_Control-Options-After-Ixalan.html) | StarCityGames.com | Shaheen Soorani

Looking back at the World Championship and the previous weekend's SCG Tour tournament in Dallas, Shaheen sees control decks as poised to dominate the Standard metagame. Specifically, Grixis Control, which gets to utilize the power of [Hostage Taker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostage+Taker) and [The Scarab God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God) while backing them up with red's powerful two-mana removal like [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) and [Abrade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrade).


1. [The WTF Commander Deck Challenge](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/the-wtf-commander-deck-challenge/) | Gathering Magic | Abe Sargent

Regular Commander players (hello, my people!) are largely familiar with the staple cards of the format—those that, by default, tend to wind up in any list that can run them. [Sol Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring), [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum), [Vindicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate), [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) . . . the list goes on. So Abe set out to create an entire Commander deck of obscure or forgotten cards (helmed by [Livonya Silone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Livonya+Silone), of all creatures). His list is worth a look whether you play Commander or not. I saw some cards in there whose existence I really had forgotten completely!


What to Watch on Wednesday
==========================


1. <https://www.youtube.com/embed/ztZUqS7KLTA?rel=0>

It's almost time for the Standard Scuffle! Be sure to tune in to [twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun](https://go.twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun) on Wednesday, Oct. 11 at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET/11 p.m. UTC to see the crew duke it out with the tribes of *Ixalan*!


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [SWPC's Blue-White Tokens](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-ptq-2017-10-08)

While the World Championship was World Championing over the weekend, a PPTQ was also under way on *Magic Online*. Twelfth place went to a Blue-White Tokens deck that looks to go wide quickly, then pump up the army with [Angel of Invention](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Invention) and [Temmet, Vizier of Naktamun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temmet%2C+Vizier+of+Naktamun). It's also able to shift nimbly into a more reactive/controlling mode thanks to a sideboard full of things like [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), [Jace's Defeat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Defeat), and [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate). Also, one beautiful copy of [Skywhaler's Shot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywhaler%27s+Shot), because you always need to be ready to deal with skywhales.
