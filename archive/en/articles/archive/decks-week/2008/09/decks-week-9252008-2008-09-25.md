After a break from the Pro Tour to focus on his studies, Japanese superstar Masashi Oiso roared back to victory at his own National Championships this past weekend! In this installment of Decks of the Week we look at that Top 8. In addition, as a bonus jumping off point for States preparation, we've also got the Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ) lists as well as all the other decks from the 2008 Japan National Championships. And of course a look back at the **Magic Online** Premier Event lists from the past week. (Special thanks to Level 3 judge Takeshi Miyasaka for typing up and translating all the Japan Nationals decklists.)

Enjoy!
