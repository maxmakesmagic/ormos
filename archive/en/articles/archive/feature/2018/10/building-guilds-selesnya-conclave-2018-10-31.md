 Chris is the copy editor for DailyMTG. If the Ts are dotted and the eyes are crossed, he dun goofed. 






For every set we release and every world we visit, the Creative team creates a world guide that covers the history of the groups and characters living on the plane. The concept sketches in the world guide are then used by the talented artists from around the world to realize the creative vision for the set and give life to the cards.


To create *Guilds of Ravnica*, the Creative team revisited the guilds, updating their typical outfits for Ravnica's current weather (autumn) and filling in details on leadership changes and new character developments based on the overarching storyline.


In the gallery below, you can see just a few of the pages this team created to guide the artists as they brought *Guilds of Ravnica* to life. Enjoy!

The Selesnya Conclave are a harmonious union of nature and civilization who dream of embracing all of Ravnica in peaceful cooperation. In the meantime, though, they are growing an army, preparing to resist the ambition and destructive impulses of the other guilds and fight, if necessary, to defend their way of life.
