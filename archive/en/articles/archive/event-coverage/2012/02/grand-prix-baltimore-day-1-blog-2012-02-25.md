Round 2: Feature Match - Charles Gindy (UB Control) vs. Aubrey Morin (UB Zombies)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Marc Calderaro* 

"My history against you is not good, Charlie," Morin said, smiling as he sat down. These two dueled at Grand Prix Orlando, and the Floridian five-time Grand-Prix Top 8er, blew Morin out of the water game three by keeping in [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s and taking out a [Sword of War and Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+War+and+Peace) at the critical moment.


Morin hoped to use his zombies to redeem himself, but a bunch of planeswalkers and endless removal stood in his way. After winning the roll things were already in his favor.


### Game 1


Morin led with two [Darkslick Shores](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Shores), a [Diregraf Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Ghoul), a [Fume Spitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fume+Spitter) and a Gravecrawler. Gindy calmly laid down a [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb), threatening all of them and sunk to a quick 13. He took out the zombie hordes with the Bomb, then [Dissipate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate)d the turn-three Geralf's Messenger. The next two threats were hit by [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip) and when Gindy laid down [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) and activated her plus ability, Morin was handless. Handless by Gindy's fourth turn. This would be an uphill battle for Morin.


Gindy started his kill mechanism â€“ [Nephalia Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard), and just started going to town. Morin landed a [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod) and said, "I definitely have effects before your main phase," while staring at Liliana's six counters. Morin gained momentum with a Gravecrawler (brining back the previous one) and chained the grave parade to take out the planeswalker. However Gindy was still at 12 with a [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice), [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and a second Liliana in hand.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpbal12/fm3%20Aubrey%20Morin.JPG)
*Aubrey Morin*

The Leak took out the second Geralf's Messenger and then the Liliana II cast a [Cruel Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Edict) to slow down Morin's zombie assault. This is the resiliency of this zombie deck. Morin had been playing off the top since turn five and now Gindy was at 5.


Gindy was sick to death to taking out Gravecrawler after Gravecrawler and right after he finally took both out, Morin smirked, "You're not going to be very happy," and cast a third one. Black Sun's Zenith sent them packing (but not before [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod) took Gindy to four) and Morin was left sitting on two [Phantasmal Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image)s but nothing to imagine.


A couple turns of blanks on both sides and Morin was at 21 cards left in his library. Now Gindy was nabbing six cards at a time thanks to a second Drownyard, and had a good amount of cards banked in his hand. On Morin's last turn, with seven cards in his library, he cast an empty Geth's Verdict to take Gindy to 3, but the bevy of Gindy's removal and counters didn't allow Morin to stick a Diregraf Captain long enough to copy and throw, copy and throw.


Charles Gindy 1 â€“ 0 Aubrey Morin


Gindy was playing a typical UB Control deck, his flairs were a full four [Nephalia Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard)s and a couple extra planeswalkers with a [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) in the main.


He admitted that Zombies was definitely one of his hardest matchups and winning the pre-boarded first game was a boon. He sided out all his counterspells in favor of more threats. I'm not a doctor, but I think more [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Karn%2BLiberated)s = more lulz.


### Game 2


Gindy shook his head and chuckled when he kept a hand of Curse of Death's Hold two land, two [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb), and two [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated).


"I'm about to [Distress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress) you, so I can laugh too." Morin cast [Diregraf Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Ghoul) then looked at the weird amalgamation of cards in Gindy's hand and laughed so heartily he almost forgot to take a card at all. Gindy politely reminded him. It's not that those are bad cards, they're just, well, specific. Hopefully the [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb)s could delay until the Curse, which could delay until the [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Karn%2BLiberated). But that's a pretty soft keep, I think.

*Charles Gindy*

Morin followed his Ghoul and [Distress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress) with a [Cemetery Reaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cemetery+Reaper). Gindy cast concurrent [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb)s using one on the Ghoul and then the other on the [Reap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap)er, and was sitting at 10. The turns went by quickly as Gindy kept magically hitting his land drops. His bombs successfully delayed at least a bit.


On turn six he confidently tapped out for a [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) into an empty board. "I sure hope you boarded out all your removal."


"The life of Charlie Gindy: he keeps a two-land hand and casts a turn-six Sphinx." Morin frowned. He frowned harder when Gindy untapped, top-decked yet another land and cast [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated).


"The life of Charlie Gindy..." Morin extended his hand.


Charles Gindy 2 â€“ 0 Aubrey Morin




Round 4: Feature Match - Michael Jacob vs. Kyle Dembinksi
---------------------------------------------------------


*by Dane Young* 

### Game 1


Kyle Dembinski was set to play the exact same deck as his friend Michael Jacob, but Michael talked him out of it. Now here they are, playing against each other after taking their three byes. Michael quickly took a trio of mulligans before starting the first game while Kyle shuffled his opener in silence.


"See, aren't you glad you're not playing this deck?"


Surprisingly upbeat in the face of his severely diminished starting hand, MJ [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed and snap-kept the cards where they were while Kyle ramped up with [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), [Avacyn's Pilgrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Pilgrim) and Faithless Looting. MJ was impressed by the [Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elesh+Norn%2C+Grand+Cenobite) and [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) that hit the bin, but he had the [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) for the reanimation spell the next turn.


Lingering Souls and the backside of Faithless Looting kept Kyle in the driver's seat, binning a second copy of [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) that successfully brought [Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elesh+Norn%2C+Grand+Cenobite) back from the dead next turn. MJ took a hit from the spirits, but [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) made Kyle start from scratch as he tried to climb back into the game.


[Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) was a fine restart for Kyle, dropping MJ to 7, but it had to stay home for a turn after MJ cheated out his own [Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elesh+Norn%2C+Grand+Cenobite) with [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites). Michael had a turn to find a way to punish Kyle, but he was only able to fire off a few card drawing spells and pass the turn. Kyle's second Faithles Looting found him his third [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) to legend rule the opposing Elesh Norn, letting [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) rumble in for the kill.


Kyle 1, Michael 0



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpbal12/fm4%20Kyle%20Dembinksi.JPG)
*Kyle Dembinksi*

### Game 2


This time it was Kyle's turn to mulligan, but not wanting to be too fair and friendly, he only took one. MJ's [Nihil Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb) put a damper on Kyle's plans, but he did what he could with [Avacyn's Pilgrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Pilgrim) into Lingering Souls, giving him at least a semblance of pressure.


[Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) and [Pristine Talisman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pristine+Talisman) were a bit of a safety net against the little army, but Kyle went large with Wurmoil Engine. It drew an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) and was quickly replaced by [Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elesh+Norn%2C+Grand+Cenobite), prompting MJ to blow up his uncharged [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) to avoid a big hit.


MJ's own Elesh Norn cleared the board again as Kyle struggled to find the right colors of mana. He [Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch)ed into a Copperline Ridge, but he was behind the pace as MJ had his defenses in place. MJ offered a glimmer of hope when he let [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) resolve and subsequently attack for 10, dropping him to 7 in a hurry, but [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) on Elesh Norn enabled a trade with Michael falling to 5. Out of gas, Kyle had to pass the turn after losing his graveyard to [Nihil Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb).


[Sun Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan) brought back [Phantasmal Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image), which brought back the [Nihil Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb), and Kyle couldn't find a way to top the titanic duo.


Kyle 1, Michael 1



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpbal12/fm4%20Michael%20Jacob.JPG)
*Michael Jacob*

### Game 3


It was a slow start for Kyle with just an [Avacyn's Pilgrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Pilgrim) and Lingering Souls, which MJ wiped away with a [Whipflare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipflare). MJ sculpted his game plan with [Desperate Ravings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings) and [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) while keeping Kyle from ever really establishing himself, keeping the board clear with sweepers before playing [Jace, Memory Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept) onto an empty board. The Planeswalker got to work on Kyle's library after MJ set up [Nihil Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb) with a couple of [Dissipate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate)s to support it.


[Memory's Journey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory%27s+Journey) was the last card in Kyle's deck, but it a big [Blue Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blue+Sun%27s+Zenith) made sure it didn't matter as MJ made Kyle draw too many nonexistent cards to take the match.


Michael Jacob wins the match 2-1




Saturday, 5:15 p.m.: The Shifting Sands of Standard
---------------------------------------------------


*by Dane Young* 

Before Brian Kibler won Pro Tour *Dark Ascension*â€”defeating Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa in a 75-card finals mirror match featuring ChannelFireball's deck of choiceâ€”the Standard format was dominated by [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) decks that ate traditional control decks for lunch. ChannelFireball's dedication to beating Delver decks has turned the format on its ear, causing a huge shift in the balance of the metagame.


Even with Jon Finkel and Jelger Wiegersma piloting updated Delver decks to great finishes in Honolulu, it seems to be a well-known fact in the **Magic** community that a [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) deck is an underdog against Huntmaster of the Fells. That knowledge has seemed to slow the format down, causing many Grand Prix Baltimore players to choose U/B Control decks as their weapon of choice as they look to turn the Hunt(mast)er into the prey.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpbal12/hand%20spread.jpg)

Choose your weapon:


[Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls), [Gravecrawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravecrawler), [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), [Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elesh+Norn%2C+Grand+Cenobite), [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites), [Huntmaster of the Fells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells), [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets)




Another large segment of players have taken a less subtle approach to the issue, adopting Raphael Levy's Frites, a Reanimator-style deck built around filling its graveyard and using [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) to cheat a quick bomb into play. Several of the deck's pilots have mentioned that they are not favored against U/B Control, but that the deck is too fun and powerful to not play anyway.


That leaves the aggressive decks to split the remainder of the field between themselves. Whether it's [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) (with or without Lingering Souls), Huntmaster of the Fells, [Stromkirk Noble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Noble), Gravecrawler, or [Dungrove Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dungrove+Elder), Standard has suddenly turned into a rough place for creatures between Frites' package of [Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elesh+Norn%2C+Grand+Cenobite), [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) and [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine), and U/B Control's [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan)s and [Black Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith)s.


It's still early in day one, so we'll find out how thing shake out as Grand Prix Baltimore rolls on. Which side of the metagame are you on?




Round 5: Feature Match - Matthias Hunt (Frites) vs. Ryan Bogner (UB Zombies)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Marc Calderaro* 

Ryan Bogner is coming off his first Pro Tour appearance, which he finished in the Top 50. Qualifying via Planeswalker Points, Bogner had a very impressive first showing and is looking to do the same here. Since Matthias Hunt was a little late to the match, we joked that Hunt was scared and probably wouldn't show at all. This is funny, you see, because the reigning Rookie of the Year was clearly not actually scared, folks. You don't get to be RotY by being scared, ya dig? Ok, so it wasn't really funny but they can't all be winners. Jeez, get off our backs here.


The two sat down, introduced themselves, shook hands and shuffled up for the match.


### Game 1


Hunt led with [Copperline Gorge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copperline+Gorge), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and Lingering Souls. Bogner cast and Gravecrawler which traded with a 1/1 Spirit then cast a [Skirsdag High Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirsdag+High+Priest).


"Ready for this one? [Spectral Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession)!" Hunt cast three Avacyn's Pilgrims and made the totals 19-16 in his favor.


Bogner responded with another High Priest, but no third land. Hunt made a substantially spicier play on his own turn: The ol' tap-all-my-guys-for-turn-four-[Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elesh+Norn%2C+Grand+Cenobite) play. Gets 'em every time. "Let's see if you have the [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade)."


Bogner exhaled and sat; he didn't. And Hunt took a quick game one.


Matthias Hunt 1 â€“ 0 Ryan Bogner



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpbal12/fm5%20Hunt.JPG)
*Matthias Hunt*

### Game 2


After Bogner started with a [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod), Hunt asked, as his [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) hit the bin, "Oh, so are you just going to kill all my mana birds this time? Is that your game plan?"


"Seems like a pretty good one." Bogner then proceeded to cast Geralf's Messenger into double Drogskol Captain and then attacked Hunt down to six. Apparently that wasn't Bogner's only plan. He also had the Really Big Zombies That [Drain Life](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life) When They Die plan.


"Wow. Ok, so if I kill your guys I'll lose, 2, 3 â€“ wait, I can't even kill your guys without dying. That's no good." Hunt scooped up his cards are the scores became tied.


And with that, the first two games were over in eight minutes. And to think, Hunt asked me how much time was left when he sat down.


Matthias Hunt 1 â€“ 1 Ryan Bogner


"Hmm, I see what your plan is against me, and it seems pretty good. If you don't let me drop Elesh Norn, it makes it hard for me to win." Hunt has clearly grasped the crux of this matchup. Generally speaking, the Hellraiser-looking praetor is bad news when it's on the opponents side of the board, unless it was put there by an Evil Presents or something. Come to think of it, even then it's still pretty good.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpbal12/fm5%20Bogner.JPG)
*Ryan Bogner*

### Game 3


Hunt started unsurprisingly with a mana "bird" (really a mana Avacyn's Pilgrim), then cast [Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch) into a couple land and ditched a Lingering Souls in the graveyard. Bogner started slower than usual, just killing the "bird" with a Geth's Verdict, then followed with the standard turn three Geralf's Messenger. Hunt got two tokens and cast another [Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch) which filled up the graveyard nicely. Though Hunt had an [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) in the bin, he had nothing to unbury.


Hunt fixed that by skipping his land drop, staying on eight cards in his hand, and then discarded [Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elesh+Norn%2C+Grand+Cenobite). Bogner was quite prepared for that and cast a [Surgical Extraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction) to whisk them all away. Bogner followed with a [Phantasmal Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) copying the Messenger forcing a "Wow" from Hunt when he realized he was already down to 12. Hunt skipped another land drop to ditch his [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) to reanimate, but Bogner just flashed a [Nihil Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb).


"Well, if you're prepared, you're prepared." Hunt slumped in his chair.


He drew his cards for a couple more turns, but the combination of having no graveyard, no Elesh Norns, and being two land behind (by choice) pretty much put him out for the count. It took two more attacks for Hunt to pack it in.


Ryan Bogner advanced to 5-0. A solid start with an increasingly impressive deck.


Ryan Bogner 2 â€“ 1 Matthias Hunt


"I have to start declining feature matches. I literally think I'm 1-9." I did some research and it's true that the reigning Rookie of the Year's track record in feature matches isn't as good as his resume would boast. Well just for that, I'm going to feature him more so that you can all see how solid of a player he is! Or wait, is that going to work?




Saturday, 5:30 p.m.: The Card Bazaar - The GP From the Eyes of the Dealers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Marc Calderaro* 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpbal12/long%20hallway.JPG)
*"...That's a lot of dealers..."*

See this really, really long hallway? It's completely filled with dealers. That's a lot of dealers. This long hallway of cards is one of my favorite aspects unique to constructed **Magic** events. The sheer immediate card demand for 1,556 players means that this hallway can support all these dealers. And it's easy to get a grand layout of the tournament by picking their brains. They know what people are buying and they know what people aren't buying. I took a stroll down this [Gnat Alley Creeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Gnat%2BAlley%2BCreeper) (yes I was a little bit creepy) and gleaned some nuggets of info off these wise gents.


For example, they can easily answer what colors people are playing. After a few words with Julius at the CoolStuffInc.com table, he pointed at the empty dual land spots. [Darkslick Shores](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Shores) and [Drowned Catacomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowned+Catacomb)s were nowhere to be found. This was the same story at table after table. Joe and Joey over at StarCityGames also talked about how [Seachrome Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast) was really tough to keep in. With the imminent fear of a Blue and Black tide overcoming this tournament like a wave, the low numbers of lands quite confirmed it.


However, you can't assume those lands are going to be used for control. Because although Havengul [Lich](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich) is out at a couple stores and over at **Magic** *Stronghold* they're out of [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) because "everyone plays one [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Karn%2BLiberated) in their sideboards," the vast majority are out of [Phyrexian Obliterator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Obliterator)s. Yup, the card that was supposed to be good, then it was bad, then ok, then bad again, seems to be back on the upswing. The UB Zombies list (similar to the one Nate Chafe used to earn three byes last night) seems to have a strong presence. Though whether they're the real deal remains to be seen. Geralf's Messengers keep flying off the shelves, and as **Magic** *Stronghold* also extolled, so are Demon tokens (the product of a [Skirsdag High Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirsdag+High+Priest), some minions, and some morbid lovin'). As a side note, *Stronghold* also said most of their Angel tokens are gone too.


A couple venues have run out of Hellriders and [Surgical Extraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction)s. As the 3/3 Devil is my favorite card in *Dark Ascension* I hope to see some copies at the top tables in a little while. I keep looking, but they've yet to rear their devilish heads, or tails, or whatever they rear.


The elephant in the room is a card that every single dealer said they'd sold at least 50-60 copies: [Corrosive Gale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrosive+Gale). The "color-less", target-less answer to just about every type of flyer around is a sideboard staple here. Just talking to six or seven dealers, my tally is around 400 copies of the card sold so far.


This probably answers the other questions vendors have, "Why aren't people buying [Geist of Saint Traft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft)?" The blue-white monster that was eating up the tables a couple weeks ago has cooled off a bit. That coolness is most certainly influenced by the Phyrexian-mana-fueled Sorcery.


Dave Young over at Comics and Gaming from Gainesville, Virginia showed me an empty box labeled "[Corrosive Gale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrosive+Gale)" and stated, "This holds 80 cards." Young is an affable, talkative sales representative who waxed about the a variety of topics of which selling out of [Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elesh+Norn%2C+Grand+Cenobite) was just the beginning. He talked about wanting reprints of old tokens, the pangs of drafting *Dark Ascension* as your first pack, and one specific topic of which I'd like to share the details with you.


Mr. Young asked strongly (you see, I was wearing my Wizards of the Coast shirt, so people often view me as Mr. Wizard) for a five-color Legendary Goblin. "I have a five-color Goblin Commander deck and no general. I need it." He extolled that it should have a big butt, probably a 2/6, it should be 100% constructed unplayable, have five abilities, and you should only be able to target him by sacrificing a goblin. "Oh, and there has to be dice-rolling involved." This wonderful five-color, dice-rolling, unplayable goblin sounded so amazing to me, I simply had to share it. I told Dave I'd pass it along to a relevant designer, even though I have no such actual capacity, so I thought the best I could do for him was post it here. If you have some good ideas for abilities, hit the forums and sculpt this magical card. Man, it's little tidbits like these that make me love trips to Dealer Alley.


Is Blue-Black really the next big thing? Does is beat more than just Wolf-Run? Will [Geist of Saint Traft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft) rise back into prominence after all these [Corrosive Gale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrosive+Gale)s leave people's sideboards? Will there ever be a five-color Legendary goblin? All these questions will plague me for the rest of the tournament. I've actually been trying to name the goblin for the last twenty minutes, but all I can think of is Ipsky-Bipsky, Emperor of the Goblins. I think other people can do better.




Round 6: Feature Match - Todd Anderson vs. Ali Aintrazi
-------------------------------------------------------


*by Dane Young* 

With one loss apiece, Todd and Ali are going to have some heavy lifting to do if they both want to make day two. One of these two former US National Team members is going to fall into the danger zone of two losses here, meaning they'll have to win out to keep their hopes alive, but the other won't have it easy with three more grueling rounds to play.


### Game 1


Todd zoomed out to [Garruk Relentless](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Relentless) on turn three, but Ali had the [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) to pick it off. He followed up with [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) who ate a [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) but fell to Todd's [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus). [Sorin, Lord of Innistrad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Lord+of+Innistrad) kicked it up a notch for Ali's Esper-colored monstrosity. He made a vampire token, but left the door open for [Garruk, Primal Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Primal+Hunter) to wander in with a 3/3 beast token at his side.

*Todd Anderson*

[Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) was a big time answer, refilling Ali's hand, but allowing [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) to bring in [Kessig Wolf Run](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Wolf+Run) and the [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to turn it on while Garruk kept pumping out beasts. [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) took care of the problem, but [Sorin, Lord of Innistrad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Lord+of+Innistrad) fell to a trampling beast as Todd tapped low to power up his [Kessig Wolf Run](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Wolf+Run).


That gave Ali a window to stick [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) and eat the troublesome [Garruk, Primal Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Primal+Hunter), but he was falling behind to the beast tokens, losing his big Planeswalker to another angry beast. A [Curse of Death's Hold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+Death%27s+Hold) and [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) slowed Todd down a bit, and Todd decided to improve his board rather than jam in damage. He went for [Dungrove Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dungrove+Elder) with [Green Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith), prompting [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment).


Todd was out of gas and was forced to say go after drawing for his turn, groaning in horror when Ali's end of turn [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) spilled [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) and [Sorin, Lord of Innistrad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Lord+of+Innistrad) into the graveyard.


"It's a good one," Ali promised, surprising no one.


He revealed it to be [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil), forcing Todd to lose his last cardâ€”a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)â€”and giving Ali an impressive front line of defense to go with his [Curse of Death's Hold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+Death%27s+Hold). Todd tried to fight back with another [Dungrove Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dungrove+Elder), but [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Liliana%2BVess) ate it and a second [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) wrapped it up.


Ali 1, Todd 0

*Ali Aintrazi*

### Game 2


A third turn [Thrun, the Last Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll) was a brutal kick in the teeth for Ali, who was ready to stop anything else with the two [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s in his hand. He took his beatings like a man, using the [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s to pick off [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) and [Dungrove Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dungrove+Elder) while falling to 8 before [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) arrived.


Not sweating it, Todd shrugged as he found [Bellowing Tanglewurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bellowing+Tanglewurm) with [Green Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) and dropped Ali to 4, but Ali had [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) and [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) to get rid of the big troll and stabilize the board. Todd fired back with [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), but it wasn't good enough against Ali's heavy removal suite.


[Sorin, Lord of Innistrad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Lord+of+Innistrad) joined Ali's team and started making tokens, while Todd was stuck flooding out. Lingering Souls added more damage to Ali's board and a [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) gave Ali the match.


Ali Aintrazi wins the match 2-0




Round 7: Sometimes You Just Have to Get Punched in the Face - David Sharfman (UB Control) vs. Christian Calcano (Humans)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Marc Calderaro* 

It was just announced that we'd be only playing nine rounds today. There was a small collective sigh of relief when the announcement was made, because so many matches were going to time, the day is behind than everyone was hoping. David Sharfman was piloting the almost-ubiquitous, going-to-time UB Control and we'll see how quickly it could dispatch, or be dispatched by the New Yorker Christian Calcano's UW Humans. The match-up is pretty bleak for Sharfman, but if he can hit just the right mix of removal and early counters that allow him to get to his late game, he could sweep the rug out from under Calcano. Both players were sitting at 6-1, and with three rounds to go, a win here makes things a little more comfortable going into Rounds 8 and 9 before the cut for Day 2.


### Game 1


Sharfman's first play was a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) on Calcano's [Grand Abolisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Abolisher). Calcano followed up with an [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) to test the counterspell waters, then finished the turn by sending [Champion of the Parish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion+of+the+Parish) into the surf. Sharfman cast [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) and passed the turn again with nothing on the board but land. The land were sweet â€“ [Ghost Quarter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter) and a [Nephalia Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard) which he used to mill himself before he untapped â€“ but there were still just land; none of which could block or kill creatures.


Sharfman was sitting on a Black Sun's Zenith, [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) and [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) as Calcano spent two turns casting two Hero of the Bladeholds. All of Sharfman's potential energy was matched by Calcano's kinetic energy. Calcano, wary and protective of his two fragile Hero of the Bladeholds meekly questioned, "Attack step?" After Sharfman said go, Calcano snapped, "All right!"


In one fell swoop, he took Sharfman from 18 to 3. The Floridian Pro Tour champ was desperately seeking an out, of which his deck had many, but they just didn't come quickly enough. Double Hero + [Champion of the Parish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion+of+the+Parish) = good beats.


Christian Calcano 1 â€“ 0 David Sharfman



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpbal12/fm7%20Calcano.JPG)
*Christian Calcano*

### Game 2


Calcano started off a bit meanly with a [Doomed Traveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomed+Traveler) and a Thalia, Guardian of Thraben. Luckily, Sharfman was on the play, so the Legend didn't completely cripple him, she just put a lot of weight on his back foot. Sharfman tried to use Black Sun's Zenith to throw the creatures in the waste bin, but Calcano had the [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) ready. The New Yorker followed up with Hero of the Bladehold and took Sharfman to 10. It was 10-20 when Sharfman resolved a Curse of Death's Hold, cleaning up everything but the Hero.


Calcano made a bit of a blunder and left his Hero untapped through his next turn. As Sharfman drew for his turn Calcano said, "Did I really just do that?" He muttered a bit to himself before saying, "Don't worry, I'll get you on the next turn." Sharfman chuckled and used a few [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice)s. After his [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) was [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed, he used another Black Sun's Zenith to clean up the board for good while at 6 life. Calcano was drawing land after land, and was unable to apply any serious pressure to the Floridian after that first wave was taken out. The mistake from Calcano could be relevant, as Sharfman would've had just the right life total if Calcano drew an [Angelic Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Destiny) or an [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) so the Bladehold tokens would survive the -1/-1. However, a glance over at Sharfman's hand revealed all four [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s and a [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) or two. Maybe that mistake wouldn't matter after all.


Sharfman was finally ready to cast a win condition: [Sorin Markov](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov). The planeswalker cast a couple [Vicious Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vicious+Hunger)s swinging the totals to 14-12. [Mirran Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader) (then a second one) valiantly kept Sorin from going ultimate, but the Curse kept their damage manageable. Calcano was trying to claw his way out but another Zenith, clearing the board again, was enough to make him pack it in.


David Sharfman 1 â€“ 1 Christian Calcano


"The only way I beat Humans is when the board looks like that. Look, you have more land than I do."


Calcano had become silent and was looking at the people and happenings around him. He was clearly a little rattled by his silly misplay, but it happens to everyone and the third game is still strongly in his favor.


Sharfman kept in good spirits, even after his unsuccessful game one, but his grin got bigger awaiting game three. As he laid his seven cards face down on the table, he consciously sucked the smile off his face and returned to stoic. He glanced around the room as Calcano shuffled, but made a strong stare once his opponent went down to six cards.

*David Sharfman*

### Game 3


Calcano kept his six and led with a [Champion of the Parish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion+of+the+Parish). He attacked his second turn to bait out the Tragic Slip, and when it didn't come, he followed with an [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure). After untapping, he tried for another [Glorious Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem)-like enchantment, and when it got stopped by [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) he used a [Doomed Traveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomed+Traveler) to pump the Champion and drop Sharfman to 16 .. then 12 ... then 6.


These interim turns are a sad time for UB Control. They just have to sit and get pounded in the face until they stop getting pounded in the face. Sometimes that's because they've successfully stopped the onslaught, and sometimes it's because they're dead.


Throughout these turns, Sharfman was throwing a couple counterspells back and forth, stopping any further development, Calcano's board was already threatening enough. Sharfman took a long time to think on his last turn, but he scooped soon after. He stopped getting punched in the face because he died.


As he was packing up he said, "That's pretty much my nightmare match."


Christian Calcano 2 â€“ 1 David Sharfman




Saturday, 8:15 p.m.: Top Tables, Round 7
----------------------------------------


*by Dane Young* 

The first row of tables can reveal a lot of information to an attentive onlooker, and Grand Prix Baltimore is no different. Coming into the tournament, the diverse Standard format had finally seemed to settle into a rock-paper-scissors of sorts, with [Huntmaster of the Fells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells) Ramp decks suppressing [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) decks enough to allow the slower blue control decks to take root, with a good mix of other decks like Frites, Humans and Zombies on the fringes of the metagame.


After letting the dust settle a bit, we checked on the top 12 tables in round seven to find a good sample of what was doing well through the middle of the first day. The results were just about what we expected, with a good amount of RG Ramp, [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), Esper and U/B Control, with a smattering of other not quite rogue decks. Here, take a look:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Archetype | Count |
| RG Ramp | 5 |
| UW Delver | 4 |
| Esper Control | 3 |
| UB Control | 3 |
| Zombies | 2 |
| Frites | 2 |
| 5-Color Control | 1 |
| Monored | 1 |
| Grixis Control | 1 |
| Monowhite Tokens | 1 |
| Spirit Delver | 1 |
|  |

Considering BrianKibler's recent Pro Tour win with RG Ramp, it should come as no surprise that it leads our pack in popularity, but the rise of control is something to consider with Charles Gindy and Patrick Chapin comprising two-thirds of the UB Control population. Those decks seem primed to do well given the slower field, but they'll have to fight through a horde of strong players armed with good decks if they want to make a deep run. Stay tuned to our coverage to find out what comes out on top!




Saturday, 9:24 p.m: - Brian Kibler â€“ He's Pretty Good
-----------------------------------------------------


*by Marc Calderaro* 

With some wandering time, I sat and watched Brian Kibler play a match. He's throwing around GR Aggro, the deck he was going to play at Pro Tour *Dark Ascension* before a last-minute audible. Though that audible gave him the win, he still wanted to play an aggressive deck filled with [Strangleroot Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangleroot+Geist)s, [Huntmaster of the Fells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells) and the like, and so here that deck is.


Kibler went to three games against the UB Zombies deck (which I am trying to christen "[Drowned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowned)"â€“ feel free to proliferate) but won fairly convincingly at the end. After his opponent lost, he immediately asked Kibler for advice. He asked about any misplays or how he might've been able to change the match. Kibler thought earnestly and answered with a few specific things and then broadened his answer to talk about the match as a whole. This level of interaction is pretty much what I think of when I think of Brian Kibler. He's a **Magic** superstar, sure; he's locked for Platinum Pro Level and for the World **Magic** Cup, but he's so community-minded and always up for a gab.


After his match finished up, and his conversation finished. I picked his brain for a bit about the field, his competition, his stream, and his upcoming chance to becoming America's team captain.


Firstly, about his deck, he doesn't fully endorse it. "It's OK against the field, but it rolls to Wolf Run; and Wolf Run just won a Pro Tour, you know." Hmm, if only I could remember what event he's referring to... Additionally, he seemed even more interested about his [Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright) deck that he really wants to unleash upon the world. He said [Nihil Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb) made him a bit too scared, but that doesn't mean you won't see it in the near future. "I think I'm going to Salt Lake City solely to be able to play that deck in a tournament." Must be nice.


Though he doesn't think RG Aggro is the answer to the format, he said Wolf Run is the only truly bad match-up and you put enough pressure on Frites that they have to react, and your flurry of powerful creatures can knock them off-balance. Also, to give his that little extra push in the aggro matchup which is already favorable, he has a couple [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull)s floating around (which was what allowed him to race the multiple Geralf's Messengers in the last round). It's nice to know that when you accomplish as much as he has, you can bring these sort of pet decks to Grand Prixes and still do so well with them.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpbal12/interviewKibler.JPG)
*Brian Kibler*

But though Kibler has accomplished so much, there is at least one thing he hasn't done. I'd heard at Worlds this past year that Kibler said one of his biggest **Magic** regrets was not being able to hoist up the American flag at Worlds having won a Nationals. He told me though that's a bit of an exaggeration, he always wanted to win a Nationals event, especially because he's made the Quarterfinals twice. Though he might not be able to lift the flag by winning a traditional Nationals again, he's in the lead to be the captain of Team America at the first ever World **Magic** Cup by a fair amount of points. Ahead of the second-place Luis Scott-Vargas by a full eight, though it's possible for him to be dethroned, it'll require some good Pro Tour finishes from his opponents and some bad ones from him.


"And Luis isn't even here this weekend," Kibler added. We discussed that though neither Luis nor Brian will be going to all the remaining Grand Prixes, a nice finish here could give Kibler a firm cushion to sit upon as he cruises into Seattle, Indianapolis, Salt Lake City and then into the World **Magic** Cup in May.


Filling the rest of his time outside of work, travel and **Magic** Pro Tours and Grand Prixes, are pretty much filled with, you guessed it, more **Magic**. Like many of the pro players have been realizing, online streaming is the future. (Probably taking a sweet cue from Rashad Miller's awesome GGsLive in the newly revamped video coverage). Lately Kibler has been streaming as much as possible. Generally he's just playing **Magic** Online, but as we talked about, that's all streaming has to be. Kibler said that unlike everything that came before it, streaming allows you access to tournament-level pro magic in between tournaments. And even better than that, there's an interactivity that was simply impossible before.


"I always have the chat window open on my second monitor, and people can immediately question why I did what I did." This level of instantaneous interactivity makes it easy to communicate with your favorite **Magic** Pro. And honestly, with a heartthrob like little Kibbles, who wouldn't want that instantaneous interactivity, Amirite? Providing even more evidence to that statement (as if Kibler's coif wasn't enough), as Kibler and I talked about his stream, four or five people standing around all chimed in about how good and informative of a stream it was and how much they enjoyed watching. Kibler graciously thanked them and started up little dialogues with them on the spot about the tournament. I imagine this is exactly what his stream sessions are like.


The latest Pro Tour champion, Brian Kibler is such a good ambassador for this game. He's affable, vibrant and, well, and he's really good. I think he's a great candidate to hoist the American flag into the sky at the inaugural World **Magic** Cup this year. And if things keeps going like they have, it's the most likely outcome.


If you can't get enough Pro **Magic**, check out his stream at <http://www.twitch.tv/bmkibler> and just say hey.




Round 8: Feature Match - Gregory Reelitz vs. Charles Gindy
----------------------------------------------------------


*by Dane Young* 

Round 8 Feature Match: Gregory Reelitz vs. Charles Gindy


Gregory Reelitz was on quite a run coming into this round, crushing a grinder yesterday and settling in for the second-to-last round on the day at 7-0. Let's see, five plus seven minus three is makes that nine straight non-bye wins for Greg. His opponent, with Pro Tour Hollywood champion among other titles, Charles Gindy, was having a decent day of his own as he looked to add to his resume.


A pair of accelerators and were swept away by Gindy's [Black Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) as the pro looked to slow things down. Greg reloaded with multiple [Tracker's Instincts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tracker%27s+Instincts) and [Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch)es, but was light on gas and Gindy's [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) for his [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) wasn't helping matters.


[Thrun, the Last Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll) gave Greg a way to put some pressure on, forcing Gindy to take time off from his frenzy of card drawing with [Black Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith). Greg got right back to work with more graveyard fillers, but he was running out of time to get Gindy dead before [Nephalia Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard) filled his yard a little too much.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpbal12/fm8%20Charles%20Gindy.JPG)
*Charles Gindy*

Craftily massaging his life total with [Curse of Death's Hold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+Death%27s+Hold)s, [Black Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith)s and [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) blocks, Gindy ducked and dodged his way down to two life, but it looked like he was going to be a turn short of milling his opponent out in the face of two [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) tokens. He looked shocked when Greg tapped two for [Tracker's Instincts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tracker%27s+Instincts), giving him the extra mill he needed to finish off Greg's library with two [Nephalia Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard) activations.


Gindy 1, Reelitz 0


### Game 2


Greg started with [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and [Tracker's Instincts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tracker%27s+Instincts), but [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip) cut off the accelerator as Gindy worked his deck with [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice). A replacement [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) arrived and Greg flashed back [Memory's Journey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory%27s+Journey) after Gindy fired another [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice), choosing to leave the [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip). Gindy took advantage of it with [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) to keep Greg for getting too far ahead on mana.


[Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) slipped through the cracks, however, and Gindy quickly found himself at 8. [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) joined the party, and Gindy looked to be in a world of hurt. He found [Phantasmal Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) to copy [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) and dared Greg to attack.

*Greg Reelitz*

He did, killing the [Phantasmal Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) with a poke from [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) and using the rest to [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) Gindy's face. The clone turned into lifelink and deathtouch 3/3s, the latter of which traded with [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) after [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip) picked off papa [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) to save Gindy some damage. The lifelink tokens traded and [Black Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) took care of the last token, but Greg went right back to work firing off [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) after [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites).


A pair of [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)s kept Gindy from getting up-close and personal with another big monster, and [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) let him keep the trouble at bay a while longer, eating Greg's only white source in [Razorverge Thicket](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorverge+Thicket) and stretching Gindy's 9 life out a little further.


[Thrun, the Last Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll) showed up late as Gindy had already earned 11 loyalty from [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated), but Greg set the two mythics dueling while he desperately looked for a way through the rest of Gindy's life total. He found one in [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan), but [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Karn%2BLiberated) and a fresh [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) put an end to both threats, and Gindy was able to grind the rest of Greg's library down to dust by dual-wielding [Nephalia Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard)s.


Charles Gindy wins the match 2-0




Round 9: Feature Match - Orrin Beasley (UB Control) vs. Drew Levin (Spirit Delver)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Marc Calderaro* 

Both of these Grade-A grinders are sitting at 6-0-1 in a win-and-in situation. Orrin Beasley made it to the finals of Grand Prix Dallas and has been a consistent top-tabler. Drew Levin has finished in the Top 8 of a bevy of StarCityGames Open Series and is a writer for the site. Though many times he can be seen commanding [Stifle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle)s he does just as well with the newer card frames. As we continue our Tour de UB Control, we will now see what happens when the big behemoth meets up against the Spirit Delver deck that proved so affectively oh-so-shortly ago. This match is often defined by subtle jockeys for position as the Spirit deck looks to eke out damage over and over while fighting off Big Control's removal with some well-placed counterspells.


### Game 1


Levin won the die roll and opened with a [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets). It made a [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip) into the graveyard (prompted by Beasley) and Levin spent the next couple turns casting some [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s. He had a [Drogskol Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drogskol+Captain) and two [Vapor Snag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag)s. When he found a [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls), he cast it, then followed with the Captain, attempting to create tenacious fliers. Beasley stemmed the bleeding by killing a 1/1 Spirit right before it gained Hexproof. Then after sinking to 14, he used [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) to find some more gas.


Beasley took a big turn during Levin's next combat step with a [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), into two more [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip)s, both targeting the [Drogskol Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drogskol+Captain). Sadly for Beasley, the second Slip was countered and the rest of the attack resolved, making the totals 7-20 in Levin's favor.

Though Beasley went further to 4, he resolved two Curse of Death's Holds and the match-up quickly devolved into, "Go." "Go." "Go." "Go." Ad infinitum. A [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) from Levin, an Alchemy from Beasley. "Go." "Go". "Go." "Go." The [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) had be previously hit with a [Vapor Snag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag), and all these statements of "Go" were accompanied with the underlying life total of 3-20. I stopped to take a look at both players' hands, as they'd resorted to discarding every turn, and they looked exactly as you'd expect: Levin had barely usable [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)s and a couple counterspells while Beasley had almost all counters with a board sweeper and spot removal for good measure.


Levin cast a [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), looked at Beasley's hand, looked through his graveyard, looked at [Nephalia Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard) on Beasley's board, and scooped up his cards. He was not going to fight through all that in time.


Orrin Beasley 1 â€“ 0 Drew Levin


### Game 2


When Levin cast a turn one [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), he saw [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip), [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip), [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) and land for his opponent. "It's slippery out there," Beasley prodded.


Levin spent the next few turns just sculpting his hand, a [Drogskol Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drogskol+Captain) and two [Phantasmal Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image)s waiting in his hand. When he cast another [Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Probe), Beasley proclaimed, "It's getting more slippery." It was the same hand as before just plus another [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip) and a Black Sun's Zenith.

Levin's [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) sub-game continued. He was trying to cast as many [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s as he could. Even though he ran out of the actual card, that's what [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) was for. Beasley made the mage slip into an open grave and the board was now empty again, save a [Nihil Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb) for Beasley. [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge), [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and a second Captain was the correct combination of cards to get Levin to cast that first [Drogskol Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drogskol+Captain). He left exactly three mana up. Beasley let him keep it and now Levin thought some more. Next turn he laid a [Phantasmal Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) backed up with a [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) and [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) on the Captain was eaten by [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) and the [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) re-ate it on the Flashback thanks to Beasley's [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). Some points of damage were thrown back and forth, now 17-14 for Beasley, but the Black Sun's Zenith simply reset it all. And Levin was back to [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ing.


Levin got another Captain out, but Beasley fired back with [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) with [Dissipate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) back-up. Levin didn't mind. He simply made two more copies of the Captain and made it 13-14. Beasley [Lifelink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifelink)ed the totals to 17-10, then, realizing he couldn't race well, used another Black Sun's Zenith (or maybe it was the same one â€“ who knows with those Zeniths).


Then Levin said it was time. He cast [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), flashbacked a [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) which didn't stick and slammed down the [Hero of Bladehold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold). Beasley thought a fair amount, then magically used two [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip)s after his draw step to clear the board and refueled [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) with another Germ token. The next [Snap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)caster from Levin was the final straw for the Spellbomb and after a [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge) to remove the Germ, Levin was handless and Beasley was defenseless.


[Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) (netting a [Dissipate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) to counter Levin's top-decked [Hero of Bladehold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold)) and a second refueling of [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) was too much for Levin to handle. He had two draw steps and neither of them saved him.


Orrin Beasley 2 â€“ 0 Drew Levin
