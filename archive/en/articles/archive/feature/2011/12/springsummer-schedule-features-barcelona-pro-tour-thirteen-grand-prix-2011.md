Four continents and ten different countries highlight the premier play schedule for April through August of 2012, featuring the second Pro Tour of the season and thirteen Grand Prix.

The Pro Tour returns to Barcelona for the first time since 2001, when the trophy went to the legendary Kai Budde. Barcelona's Pro Tour featuring the third set in the *Innistrad* block will be held May 11-13, 2012, and the format will be *Innistrad* Block Constructed / Booster Draft with a Block Constructed Top 8. The Modern-format Pro Tour Qualifier season for Barcelona begins in late December with in-person and **Magic Online** events.

The second Pro Tour of the year will continue the expanded live coverage of Pro Tours that will kick off at Pro Tour *Dark Ascension* in February. Last month's Worlds coverage showcased the increased access to real-time information via the CoverItLive chat platform. That immediate access to information will grow next year as we expand the live webcast to cover all three days of Pro Tour action. The video stream will feature live match coverage, behind-the-scenes interviews with **Magic** R&D members, deck techs with your favorite players, draft analysis, and much more.

Moving over to the Grand Prix schedule, this section of the year features five events in the United States, three in Europe, and visits to Canada, the Philippines, Japan, Brazil, and China. A full schedule can be seen at the bottom of this page. Formats will be announced in the coming months, so be sure to keep an eye on the Grand Prix information page. Each Grand Prix in 2012 will have a prize payout of $30,000.

As one of the first changes to the 2012 premier play invitation system based on player feedback that we will be announcing over the coming weeks, Grand Prix winners will be awarded an invitation to the next Pro Tour. This change will take effect at Grand Prix Austin in January and correspond with the current Planeswalker Points Competitive Season. Winners of Grand Prix in January through March will earn invitations to the Pro Tour to be held in Barcelona, and winners of Grand Prix from April through August will be invited to the third Pro Tour of the year.

Start your Grand Prix prep by finding a Grand Prix Trial at a Wizards Play Network location near you. Look for Trials for the spring/summer Grand Prix to start by March and get a leg up on your competition with a three-round bye.

Dates and specific locations for the rest of the 2012 Grand Prix schedule will be announced between now and Pro Tour *Dark Ascension* in February, but we can say that the end-of-the-year slate will include six events in North America, four in Europe, three in the Asia/Pacific region, and one in either Central or South America.
