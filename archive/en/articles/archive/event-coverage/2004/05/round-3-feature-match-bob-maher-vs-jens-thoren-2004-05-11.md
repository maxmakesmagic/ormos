Jens was last year's big winner at this very event, and his signature card--[Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum)--has been doing good work as a chump blocker in the days since. His opponent, Bob Maher, has won a Grand Prix, a Pro Tour, and Worlds, and is looking to immortalize his pleasant mug on his own card with a win here. Bob's deck is comprised of Invasion and Seventh Edition exclusively, and is a decent red-green beatdown deck, even if it has a few junky cards. Thoren chose his packs with an eye towards black, but the packs didn't out for him; the best rare he has is [Decree of Savagery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Savagery). Blech.


### Game 1


Neither player drew great hands--Jens had two land (allowing him to play only two cards), and Bob had three [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s. Maher played a [Thornscape Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Apprentice) on turn 1, and Jens answered with [Stonewood Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonewood+Invoker).


Bob killed the Invoker with [Assault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault), and swung for 1. Jens had no play on his turn, so Bob played a third land and sat back with [Turf Wound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turf+Wound), ready to add insult to injury. Bob Wounded him, and of course Jens drew a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) that turn, but had to remain stuck on 2 land.


With such a huge land advantage, Bob started in with the beats: [Rooting Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rooting+Kavu), [Kavu Aggressor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Aggressor), and [Halam Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halam+Djinn). Jens was never able to get another creature down, and scooped up his cards when the Djinn hit the stack.


Maher 1 - Thoren 0


Again Thoren kept a two-lander, and again Maher kept a bunch of [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s. This time it was Bob that suffered, as Jens was able to put out two creatures even though he didn't draw a third land until Bob had [Creeping Mold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold)ed one of the first two. Bob drew neither green creatures nor [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s, whereas Jens drew enough lands to keep a steady stream of guys pouring out.


Bob's [Elite Archers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Archers) slowed the beats, but with no other plays, he succumbed to Jens's horde.


So far, he who can play his spells, wins.


Maher 1 - Thoren 1


Both players had reasonable draws in the third game, but Bob's going first ended up being huge. He played [Turf Wound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turf+Wound) on turn three, then [Rooting Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rooting+Kavu), then [Creeping Mold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold) on Thoren's only [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). Jens couldn't cast his spells, and Bob played bomb after bomb: [Elite Archers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Archers), [Benalish Trapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Trapper), and [Halam Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halam+Djinn). Jens simply couldn't keep up.


Maher 2 - Jens 1


Bob was later seen showing the replay of the [Turf Wound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turf+Wound)/[Creeping Mold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold) game to his giddy pals. It certainly feels good when your 23rd card wins the game. Maher ended up 3-0 in the pack draft format with sets (Invasion and Seventh Edition) that other players stayed away from.
