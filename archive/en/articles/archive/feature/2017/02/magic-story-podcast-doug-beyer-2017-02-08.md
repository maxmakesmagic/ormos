Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The *Magic* Story Podcast might be the piece of content most requested to me from fans on Twitter.


People who love our story, our worlds, our characters, and our art are some of our more passionate fans. Their care for and dedication to the creative aspects of the game are impressive.


And I would say the same about our dedicated creative staff. There might not be any department that I enjoy speaking with more, as they always speak with passion about worlds they create out of thin air, about characters they breathe life into, and about art that makes visual some of the most fantastic concepts in gaming.


So we decided to bring some of those discussions to you, the fans, in this series of podcasts that goes behind the scenes with the people who create the worlds and characters of *Magic: The Gathering*. Each episode will be a conversation with one person on the team covering one of the many topics they're most passionate about.


Today we're talking to Senior Game Designer Doug Beyer about the most requested topic for this show: the creative process. We'll talk about where stories start, how concepts become characters, where the creative and the cardset teams interact, and how a final story ends up on your screen.
