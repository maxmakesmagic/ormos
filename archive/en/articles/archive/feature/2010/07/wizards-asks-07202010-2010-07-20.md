![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_zachill.jpg)**Zac Hill:** Archenemy! I like going into a game knowing whom I need to beat up. Having *worked* in politics for the better part of five years, the last thing I want to do when I'm having fun is haggle over interpersonal power dynamics and juggle even *more* politics. Archenemy gets rid of that step and just says, "Hey you over thereâ€”kill those guys!" Plus, the moment of flipping a scheme card is one of the most fun, high-variance moments in **Magic**.
