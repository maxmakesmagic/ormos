Marco Cammilluzzi was disqualified in Round 8 during an investigation. The head judge has provided the following statement:


During Round 8, a floor judge became involved in Marco Cammilluzzi’s match because of a game play error. During the investigation, Cammilluzzi’s explanations led me to believe that he could be providing misleading statements about how he thought a card worked, and how he had played it during this event. After gathering information from previous rounds’ opponents, I concluded that this was indeed the case. The rules state that lying to a tournament official is an infraction that requires a disqualification.
