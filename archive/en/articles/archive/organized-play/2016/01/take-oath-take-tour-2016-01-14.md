Regular readers may have noticed that Organized Play is a day early. Thursdays will be the new day for Organized Play, so check back on Thursdays for the latest updates and highlights from in-store programs as well as our premier offerings!


*Oath of the Gatewatch* is nearly upon us, and you'll get your first chance to crack into some brand-new cards this weekend at a Prerelease near you.


And, following Prerelease weekend, the next round of Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers will get underway with the new cards legal for tournament play.


First up...


Prereleases!
============


*Oath of the Gatewatch* Prereleases take place this weekend worldwide. Check with your local store to get full details on things like price, capacity, and more. Don't know where to find a store in your area? Use our [Store Locator](http://locator.wizards.com/) to find one near you!


If you've never been to a Prerelease before, or if you're just looking for a refresher on what to expect, or if you want the low-down on *this* set's Prerelease, [Gavin Verhey wrote an excellent Prerelease Primer](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/how-play-limited/oath-gatewatch-prerelease-primer-2016-01-12) on Tuesday, so check that out! It also comes with some videos—courtesy of Matt Tabak and Garth Avery—that explain what to look out for in terms of mechanics in *Oath of the Gatewatch*.


Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers for Pro Tour Sydney
===================================================


Starting next weekend, the qualifying round of Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers for the Pro Tour in Sydney (taking place August 5–7 this year) kick off! Players who win a Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier from January 23 until April 17 will earn their invitation to compete in *one* Regional Pro Tour Qualifier for the Pro Tour in Sydney between May 28 and June 5.


The latest Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier event information can be found on the [PPTQs for Pro Tour Sydney Fact Sheet](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/pptqsyd16). To find a Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier near you, use our [Store Locator](http://locator.wizards.com/) or take a look at our [list of currently scheduled PPTQs](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/pptqsyd16/locations).


Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers for Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*
==================================================================


And for those of you who won a Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier in the most recently completed round (which ran from August 22 through November 22, 2015), your Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers are coming up!


Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers for [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi) take place on either February 21 or February 28. The format for these RPTQs is Standard Constructed, so bring your best Standard deck to battle for your shot for the Pro Tour!


The Top 4 players from each Regional Pro Tour Qualifier with 128 or fewer players gets an invitation and a travel award to Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*, which takes place April 22–24 in Madrid, Spain. In the event that a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier is over 128 players in size, then the Top 8 players will instead be given invitations and airfare to compete in Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*.


There are pluses for playing in a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier as well. All players who compete in a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier will receive a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) promo card as well as an event-exclusive deck box featuring artwork from [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar).

Not able to make it to a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier in person? There's still an option for you! *Magic Online* will be featuring two Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers on February 20 (at 3 p.m. PT) and February 27 (at 5 a.m. PT).

Between this, the upcoming Grand Prix, and [Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/ogw), it's a great time to grab some allies and dive into the brand-new cards. For those of you attending your local Prerelease, may your pools be robust and your *Expeditions* be frequent. For those of you competing in any of our events as you take your first step toward the Pro Tour, best of luck. We hope to see you on the big stage someday!
