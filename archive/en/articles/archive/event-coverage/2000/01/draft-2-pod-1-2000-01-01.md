### Set 1


**Booster 1**


Ladislav: Aven Fisher  

Oliver: Rabid Elephant  

Holger: Aven Archer  

Martin: Springing Tiger  

Nicolai: Chainflinger  

Jakub: Fledgeling Imp  

Stephan: Psionic Gift  

Matthias: Morgue Theft


Once again all of these players ended up playing each of their first pick colours in this draft. There was a little bit more chaos later on though, as Jakub and Nicolai started exploring each others colours - both ending up with white decks with the Norwegian splashing a fourth.


**Booster 2**


Oliver: Stone-Tongue Basilisk??  

Holger: Hallowed Healer  

Martin: Elephant Ambush  

Nicolai: Cephalid Scout  

Jakub: Aven Cloudchaser  

Stephan: Leaf Dancer  

Matthias: Patchwork Gnomes  

Ladislav: Blazing Salvo  

Ladislav2: Halberdier  

Matthias2: Caustic Tar


I am not sure I agree with Oliver's pick here. I think he got 'lured' in by the fatty where the Elephants are probably the more efficient creatures.


**Booster 3**


Holger: Mystic Zealot  

Martin: Overrun  

Nicolai: Mystic Visionary  

Jakub: Morbid Hunger  

Stephan: Wild Mongrel  

Matthias: Patriach's Desire  

Ladislav: Millikin


**Booster 4**


Martin: Metamorphic Wurm??  

Nicolai: Mystic Zealot  

Jakub: Patriach's Desire  

Stephan: Wild Mongrel  

Matthias: Crypt Creeper  

Ladislav: Thermal Blast  

Oliver: Krosan Archer  

Holger: Pilgrim of Virtue  

Holger2: Standstill  

Oliver2: Centaur Garden  

Ladislav2: Pardic Firecat  

Matthias2: Psionic Gift


Again a questionable green card pick here, with many of the top Pros preferring the Wild Mongrel in this position.


**Booster 5**


Nicolai: Cephalid Scout  

Jakub: Whispering Shade  

Stephan: Roar of the Wurm  

Matthias: Psychatog  

Ladislav: Blazing Salvo  

Oliver: Elephant Ambush  

Holger: Scrivener


**Booster 6**


Jakub: Ghastly Demise  

Stephan: Puppeteer  

Matthias: Dirty Wererat  

Ladislav: Dreamwalker  

Oliver: Werebear  

Holger: Aven Flock  

Martin: Vivify  

Nicolai: Volcanic Spray


**Booster 7**


Stephan: Repel  

Matthias: Dusk Imp  

Ladislav: Escape Artist  

Oliver: Diligent Farnhand  

Holger: Mystic Crusader  

Martin: Face of Fear??  

Nicolai: Second Thoughts  

Jakub: Morbid Hunger  

Jakub2: Patrol Hound


I imagine the green mage took the Face if Fear over the Morbid Hunger because he was intending to splash that colour, but is it a good enough card to splash?


Nicolai was quite dissapointed when Jakub took the Patrol Hound, but Slemr had only one colour and had to move into a second at this stage.


**Booster 8**


Matthias: Flame Burst  

Ladislav: Aven Smokechaser  

Oliver: Squirrel Nest  

Holger: Aven Fisher  

Martin: Skyshooter  

Nicolai: Seafloor Debris  

Jakub: Krosan Avenger  

Stephan: Refresh


Again Jakub moved into a neighbour's colours here, but in the end he dropped the idea of being a green mage.


These are the colours the players ended up playing in their decks:

Nicolai also splashed for a Mystic Enforcer.


As with the last draft I covered there were alternate blue mages round the table, but surprisingly only three green players. Of note there were three red players in a row.


### Set 2


**Booster 1**


Matt: Filthy Cur  

Steph: Repel  

Jakub: Metamorphic Wurm  

Nico: Aether Burst  

Martin: Leaf Dancer  

Holger: Divine Sacrament  

Oliver: Skyshooter  

Ladi: Psionic Gift


Oliver also picked up a Farmhand.


**Booster 2**


Steph: Nantuku Disciple  

Jakub: Childhood Horror  

Nico: Firebolt  

Martin: Skeletal Scrying  

Holger: Cephalid Scout  

Oliver: Cartographer  

Ladi: Pardic Fireat


**Booster 3**


Jakub: Ghastly Demise  

Nico: Balshan Griffin  

Martin: Krosan Archer  

Holger: Aven Flock  

Oliver: Refresh  

Ladi: Scriviner  

Matt: Fledgeling Imp


Matthias also picked up a Dwarven Strike Force.


**Booster 4**


Nico: Flame Burst  

Martin: Call of the Herd  

Holger: Second Thoughts  

Oliver: Blazing Salvo  

Ladi: Dematerialise  

Matt: Gravedigger


Stephan did not really have a pick from this booster, but Jakub managed to wheel an Afflict and an Aven Cloudchaser, whilst Matthias wheeled a Diabolic Tutor.


So, at the half way point of the draft Jakub in particular was feeling a little unsure about what colours he would end up playing and it seemed like Matthias was having a little trouble too - eventually being forced into black/red.


Other interesting picks and power-cards:


Ladislav Zupancic had been drafting a red/blue deck all the way through this draft, but he made a few challenging decisions. Firstly he took a Cephalid Scout over a Broker, then he took Firebolt over Persuasion . . . go figure.


Nicolai took a third Cephalid Scout over a Syncopate. He later explained to me that his deck had way too few creatures.


Holger Meinecke went on to draft not one but two Wayward Angels!


Nicolai took a Mystic Enforcer off Jakub, but splashed to play it.


Jakub himself had a Repentant Vampire, whilst Stephan Meyer managed to pick up an Overrun.
