Welcome to our weekly look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. With no Premier events happening last weekend, our Top 25 remains constant. At the top of the table, Eric Froehlich maintains his slender lead over reigning World Champion Seth Manfield. Somewhat lost in the shuffle of Manfield's superb run to victory in Seattle—he dominated the Swiss rounds with a near-flawless 13-1 record, before two hard-fought victories on Sunday brought him the title—is the fact that, in winning the title, he became the first American to be crowned World Champion since 2000. That's an astonishing fifteen years, dating back to Jon Finkel's win in Brussels. Manfield is in pretty exalted company.


Reigning Player of the Year Mike Sigrist sits in third place, ahead of Paul Rietzl at No. 4. Sam Black and Owen Turtenwald, both of whom reached the final four of the World Championship in Seattle, round out the top half-dozen. The next six, meanwhile, are a truly global mix. Jacob Wilson (No. 7) and Shaun McLaren (No. 12) represent Canada. The Asia Pacific representation comes from Hong Kong's Lee Shi Tian (No. 9) and two-time Player of the Year Yuuya Watanabe (No. 11). Ondřej Stráský at No. 10 is the sole European player in the top dozen right now, while Brad Nelson ensures that the powerful US presence is felt throughout the rankings.


Next week, we'll see many of the Pros in action, but mostly not against one another. It's *Battle for Zendikar* Prerelease weekend, and that means millions of packs being cracked around the world as we finally get our hands on the latest *Magic* expansion. Join us next week for more from the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
