 **Q: Do the creative and design teams at Wizards have any inclination of ever revisiting Ulgrotha? —Julian P.**  


**A: Mike McArtor, copyeditor for DailyMTG**


Mark Rosewater gets asked about [returning to various planes](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/39689685792/youve-talked-before-about-r-ds-desire-to-keep) fairly frequently on [his blog](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/), which he usually [answers with a question](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/54323960548/any-hints-on-which-plane-will-be-featured-in-the-next). Ulgrotha [has come up](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/10850270457/was-there-consideration-given-to-the-idea-of-returning) [more than once](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/24297165908/re-a-return-to-ulgrotha-i-grant-homelands-was-a-very).


This question allows a nice segue into 20th Anniversary Week festivities because Mark starts off the last link with, "We have a lot of [awesome planes](http://www.wizards.com/magic/multiverse/planes.aspx)..." I bring this up also because on [the flavor side](http://staging.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?tag=savortheflavor&description=taste%20the%20magic), there are [a ton of great stories](http://staging.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?tag=uncharted%20realms&description=uncharted%20realms) in **Magic**'s twenty years of history. If you're interested in the flavorful aspects of the game, past and present, you might want to check out [Doug Beyer's blog](http://dougbeyermtg.tumblr.com/) as well!
