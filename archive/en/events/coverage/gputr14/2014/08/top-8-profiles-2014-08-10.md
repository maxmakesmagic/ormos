### Susanne Bornelöv


**Age:** 29  
**Occupation:** PhD Student  
**Hometown:** Uppsala, Sweden  
  

**Previous Magic accomplishments:** 
  
18th place at GP Moscow 2014, Top 64 at two Grand Prix.
 



**What deck did you play and why did you choose it? Did last weekend's Pro Tour *Magic 2015* influence your decision?** 
  
Black-Green Devotion. It is a good deck and all match-ups are equally bad. The sideboard was built to fight the decks that I expected after the Pro Tour (I was assuming a lot of players would try their luck with aggressive decks).
 



**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**
  
No changes.

### Eliott Boussaud


**Age:** 25  
**Occupation:** Teacher and Traveler  
**Hometown:** Toulouse, France  
  

**Previous Magic accomplishments:** 
  
Top 8 at Grand Prix Prague 2013
 



**What deck did you play and why did you choose it? Did last weekend's Pro Tour *Magic 2015* influence your decision?** 
  
Mono-Blue Devotion with four [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere)s that I splashed - the card is simply too strong. The Pro Tour helped me and my mates to prepare a perfect sideboard for the expected metagame.
 



**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**
  
Hard to say. I would probably cut a [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) for a [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay). Four [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)s are a lot.

Yes, the Pro Tour was an important influence.
 



**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**
  
I would not change my current deck.

Not much, as long as I play against Black-White …

None.
