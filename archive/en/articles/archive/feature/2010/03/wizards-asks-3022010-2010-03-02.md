*Do some rares or mythic rares seem to follow you around?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** I think this has happened to everybody, hasn't it? Sometimes it feels lucky, other times unlucky, but if you open a lot of boosters, odds are you'll notice some weird patterns in the rares. That's why they call it random!

In *Lorwyn* it was [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren). In *Shards of Alara* it was [Mirror of Fate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+of+Fate) and [Tezzeret the Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret+the+Seeker). In *Zendikar*, I couldn't stop opening [Archive Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archive+Trap)s, but I have barely any [Hellkite Charger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellkite+Charger)s. In *Worldwake*, I seem to have a bizarre affinity for [Bazaar Trader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+Trader)sâ€”I already have four, and I've opened maybe a box. And on the mythic rare front, so far [Novablast Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Novablast+Wurm) and [Eye of Ugin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin) are tied at two each. I've been rooting for [Novablast Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Novablast+Wurm), which is my kind of fatty, but after [yesterday's Arcana](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/396) I'm not so sure .....
