The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 20, 2017. Today's Update is brought to by 2/2 hand creatures.


Today's Must
============


1. [Which Energy Deck Should I Play?](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/category/detail/219) | Hareruya English | Pierre Dagen

Even amid all the *Unstable* excitement, premier play is still somehow going on. With various energy archetypes still dominating the Standard metagame (including at Grand Prix Portland over the weekend—congrats to Shahar Shenhar!), that headline isn't nearly as hyperbolic as it sounds. Pierre looks at the strengths and weaknesses of all the common permutations and offers advice on how to select for a given metagame.


Today's Previews
================


Preview season continues, and even more *Unstable* cards are showing up around the internet today! You still want to see them, right?

Presenting . . . Hot Fix! I eagerly await the chance to cast this, get excited about my perfect plan, get psyched out by the time pressure, drop my whole library, possibly hit my head on a table, and have nothing to show for my shame. It'll be fun to watch more coordinated people use this for actual gain, too.

"*Unglued* came out in 1998. I was negative eight back then." Wait, you need *more* reasons than just that perfectly adorable line to watch the video? Uh, he has a squirrel puppet. It talks in a creepy voice. There are funny outtakes at the end. Oh, right, and there's an *Unstable* preview card in there that invites the commandeering of other people's hands.

As helpfully pointed out in the title, this video is not in English. The preview card inside is, though!

X, the super-secret spy from the Agents of S.N.E.A.K., laid out a [series of puzzles](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-preview/magic-puzzling-unstable-edition-2017-11-20) to be solved before he could divulge his super-secret information. Now that the truth is known, Mark Rosewater (also an agent of S.N.E.A.K., apparently) has been cleared to reveal this preview card!


Previews to Watch For
=====================


I'm writing this while it's still dark out, so a number of today's previews are still unpublished. Check back as the day goes on to catch even more *Unstable* goodies!


1. [@Card\_Kingdom](https://twitter.com/card_kingdom?lang=en)

Card Kingdom will be dropping not one, but *two* previews at some point today. All I can say for sure is that they are completely normal *Magic* cards that definitely make sense.


1. [@Wizards\_Magic](https://twitter.com/@wizards_magic)

On Friday, you fine people selfied (is that a verb? I'm going with it) your way to a preview of Proper Laboratory Attire from *Unstable*. Keep an eye on Twitter today for a chance to earn extra previews!


1. [The Mana Source](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheManaSource/featured)

At some point today, Wedge will unveil another preview card. I don't know exactly when. He's the mastermind behind this complex evil plot. I'm just the messenger.

From great cosplay to top-notch competition to a seven-year-old going 5-4, Grand Prix Portland had it all. Congratulations to Shahar Shenhar, who won the whole deal!
