Grand Prix Washington D.C. 2010
-------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpwas10/BradNelsonCloseBlurb.jpg)Grand Prix Washington D.C. has come to a close. A staggering 1931 players annihilated all previous North American records, with a vibrant Standard environment bringing players from across the United States and beyond. The international flavor was enhanced with many of the finest players in the world descending on Dulles, spending a weekend of Grand Prix get-togethers before the showpiece in San Juan, the second Pro Tour of the season, next weekend. An excellent Top 8 showcased some fine US talent, and only Carlos Romao, the 2002 World Champion, stood against the might of the States.


The Final saw Owen Turtenwald face Brad Nelson in a classic matchup. Turtenwald would be the aggressor with the perennial powerhouse Jund, while Nelson would look to survive the onslaught, Spread some Seas, Spring some Minds, and Slay some Banes. Or something. In three tense games, Nelson emerged victorious, and takes $3,500, the Championship trophy, and ten Pro Points into the Puerto Rico Pro Tour spectacular just five days from now and then continues on to Wizards of the Coast HQ to battle for the 2010 **Magic Online** Community Cup June 9-11!


Congratulations to Brad Nelson, Grand Prix Washington D.C. Champion 2010!
