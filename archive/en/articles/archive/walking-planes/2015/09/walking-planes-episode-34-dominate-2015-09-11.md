How much do you know about the best *Magic* players in the world? Have you watched them play? Have you learned from their mastery of the game we love? There's something amazing about their performance under pressure. In the newest episode of Walking the Planes, we see the champions of the game stand out, even amid the buzz and excitement of PAX Prime. And because they are quite versatile mages, they show off a little acting and singing as well!
