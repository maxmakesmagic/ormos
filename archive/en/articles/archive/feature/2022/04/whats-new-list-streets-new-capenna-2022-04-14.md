What's New on The List for Streets of New Capenna
=================================================



 Posted in **Feature**

By Wizards of the Coast











Glitzy decadence. Hardboiled investigators. Muscled enforcers and five powerful families that run the city: [*Streets of New Capenna*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/streets-of-new-capenna) hits store shelves April 29, with Prerelease events kicking off at [your local game](https://locator.wizards.com/) store on April 22, and the *MTG Arena* and *Magic Online* releases following on April 28.


Just diving into the case here? For details on the new set, check out these articles covering all the facts you'll need to know for *Streets of New Capenna*:


* [*Streets of New Capenna* Product Overview](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/streets-of-new-capenna-product-overview-2022-04-07)
* [Collecting *Streets of New Capenna*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/collecting-streets-of-new-capenna-2022-04-07)
* [Behind the Scenes of *Streets of New Capenna*'s Stylish Booster Fun](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/behind-scenes-streets-new-capennas-stylish-booster-fun-2022-04-07)

*The List* usually consists of 300 cards picked from across *Magic*'s history. These appear about 25% of the time in the last card slot of Set Boosters. With each new set, a portion of these cards are replaced with cards that fit the latest set's mechanics and themes.


But this time, things are a little different—one might even say . . .*stranger*. Now, *The List* includes *Magic*-themed versions of *Secret Lair x Stranger Things* cards. These feature art that is different from the *Secret Lair* drop but the cards are mechanically identical and count as the same card as found in the *Secret Lair* drop when building decks—you can use four in most cases, or just one if you're playing Commander. (The artwork on cards featured in the *Secret Lair* drop remains unique to that product.)

![Elmar, Ulvenwald Informant](https://media.wizards.com/2022/slx/en_Vspd4MT46O.png)![Hargilde, Kindly Runechanter](https://media.wizards.com/2022/slx/en_boJjNSgTMV.png)![Othelm, Sigardian Outcast](https://media.wizards.com/2022/slx/en_3kGZhEGRSs.png)

What's more, to accommodate the *Secret Lair x Stranger Things* cards, *The List* for *Streets of New Capenna* has fewer cards—67 total. Of those, 58 are from *Magic*'s history that complement the narrative and mechanical themes of the set.


The overall distribution of *The List* cards in Set Boosters remains unchanged: they appear in the final card slot of Set Boosters about 25% of the time. On average, one in eight Set Boosters can potentially have a *Magic*-themed *Secret Lair x Stranger Things* card!


But there's even more jazzing up *The List* this time. We're always looking for new ways to enhance Set Boosters, so among those new cards from *Magic*'s history is a special non-foil Rafiq of the Many featuring new art and the [*Streets of New Capenna* golden age treatment](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/behind-scenes-streets-new-capennas-stylish-booster-fun-2022-04-07)!

Note that cards that appear in *The List* are not made legal in Standard if they were not legal before; cards retain their usual legality for play in the various [*Magic* formats](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/formats).


Here's a look back at past versions of *The List*:
