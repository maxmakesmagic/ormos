Here is the answer to yesterday's [Magic: The Puzzling](/en/articles/archive/magic-puzzling-2002-12-10).

The following chart goes through it step by step, and tracks your mana. Since mana from [Mishra's Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) can only be used to play artifacts, it must be tracked separately.
