Four-times Grand Prix winner Huang Hao-Shan sits opposite three times Grand Prix winner Alexander Hayne in the feature match area in Round 6. Huang's W/R deck features the consensus best common, uncommon and mythic in the set; Hayne's B/R deck features a rabble of removal and various aggressive creatures. Both sit at 15 points and undefeated.


While shuffling Hayne posed Huang a question: "You've won every GP you've been in, right?". 


"Only half!" Huang smiled.


Hayne won the roll but both players immediately mulliganed to six. "I mulliganed," Hayne said, "But he decided to keep it fair."



 They kept their six and the match commenced in earnest. Hayne's first two turns were a sole [Frenzied Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenzied+Goblin). Huang looked to be without a play until Hayne instructed the Goblin to attack, only to be surprised when Huang raised the alarm and ambushed the Goblin. Hayne laid out a [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) that Haung matched with a [Generator Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Generator+Servant), getting in with his surviving soldier token. Hayne played out a [Zof Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zof+Shade) and passed the turn.






*Huang Hao-Shan's got Soul AND Soldiers.*
