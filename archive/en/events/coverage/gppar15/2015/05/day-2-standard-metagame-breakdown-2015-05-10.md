171 decklists have all been sorted, checked, and counted, and now we have some numbers for you. Check out the following table first, we'll get to some further details after that:




| Deck Archetype | Number Played | Percentage of Field |
| Red Aggro | 24 | 14.0 |
| Abzan Aggro | 21 | 12.3 |
| Esper Dragons | 19 | 11.1 |
| Abzan Megamorph | 18 | 10.5 |
| Mardu Dragons | 17 | 9.9 |
| Abzan Control | 15 | 8.8 |
| Bant Megamorph | 11 | 6.4 |
| Green/White Megamorph | 11 | 6.4 |
| Sidisi Megamorph | 6 | 3.5 |
| Green Devotion with Red | 5 | 2.9 |
| Red/Green Dragons | 4 | 2.3 |
| Bant Heroic | 3 | 1.8 |
| Blue/Black Control | 2 | 1.2 |
| Jeskai Tokens | 2 | 1.2 |
| Others: | 13 | 7.6 |
| **Total:** | **171** | **100** |

One of the first things one may notice is that Red Aggro (two thirds splashing green, mostly for Atarka's Command, often for a singleton [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) as well), Abzan Aggro, and Esper Dragons still lead the way.


However, that's just half the story. Abzan Megamorph is listed next, in fourth place, but a case can be made that Abzan Megamorph, Bant Megamorph, Green/White Megamorph, Sidisi Megamorph, and some more obscure variations of the megamorph theme should really be combined into one macro archetype. They all have [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) and [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) in common, and while some play more aggressively than others, all of these decks work alike in a number of ways, share some key strengths and weaknesses, and are very much centered on the two eponymous megamorphs.


So if one were to consider Megamorph to be one archetype, how would the metagame breakdown change? Let's take a look:




| Deck Archetype | Number Played | Percentage of Field |
| Megamorph | 51 | 29.8 |
| Red Aggro | 24 | 14.0 |
| Abzan Aggro | 21 | 12.3 |
| Esper Dragons | 19 | 11.1 |
| Mardu Dragons | 17 | 9.9 |
| Abzan Control | 15 | 8.8 |
| Green Devotion with Red | 5 | 2.9 |
| Red/Green Dragons | 4 | 2.3 |
| Bant Heroic | 3 | 1.8 |
| Blue/Black Control | 2 | 1.2 |
| Jeskai Tokens | 2 | 1.2 |
| Others: | 8 | 4.7 |
| **Total:** | **171** | **100** |

Well, that gives quite the different picture now, doesn't it? The jury is still out on whether this is a legitimate way to view things. But the fact that [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) and [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) have long left [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai), [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster), and everyone else behind and are now the major players in Standard can hardly be denied.
