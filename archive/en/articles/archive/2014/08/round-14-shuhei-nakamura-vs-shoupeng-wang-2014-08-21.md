Nakamura came into the round on 36 points, needing a win or a draw to lock up Top 8, while Wang, paired up, needed to win to have a chance of making the final cut. Both players were playing Mono-Black, Nakamura with a White splash, Wang with Blue.



**Game 1**



 Nakamura opened with a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and took Wang's [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) before casting one of his own. Wang's [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) got Devour in Flesh'd, as did his follow-up [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon). Nakamura had another [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), which snaffled a [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel). Wang took advantage of Nakamura being tapped out to sneak some damage in with a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), knocking the Hall of Famer to 12. 


 A second attack was stopped with a [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight), and the two traded a pair of removal spells and a pair of [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s the following turns. Nakamura, who had had an active [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) for some time now, was comfortably ahead on lands and cards. 


 He exploited this by checking the coast was clear with a [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) and following up with a [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s, the latter of which Wang promptly shot. Nakamura was unfazed, playing his second copy and passing. The [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s started to multiply. Wang played what defence he could with a pair of Gray Merchants of Asphodel, but Nakamura's Rats punched through for lethal.

**Game 2**



 Both players traded discard spells back and forth for the first few turns before settling into the mid-game. Nakamura made the first move with an Erebos off the top of his library, Wang keeping pace with an [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections). 


 A water-testing [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) from Wang got killed with a [Devour Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+Flesh). Sensing an opening, Wang summoned a [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) he had been sandbagging for several turns. Nakamura tried another [Devour Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+Flesh) and Wang activated his [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) in response, but Nakamura had a [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) to off both the land and the Demon. 


 With the board empty, Nakamura switched to an aggressive gear and started swinging with a pair of [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s. Wang summoned his own Erebos but had nothing to stop the incoming lands. Nakamura held off attacking for a turn to summon a [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s and a [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel). In response to the Merchant's triggered ability, Wang had a pair of [Dark Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Betrayal)s on both his creatures to keep the devotion damage to a single digit from Nakamura's Erebos.
