The time: This Saturday, October 27th. The format: Standard with *Lorwyn*. The place: game stores and convention centers across the US ([States](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/states)) and the world ([Champs](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/champs)). Get ready to smash your Standard deck through the gauntlet and defend your home turf. To be eligible, all you need is a deck and residency in the region where you're playing.


Just for showing up, you'll get this (while supplies last): a full-art promo of *Lorwyn's* elf lord, [Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect).

If you crush your way all the way to the Top 8, you'll take home a *foil* full-art promo of the *Lorwyn* treefolk legend, [Doran, the Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower).
