*What's your favorite two-card combo, and why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** There are plenty of two-card combos that just flat-out win you the game if they go off undisrupted. [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) + [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) has made quite the stir in competitive Standard, and the also-Standard-legal combo of [Turntimber Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turntimber+Ranger) + [Xenograft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenograft) is pretty hilarious (and yes, that does work). And heck, if you're just going for power, how about [Time Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault) + [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key)?

But my *favorite* two-card combo isn't anything like that. Unless I'm in a purely competitive environment, instantly winning the game—or engaging in some unbounded loop that's very, very likely to win me the game—isn't anywhere close to what I want to be doing when I play **Magic**. What have I proven? What have I gained? What story will anybody tell about that game, other than "That guy is a jerk"?

I'm much more entertained by combos that do something ridiculous, but ultimately fair—the kind you'll tell a story about, whether you win or lose. [Basilisk Collar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk+Collar) + [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) (or [Bloodfire Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodfire+Colossus)!). [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) + [Gaea's Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Anthem). [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) plus... I don't know, [Avenger of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar). Or [Riku of Two Reflections](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riku+of+Two+Reflections). Or [Primordial Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primordial+Hydra). Or whatever. There's a huge number of these "fun but fair" combos, and I love many of them. The one that's been tickling my brain most recently is...

| Quicksilver Gargantuan | Spawnwrithe |

...[Quicksilver Gargantuan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Gargantuan) + [Spawnwrithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnwrithe). It's super-fragile, and honestly it's not even all that good. But every time my 7/7 trampler deals damage to a player, I get another 7/7 trampler with the same ability, and that is hilarious to me.
