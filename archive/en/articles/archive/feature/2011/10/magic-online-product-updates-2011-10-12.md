With *Innistrad* lurking just around the corner (available in the **Magic Online** Store on October 17), the *Zendikar* Block - which includes the *Zendikar*, *Worldwake*, and *Rise of the Eldrazi* sets - is no longer available for purchase following our October 12 downtime. 

We will also make a few additional changes to the **Magic Online** product lineup starting Wednesday, October 19.

First, **Magic Online** will stop selling intro pack and Event Deck products for all sets prior to the ***Magic** 2012* core set. This means we will be saying goodbye to the intro packs and Event Decks from *Scars of Mirrodin*, *Mirrodin Besieged*, and *New Phyrexia*. Every fall going forward, in conjunction with the first set in each new **Magic: The Gathering** block, we will stop selling the previous block's intro packs. 

Second, we will also say goodbye to all Duel Deck products released prior to 2011. Moving forward, all Duel Decks will be available for roughly one year before being retired.

Finally, starting with *Innistrad*, **Magic Online** will no longer carry Event Decks. While very effective in paper, Event Decks do not appear to meet the needs of the **Magic Online** player. **Magic Online** will continue to carry the intro packs that accompany each set. 

These changes will ensure that the newest and most exciting **Magic** releases are front and center for all **Magic Online** players and help improve the overall **Magic Online** experience. 

Don't forget that *Innistrad* prerelease events begin October 13 in **Magic Online**. Get out there and have fun.
