The second week of the [Pro Tour Qualifier–Kyoto](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/kyoto08-qualifiers) season is upon us, and we've got the Top 8 lists for you! What draft strategies did the aspiring pros utilize to earn victories in the Top 8? You'll have to view the lists to see!


Also in this issue, Decks of the Week is happy to bring you the start of the [Magic Cruise](/en/events/coverage/magic-cruise-qualifying-season-top-8-decklists) qualifier season! The Magic Cruise, for those who haven't heard, is an awesome opportunity being put on by Steve Port of Legion Events. Participants get to enjoy **Magic** on the high seas leaving from Galveston, Texas and touring parts of Mexico on a Carnival cruise. With nearly non-stop gaming provided to players on the Cruise (including a PTQ and *Conflux* Launch Party!), guest appearances by prominent **Magic** figures, and workshops covering all manner of **Magic**-related topics onboard, the Magic Cruise is bound to be a memorable event. And best of all, anyone can join! For more information, including how to get involved, visit [the official announcement](/en/events/coverage/magic-cruise-qualifying-season-top-8-decklists) from Legion Events.


Finally, we have a host of **Magic Online** lists, including the *Master's Edition 2* Championship Top 8 (review the draft [here](/en/articles/archive/draft-viewer-10152008-2008-10-15))! Enjoy!
