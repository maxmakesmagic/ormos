Neither player was particularly happy with their draft, considering the shenanigans their neighbors were pulling. Numerous color switches around them forced them into less-than-optimal positions. They made the best of a bad situation, though, and emerged with quality piles of cards. Thoren was green-red, and Davis was green-black, having shifted out of red late.


In the first game Davis almost stalled on lands, but a cycled [Barkhide Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler) got him his third, a forest he desperately needed. He played [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) in the face of [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith). Thoren played a face-down creature. Davis swung and played [Cabal Archon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Archon).


And that's when things went really badly. Thoren swung in and Davis let it in. Thoren flipped it over to be [Skirk Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando). That mean that the [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) could off the Archon, and the Commando took out the Legion.


"Yep, that's game." - Brian Davis

*(click to open full-size in a new window)*He kept his game face on, but had no play on his four lands. Thoren brought the beats and played [Elven Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders). Davis thought hard before throwing down [Snarling Undorak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snarling+Undorak). Thoren had no [Pinpoint Avalanche](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pinpoint+Avalanche) like he feared, but still traded his Commando for it with the help of the [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith).


Davis hit his fifth land and thought hard. He eventually chose to make a 4/4 [Stag Beetle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stag+Beetle). Thoren's army smashed in. Davis blocked and Thoren unmorphed his creature: [Skittish Valesk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skittish+Valesk).


Davis was already contemplating his doom, [Blackmail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackmail)ing away [Symbiotic Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Elf) and playing [Cabal Archon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Archon) before he realized that his [Stag Beetle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stag+Beetle) was still in play. Thoren had mistakenly morphed after combat damage was on the stack. It was a thin ray of hope for Davis.


It was quashed almost immediately as Thoren won the flip to keep his Valesk unmorphed. Even though Davis had [Wirewood Pride](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Pride) to save his Beetle in Combat, he had no answer for the [Elven Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders).


Thoren 1 - Davis 0

*(click to open full-size in a new window)*Thoren led with [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) again in the second game, earning a disgusted shout from Davis. He cycled [Solar Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Blast) to take down Davis's morphed Cabal Exectutioner, then dropped [Skirk Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando) to take out [Cabal Archon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Archon).


Davis was less than delighted. His [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) did two to Thoren as the [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) killed it. Thoren also made [Elven Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders). Davis made a [Wirewood Savage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Savage), and cycled Primal Boon to keep it out of the [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith)'s clutches. He got to trade with the [Skirk Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando) for his troubles.


But Thoren was far from finished. He added a morph creature and [Goblin Sledder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder). Davis tried fooling him with a morphed [Snarling Undorak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snarling+Undorak), but that just forced out a [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock). [Stag Beetle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stag+Beetle) would at least hold the fort, but the [Elven Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders) were dragging Davis down quickly. The last straw was when Thoren played a [Stag Beetle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stag+Beetle) of his own.


"He's got a [Stag Beetle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stag+Beetle) too?! That's like the best card I've drawn!" - Brian Davis


It was over right after that.


**Final Result:** Jens Thoren defeats Brian Davis 2-0
