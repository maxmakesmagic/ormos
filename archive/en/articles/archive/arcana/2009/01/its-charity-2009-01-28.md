[![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/113_childsplay.jpg)](http://www.childsplaycharity.org/)Every year, Penny Arcade runs [Child's Play](http://www.childsplaycharity.org/), a charity devoted to rounding up toys, games, and money for children's hospitals. And one of the key events is the annual [Charity Auction](http://www.childsplaycharity.org/cpdinner.php), at which various cool gaming-related things are auctioned off.

We bring this up because this year, the "tour of Wizards of the Coast and **Magic** R&D" went for $1,900 (which, the **Magic** brand team would like us to point out, is $300 more than the D&D tour went for), and the tour happened on Monday, conducted personally by Mark Rosewater. Congratulations to Aaron Doukas:

Aaron also brought his friend, Andrew Kaiser. Say hello, Andrew!

It turns out that they timed their visit well, because there just happened to be some *Conflux* around. And even though the prerelease was still a few days away (as it still is, if you [haven't made your plans yet](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases)), Mark Rosewater rounded up some R&D and **Magic** brand members for an impromptu *Conflux* sealed deck tournament.

The official winners of the tournament were Mark Gottlieb and Mark Globus, who were both undefeated. Auction Winner Aaron beat Magic R&D Director Aaron Forsythe *and* R&D VP Bill Rose, but lost to Mark Rosewater.

Aaron and Andrew left happy (and loaded down with *Conflux* and other **Magic** product), so we hope they got their $1,900 worth. And Wizards of the Coast and Child's Play look forward to doing this again next year!
