In the first game, Sushalskyy, playing red-white, brought the beats with, amongst other, heavy-hitting Minotaurs [Kragma Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kragma+Butcher) and [Fanatic of Mogis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis). Lehner's blue-black deck was more about small incremental advantages achieved through [Sigiled Starfish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigiled+Starfish) and [Siren of the Silent Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren+of+the+Silent+Song). He tried to race, but despite [Sudden Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm) to buy more time was not succesful.

In the second game, Sushalskyy was stuck on three lands for far too long. When Lehner added [Siren of the Fanged Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren+of+the+Fanged+Coast) to his team of [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker) and [Forlorn Pseudamma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forlorn+Pseudamma), Sushalskyy had but one creature ... and then one.


 


Unfortunately the final game was largely decided by Sushalskyy's mulligan to four. Lehner, having himself mulliganed to six, was able to recover much better, stole a creature with [Siren of the Fanged Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren+of+the+Fanged+Coast) and later the Siren even returned as a 4/4 via [Voyage's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End). It wasn't pretty, but at least, it meant that this was the first quarterfinal match to finish.


**Bernhard Lehner 2-1 Sergiy Sushalskyy**

Here it was Javier Dominguez's blue-white fliers against Ivan Floch's green-white monsters. [Supply-Line Cranes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supply-Line+Cranes), [Akroan Skyguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Skyguard) with [Stratus Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Walk), and [Deepwater Hypnotist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepwater+Hypnotist) with [Crystalline Nautilus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystalline+Nautilus) put the pressure on Floch who fought back with [Deserter's Quarters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deserter%27s+Quarters), [Ravenous Leucrocota](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Leucrocota), and [Hydra Broodmaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydra+Broodmaster). The 7/7, later 10/10, and its three 3/3s made the race close, but Dominguez decided it for himself. The unlikely key plays in that were [Breaching Hippocamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breaching+Hippocamp) and [Crypsis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypsis)—particularly good against [Deserter's Quarters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deserter%27s+Quarters).


 


For the second game, Dominguez was stuck on four Islands, even after [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination), and facing two early creatures plus [Feral Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Invocation). He cast Chorus of Tides, tried to draw out of his color screw via [Stratus Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Walk) only to meet [Shredding Winds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shredding+Winds), and never recovered.


[Akroan Skyguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Skyguard) plus [Stratus Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Walk) followed by [Supply-Line Cranes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supply-Line+Cranes) constituted Dominguez's offense for the deciding game, while Floch's deck had trouble to get going. When Dominguez cast [Voyage's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End) on Floch's single creature it was soon over.


**Javier Dominguez 2-1 Ivan Floch**


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/events/2014/gpwar14/qf_anteri_v_vanderhallen.jpg)*Fabrizio Anteri vs. Nicolas Vanderhallen*



 


[Font of Fertility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Font+of+Fertility) and an early [Ordeal of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Nylea) gave Fabrizio Anteri a huge mana boost in his green-on-green match against Nicolas Vanderhallen. The latter fought back valiantly with [Necrobite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrobite) and [Bow of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bow+of+Nylea), but when the Bow was lost to [Unravel the Æther](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unravel+the+%C3%86ther), Anteri could ride his fatties to victory.


 


Then it was Vanderhallen's turn to have the upper hand mana-wise. He hit his opponent's only Island with [Desecration Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Plague), severely crippling Anteri's development. This gave him enough time to stall the board with [Servant of Tymaret](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+Tymaret) and other creatures. Eventually [Noble Quarry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Quarry) and [Bow of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bow+of+Nylea) took over the game.


Time for game three, and here it again was Anteri who set the pace, with [Golden Hind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golden+Hind), [Kiora's Follower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%27s+Follower), [Chorus of the Tides](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chorus+of+the+Tides). Even [Bow of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bow+of+Nylea) couldn't help Vanderhallen, as Anteri smoothly bestowed [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) on his flier. Finally, Anteri's [Mistcutter Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistcutter+Hydra) sealed the deal.


**Fabrizio Anteri 2-1 Nicolas Vanderhallen**

Even though this match took the longest to actually finish, it was the most decisive victory. Ben Yu had well enough removal for Daniel Fior's blue-black deck's few fliers and just about the most massive ground defense imaginable. In the first game, Yu's two [Grim Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Guardian)s and [Nyx-Fleece Ram](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyx-Fleece+Ram) held the fort, while starting to work on Fior's lifetotal. Then, [Doomwake Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant) plus Armamnet of Nyx finished the job.


 


The second game again started with [Grim Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Guardian) and Nyx-Fleec Ram for Yu, and his [Scholar of Athreos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scholar+of+Athreos) meant he hardly even needed the [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) and second [Grim Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Guardian). Although it did speed up the process of draining all of Fior's life, of course.


**Ben Yu 2-0 Daniel Fior**
