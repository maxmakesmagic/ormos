The Grand Prix circuit visits Rio de Janeiro for the third time. The previous two Grand Prix were won by World Champions Jon Finkel (1998) and Carlos Romao (2001) — will you add your name to this illustrious list of winners? 

A fabulous tourist destination and host of the 2016 Olympic Games, the city of Rio de Janeiro is being completely remodeled and modernized, including the venue for the Grand Prix. This historic city has some new places to show!

 In addition to the main event, the side events of Grand Prix Rio de Janeiro will indeed become a landmark for its participants. With side event prizes including a wide range of **Magic** products, airplane tickets to other Grand Prix, Vintage cards and complete sets, the side event schedule will suit all tastes and players. If you're looking for some special treatment during the weekend, be sure to check out the Rarity Program. Let's Collect Brasil invites you to have a magical weekend at Grand Prix Rio de Janeiro! 

  

 *The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to step up your game, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic** players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition over three days. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, the Grand Prix features a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings. Side-event tournaments begin Friday, with the Grand Prix main event running Saturday and Sunday.

Minors must have a parent or guardian’s signature on this form. Publicity releases will be collected during registration. 


**Tournament Format**
  


* [Standard](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrstandard)
* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day 2 that they used on Day 1.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

(For Grand Prix Rio de Janeiro, the cutoff date will be March 6.) Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria:

### Rarity Program

 The Rarity Program offers players the option of making the weekend experience that much more special. Players can choose either the Uncommon level (for R$ 30,00) or the Rare level (for R$ 100.00). All costs are in addition to the main event registration fee. 


**Uncommon**: Players will have access to the Sleep-in Special, a process which allows the player, if he or she has byes, to sign up on Friday, March 8 and not need to be on site until after their byes end. You must provide your decklist before the players meeting on Saturday morning. You may give your decklist to the event staff when you register or at any time on Friday, but once given it cannot be returned or changed. 


**Rare**: In addition to the Sleep-in Special, players receive these benefits: 




* Fixed Seating: The participant will play all matches on the first day of the main event at the same table (to maintain the integrity of the tournament, the program that runs the **Magic** events may pair two "Rare" players with certain seats, temporarily moving one player out of his or her assigned seat. )
* Rare Lounge Access: Unique space, with many free benefits such as bottles of water, fresh fruit, masseuse, electronic games, etc.
* Exclusive Access to Artists: Get your cards signed by the artists without having to wait in line, plus meet and greet the artists at a special time exclusive to "Rare" players.
* Signup for special side events: Earn free entry into one side event of your choice, and skip waiting in lines for all side events.
