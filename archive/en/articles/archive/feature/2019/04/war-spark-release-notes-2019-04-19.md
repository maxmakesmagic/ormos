The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Support.Wizards.com](http://support.wizards.com/).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

Major Set Theme: Planeswalkers
------------------------------


The *War of the Spark* set is packed with battles between the most powerful and iconic characters of *Magic*. There are more than thirty Planeswalkers in the set! Many are familiar, but there are some new faces as well. To reflect the number of characters in the story, in every *War of the Spark* booster pack, you'll find a planeswalker card. Planeswalkers appear at every rarity except common.


This set also explores new design space for planeswalker cards. In addition to one or more loyalty abilities, each planeswalker card features an ability that gives them additional impact on the battlefield without affecting their loyalty.


![Ob Nixilis, the Hate-Twisted](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_qFTbjno74b.png)


Ob Nixilis, the Hate-Twisted  

3BB  

Legendary Planeswalker — Nixilis  

5  

Whenever an opponent draws a card, Ob Nixilis, the Hate-Twisted deals 1 damage to that player.  

–2: Destroy target creature. Its controller draws two cards.


The rules for planeswalker cards are unchanged for this release.


* A planeswalker enters the battlefield with a number of loyalty counters on it equal to its starting loyalty, printed in the lower-right corner of the card. Damage dealt to a planeswalker causes that planeswalker to lose that many loyalty counters.
* If a planeswalker's loyalty reaches 0, it's put into its owner's graveyard just like a creature with 0 toughness. There's no way to bring a planeswalker to 0 loyalty and then sacrifice it for another effect.
* You may activate one loyalty ability of each planeswalker you control during your turn any time you could cast a sorcery. To do so, you pay its loyalty cost by adding or removing the appropriate number of loyalty counters.
* If a planeswalker has a triggered or static ability, that ability continues to function even after you've activated a loyalty ability of that planeswalker.
* When your planeswalker spell resolves during your turn, you have priority before any other player can cast spells (including instant spells) or activate abilities. If it's your main phase and the stack is empty, you can activate an ability of one of your planeswalkers before anyone can try to remove it from the battlefield.
* The easiest way to get rid of planeswalkers is by attacking them. As you choose attacking creatures, you choose for each of those creatures whether it's attacking the defending player or one of the planeswalkers the defending player controls. That player can block creatures attacking their planeswalkers with creatures they control. Any unblocked creatures attacking a planeswalker deal their combat damage to that planeswalker, and that planeswalker doesn't any deal damage back.
* Some spells can deal damage directly to planeswalkers. These may say specifically that they can target a planeswalker or deal damage to a planeswalker, but they may also say that they deal damage to "any target" or similar. The phrase "any target" means "target creature, planeswalker, or player."
* Planeswalker cards have subtypes (such as "Nixilis" or "Jace") that other cards may reference, but these carry no inherent rules meaning. For example, you can't control two Ob Nixilis, the Hate-Twisted because they are legendary permanents subject to the "legend rule," but you may control both Ob Nixilis, the Hate-Twisted and [Ob Nixilis Reignited](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ob+Nixilis+Reignited) (from the *Battle for Zendikar* set).
* Some cards refer to "planeswalker spells." Many cards in the *War of the Spark* set are named after a planeswalker (Ob Nixilis's Cruelty, for example), but these are not planeswalker spells. A planeswalker spell is a spell with the card type planeswalker.



---

New Keyword Action: Amass
-------------------------


Nicol Bolas's undead army, the Dreadhorde, is swarming Ravnica. *Amass* is a new mechanic that creates and grows a Zombie Army token with +1/+1 counters on it. Further amass spells make your horde even more formidable!


![Vizier of the Scorpion](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_gwOUXjoDLW.png)


Vizier of the Scorpion  

2B  

Creature — Zombie Wizard  

1/1  

When Vizier of the Scorpion enters the battlefield, amass 1. *(Put a +1/+1 counter on an Army you control. If you don't control one, create a 0/0 black Zombie Army creature token first.)*  

Zombie tokens you control have deathtouch.


The official rules for amass are as follows:


701.43. Amass


701.43a To amass N means "If you don't control an Army creature, create a 0/0 black Zombie Army creature token. Choose an Army creature you control. Put N +1/+1 counters on that creature."


701.43b The phrase "the [subtype] you amassed" refers to the creature you chose, whether or not it received counters.


* Army is a new creature type. It's possible to control a nontoken Army (perhaps a creature with the changeling ability) and, through combinations of other cards, it's possible to control multiple Army tokens. When instructed to amass, you may put +1/+1 counters on any of your Army creatures, and you may choose a different one each time.
* If you don't control an Army, the Zombie Army token that you create enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature. Any abilities that trigger when a creature with a certain power enters the battlefield, such as that of [Mentor of the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek), will see the token enter as a 0/0 creature before it gets +1/+1 counters.
* Some spells that amass may require targets. If each target chosen is an illegal target as that spell tries to resolve, it doesn't resolve. You won't amass.
* Some cards that cause you to amass also provide bonuses to "Zombie tokens." These affect any token that happens to be a Zombie, not just a Zombie Army you've amassed.



---

Returning Keyword Ability: Proliferate
--------------------------------------


*Proliferate* returns as means of resistance against the forces of Bolas. It's an exciting way to build a planeswalker's loyalty and an effective way to reach their ultimate abilities quickly. There are also plenty of +1/+1 counters to build up the board to fight Bolas's growing forces—or perhaps to join them.


![Contentious Plan](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_nPnm0AnBB8.png)


Contentious Plan  

1U  

Sorcery  

Proliferate. *(Choose any number of permanents and/or players, then give each another counter of each kind already there.)*  

Draw a card.


The rules for proliferate have changed since proliferate appeared in the *Scars of Mirrodin* block. Under previous rules, if a player or permanent had multiple kinds of counters, you could give that player or permanent one counter of only one of those kinds. Under the new rules, you give the player or permanent one counter of each of those kinds.


* The *War of the Spark* set doesn't include any ways for players to have counters, but some cards in other sets say that a player "gets" a counter of a certain kind. Notably, emblems aren't counters.
* You can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them.
* You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
* Players can respond to the spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.
* If a spell or ability puts counters on a player or permanent and then instructs you to proliferate, choosing that player or permanent will give that player or permanent another of those counters.
* Putting loyalty counters on planeswalkers doesn't cause their loyalty abilities to be activated.
* Some spells that proliferate may require targets. If each target chosen is an illegal target as that spell tries to resolve, it doesn't resolve. You won't proliferate.



---

Returning Mechanic: Hybrid Mana
-------------------------------


Hybrid mana symbols represent a cost that can be paid with either of two colors. For example, b/r can be paid with either B or R. It's both a black and a red mana symbol.


![Angrath, Captain of Chaos](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_27dR016eQy.png)


Angrath, Captain of Chaos  

2b/rb/r  

Legendary Planeswalker — Angrath  

5  

Creatures you control have menace.  

−2: Amass 2. *(Put two +1/+1 counters on an Army you control. If you don't control one, create a 0/0 black Zombie Army creature token first.)*


* As you cast a spell or activate an activated ability with hybrid mana symbols in its cost, you choose which color of mana you will spend for each hybrid mana symbol. You do this at the same time you would choose modes or choose a value for an X in a mana cost. For example, you choose whether you'll cast Angrath, Captain of Chaos by paying 2BB, 2BR, or 2RR.
* Each two-color hybrid symbol adds 1 to a card's converted mana cost. For example, the converted mana cost of Angrath, Captain of Chaos is 4.
* A card with hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost is each color that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. For example, Angrath, Captain of Chaos is black and red, even if you cast it with only black mana.
* Similarly, a card's color identity (used in the Commander variant) always includes both of the colors that appear in a hybrid mana symbol on that card. Angrath, Captain of Chaos can't be included in a Commander deck whose commander has a color identity of only black, even though Angrath could be cast with only black mana.



---

Cycle: The God-Eternals
-----------------------


The Gods of the Trials from the plane of Amonkhet have changed quite a bit since we last saw them. These four Gods—as well as Ravnica's own Raze-Boar—feature a new take on the resilience of godhood.


![God-Eternal Oketra](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_8126pxPidb.png)


God-Eternal Oketra  

3WW  

Legendary Creature — Zombie God  

3/6  

Double strike  

Whenever you cast a creature spell, create a 4/4 black Zombie Warrior creature token with vigilance.  

When God-Eternal Oketra dies or is put into exile from the battlefield, you may put it into its owner's library third from the top.


* If one of these Gods leaves the graveyard or exile while its last ability is on the stack, it will remain in its new zone, even if that zone is a graveyard or exile.
* If the God's owner has two or fewer cards in their library, the God is put on the bottom of their library as its last ability resolves.
* If you control another player's God when it dies, you decide whether to put that card into its owner's library.
* If an effect exiles the God and immediately returns it to the battlefield, its last ability triggers but will have no effect. However, if an effect exiles it and would return it to the battlefield at a later time, the God's ability may return that card its owner's library first. If it does, the effect that exiled it won't return it later.
* In a multiplayer game, if you put another player's God onto the battlefield under your control, it will be exiled as you leave the game. If you were still the controller of that God, you would control its triggered ability but you have left the game; that ability won't resolve and the card remains in exile. Similarly, if you lose the game at the same time that another player's God that you put onto the battlefield is destroyed, it remains in its owner's graveyard.
* If one of these Gods would die and it's your commander in the Commander variant, you may put it into the command zone instead. If you save your commander this way, it doesn't die and you won't put it into your library. The same is true if it would be exiled.



---

Cycle: Triumph of the Gatewatch
-------------------------------


We saw their crushing defeat in the *Hour of Devastation* set, and now we see the Gatewatch triumph over adversity. This cycle of spells is stronger if you control a planeswalker of the appropriate type.


![Jace's Triumph](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_Nmu0VnpRFv.png)


Jace's Triumph  

2U  

Sorcery  

Draw two cards. If you control a Jace planeswalker, draw three cards instead.


* Whether you control an appropriate planeswalker is checked only as the spell resolves.
* Controlling more than one planeswalker of the appropriate type won't have any more of a benefit than just controlling one.



---

CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES
===================


![Ajani, the Greathearted](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_XGbUZxpEtT.png)


Ajani, the Greathearted  

2GW  

Legendary Planeswalker — Ajani  

5  

Creatures you control have vigilance.  

+1: You gain 3 life.  

−2: Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control and a loyalty counter on each other planeswalker you control.


* If a planeswalker you control is also a creature (most likely because it's Gideon), that planeswalker receives both a +1/+1 counter and a loyalty counter as Ajani's last ability resolves.
* If Ajani is somehow a creature as his last ability resolves, he'll get a +1/+1 counter.



---

![Ajani's Pridemate](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_Qt6QAHJ72a.png)


Ajani's Pridemate  

1W  

Creature — Cat Soldier  

2/2  

Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on Ajani's Pridemate.


* The ability of Ajani's Pridemate triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from [Ajani's Welcome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Welcome) or 2 life from Battlefield Promotion.
* If Ajani's Pridemate is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from its ability in time to save it.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Ajani's Pridemate's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of Ajani's Pridemate triggers only once.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.



---

![Arboreal Grazer](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_6ewc03ehdY.png)


Arboreal Grazer  

G  

Creature — Beast  

0/3  

Reach  

When Arboreal Grazer enters the battlefield, you may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield tapped.


* Arboreal Grazer's effect doesn't count as playing a land. It can put a land card onto the battlefield even if you've already played your land for the turn.



---

![Arlinn, Voice of the Pack](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_bs9pdVJN9t.png)


Arlinn, Voice of the Pack  

4GG  

Legendary Planeswalker — Arlinn  

7  

Each creature you control that's a Wolf or a Werewolf enters the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on it.  

−2: Create a 2/2 green Wolf creature token.


* A creature that's a Wolf or Werewolf enters the battlefield with one +1/+1 counter if it would otherwise enter with no +1/+1 counters.
* A creature that's both a Wolf and a Werewolf receives only one additional +1/+1 counter from Arlinn's ability.
* If Arlinn leaves the battlefield before her last ability resolves, most likely because she only had 2 loyalty when you activated the ability, the Wolf token won't enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter.



---

![Arlinn's Wolf](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_N4Q4wE6e84.png)


Arlinn's Wolf  

2G  

Creature — Wolf  

3/2  

Arlinn's Wolf can't be blocked by creatures with power 2 or less.


* Once a creature with power 3 or greater has blocked this creature, changing the power of the blocking creature won't cause this creature to become unblocked.



---

![Ashiok, Dream Render](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_h0nVvDjfu6.png)


Ashiok, Dream Render  

1u/bu/b  

Legendary Planeswalker — Ashiok  

5  

Spells and abilities your opponents control can't cause their controller to search their library.  

−1: Target player puts the top four cards of their library into their graveyard. Then exile each opponent's graveyard.


* Spells and abilities your opponents control may cause other players to search their libraries, and spells and abilities you control may cause your opponents to search their libraries.
* If an effect says "You may search your library . . . If you do, shuffle your library" or "You may search your library . . . then shuffle your library," your opponents can't choose to search, so they won't shuffle.
* If an effect says "Search your library . . . then shuffle your library," your opponents shuffle their libraries even though they can't search.
* Effects that instruct your opponents to reveal or look at cards from the top of their libraries will still work. Only effects that use the word "search" are affected.
* If Ashiok's last ability targets an opponent, the cards put into their graveyard will be among the cards exiled by the ability. No player may take any actions between the time the cards are put into a graveyard and the time your opponents' graveyards are all exiled.



---

![Ashiok's Skulker](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_tOhdvnOA2C.png)


Ashiok's Skulker  

4U  

Creature — Nightmare  

3/5  

3U: Ashiok's Skulker can't be blocked this turn.


* Once this creature has been blocked, activating its ability won't change or undo that block.



---

![Awakening of Vitu-Ghazi](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_QAhIHkb6sJ.png)


Awakening of Vitu-Ghazi  

3GG  

Instant  

Put nine +1/+1 counters on target land you control. It becomes a legendary 0/0 Elemental creature with haste named Vitu-Ghazi. It's still a land.


* Awakening of Vitu-Ghazi doesn't untap the land that becomes a creature.
* The target land loses the name it had, and its name is just Vitu-Ghazi. It keeps any types and abilities it had.
* Awakening of Vitu-Ghazi's effect lasts indefinitely. It doesn't wear off during the cleanup step.



---

![Band Together](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_JDHX93PL3A.png)


Band Together  

2G  

Instant  

Up to two target creatures you control each deal damage equal to their power to another target creature.


* If one of the two target creatures you control is an illegal target as Band Together resolves, the other will still deal damage equal to its power.
* If the last target creature is an illegal target as Band Together resolves, or if both of the first targets are illegal targets, no creature deals or is dealt damage.



---

![Battlefield Promotion](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_60lO144FqP.png)


Battlefield Promotion  

1W  

Instant  

Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature. That creature gains first strike until end of turn. You gain 2 life.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Battlefield Promotion tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You don't gain 2 life.



---

![Bioessence Hydra](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_fipIynEv9T.png)


Bioessence Hydra  

3GU  

Creature — Hydra Mutant  

4/4  

Trample  

Bioessence Hydra enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it for each loyalty counter on planeswalkers you control.  

Whenever one or more loyalty counters are put on planeswalkers you control, put that many +1/+1 counters on Bioessence Hydra.


* Abilities that trigger when counters are put on a permanent trigger when a permanent enters the battlefield with counters and when a player puts counters on a permanent.
* If Bioessence Hydra enters the battlefield at the same time as a planeswalker you control, the loyalty counters that planeswalker will receive won't be counted to determine how many counters Bioessence Hydra enters the battlefield with, but they will cause its last ability to trigger.



---

![Blast Zone](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_rvC4Q2d699.png)


Blast Zone  

Land  

Blast Zone enters the battlefield with a charge counter on it.  

T: Add C.  

XX, T: Put X charge counters on Blast Zone.  

3, T, Sacrifice Blast Zone: Destroy each nonland permanent with converted mana cost equal to the number of charge counters on Blast Zone.


* An activation cost of XX means that you pay twice X. If you want X to be 3, you pay 6 to activate Blast Zone's ability.
* Tokens that aren't a copy of something else don't have a mana cost. Anything without a mana cost normally has a converted mana cost of 0.
* If a permanent has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.



---

![Bleeding Edge](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_YSFqSujXAk.png)


Bleeding Edge  

1BB  

Sorcery  

Up to one target creature gets -2/-2 until end of turn. Amass 2. *(Put two +1/+1 counters on an Army you control. If you don't control one, create a 0/0 black Zombie Army creature token first.)*


* You may cast Bleeding Edge without choosing a target creature. You'll just amass 2. However, if you choose a target and that target become illegal before Bleeding Edge resolves, the spell won't resolve and you won't amass.



---

![Blindblast](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_1oOV7C8BIt.png)


Blindblast  

2R  

Instant  

Blindblast deals 1 damage to target creature. That creature can't block this turn.  

Draw a card.


* Casting Blindblast after a creature has blocked won't remove the blocking creature from combat unless the damage Blindblast deals causes that creature to die. It won't cause the creature it blocked to become unblocked even if the blocking creature does die.
* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Blindblast tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You won't draw a card.



---

![Bolas's Citadel](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_RI1OiiW86r.png)


Bolas's Citadel  

3BBB  

Legendary Artifact  

You may look at the top card of your library any time.  

You may play the top card of your library. If you cast a spell this way, pay life equal to its converted mana cost rather than pay its mana cost.  

T, Sacrifice ten nonland permanents: Each opponent loses 10 life.


* Bolas's Citadel lets you look at the top card of your library whenever you want (with one restriction—see below), even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand.
* If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell, playing a land, or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until you finish doing so. This means that if you cast the top card of your library, you can't look at the next one until you're done paying for that spell.
* You must follow the normal timing permissions and restrictions of the cards you play from your library.
* You can play a land card from the top of your library only if you have available land plays remaining.
* If a spell has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
* If you cast a spell for another cost "rather than pay its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Spark Harvest, those must be paid to cast the card.
* Bolas's Citadel may be one of the permanents you sacrifice to activate its last ability.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, the last ability of Bolas's Citadel causes the opposing team to lose 20 life.



---

![Bolt Bend](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_07httIRH2b.png)


Bolt Bend  

3R  

Instant  

This spell costs 3 less to cast if you control a creature with power 4 or greater.  

Change the target of target spell or ability with a single target.


* Once you announce that you're casting Bolt Bend, no player may take actions until the spell has been paid for. Notably, opponents can't try to change whether you control a creature with power 4 or greater.
* Once you've cast Bolt Bend, losing control of all creatures with power 4 or greater won't affect the spell or cause you to pay more mana.
* The single target that the target spell or ability targets doesn't have to be a creature you control with power 4 or greater.
* You don't choose the new target for the spell or ability until Bolt Bend resolves. You must change the target if possible. However, you can't change the target to an illegal target. If there are no legal targets to choose from, the target isn't changed. It doesn't matter if the original target has somehow become illegal itself.
* If a spell or ability targets multiple things, you can't target it with Bolt Bend, even if all but one of those targets have become illegal.
* If a spell or ability targets the same player or object multiple times, you can't target it with Bolt Bend.

* If a creature you control with power 4 or greater has menace, it can't be blocked by only one creature and it can't be blocked by more than one creature, so it simply can't be blocked.

Chandra, Fire Artisan  

2RR  

Legendary Planeswalker — Chandra  

4  

Whenever one or more loyalty counters are removed from Chandra, Fire Artisan, she deals that much damage to target opponent or planeswalker.  

+1: Exile the top card of your library. You may play it this turn.  

−7: Exile the top seven cards of your library. You may play them this turn.


* Chandra's first ability triggers if she loses loyalty from being dealt damage, from her last loyalty ability being activated, or because an effect removes loyalty counters from her. If an effect simply causes Chandra to leave the battlefield, no counters were removed and so her ability doesn't trigger.
* If multiple creatures deal combat damage to Chandra at the same time, those counters are all removed at once, and her first ability triggers only once.
* If all of Chandra's loyalty counters are removed, her first ability has her deal damage even though she's left the battlefield.
* Chandra's loyalty abilities don't change when you can play the exiled cards. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty. If you exile a land card, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.
* Casting an exiled card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.

* If Chandra's Pyrohelix targets two creatures and one becomes an illegal target, the remaining target is dealt 1 damage, not 2.

* Command the Dreadhorde deals damage to you before the creature and planeswalker cards are put onto the battlefield, but if this brings your life total to 0 or less, those creatures and planeswalkers enter the battlefield before you lose the game. Any abilities they have that trigger when they enter the battlefield won't resolve if you lose the game, but their static abilities (such as that of [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel)) may help you survive with 0 or less life.
* If a card in a graveyard has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, the creatures and planeswalkers you control from Command the Dreadhorde's effect are exiled.

−1: Target player discards a card.


* If an opponent has two or more cards in their hand as their upkeep begins, Davriel's first ability won't trigger. No player may take any actions during a turn before the turn's upkeep begins. Because the upkeep step is before the draw step, that player won't have drawn a card for the turn yet.
* If an opponent has one or fewer cards in hand as Davriel's first ability triggers but has two or more cards in hand as that ability resolves, Davriel doesn't deal damage to them.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Davriel's first ability triggers for each opponent separately as appropriate during that player's team's upkeep.

Choose up to four target cards in your graveyard. If you control a Bolas planeswalker, return those cards to your hand. Otherwise, an opponent chooses two of them. Leave the chosen cards in your graveyard and put the rest into your hand.  

Exile Deliver Unto Evil.


* Whether you control a Bolas planeswalker is checked only as this spell resolves.
* If some of the targets chosen are no longer legal targets as Deliver Unto Evil resolves, an opponent chooses among the targets that remain legal. If no targets remain legal, the spell doesn't resolve. It's put into its owner's graveyard and isn't exiled.
* You may cast Deliver Unto Evil with fewer than four targets. However, if you don't control a Bolas planeswalker as Deliver Unto Evil resolves, your opponent will choose two of however many cards you did target (or one or zero, if you chose fewer than two) and the remainder (if any) will be put into your hand.
* You may cast Deliver Unto Evil with no targets if you wish. It will be exiled, and nothing else happens.

No player may take actions between the time you choose which permanents to sacrifice and the time Devouring Hellion is on the battlefield with those counters.
* If any of the sacrificed permanents have abilities that trigger when Devouring Hellion enters the battlefield (such as that of Kronch Wrangler), those abilities won't trigger.
* If Devouring Hellion somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature or planeswalker, you can't sacrifice that creature or planeswalker. You may choose only permanents that are already on the battlefield.

Domri, Anarch of Bolas  

1RG  

Legendary Planeswalker — Domri  

3  

Creatures you control get +1/+0.  

+1: Add R or G. Creature spells you cast this turn can't be countered.  

−2: Target creature you control fights target creature you don't control.


* Because it's a loyalty ability, Domri's first loyalty ability isn't a mana ability. It can be activated only any time you could cast a sorcery. It uses the stack and can be responded to.
* After Domri's first loyalty ability has resolved, no creature spells you cast can be countered during that turn, not just the one you spend the mana on.
* A spell or ability that counters spells can still target a creature spell you control after Domri's first loyalty ability has resolved. When that spell or ability resolves, the creature spell won't be countered, but any additional effects of that spell or ability will still happen.
* If Domri leaves the battlefield before his last ability resolves, most likely because he only had 2 loyalty when you activated the ability, the creature won't have +1/+0 from Domri's static ability while it fights.
* If either target is an illegal target as Domri's last ability resolves, no creature will deal or be dealt damage.

5  

Artifact, instant, and sorcery spells your opponents cast cost 1 more to cast.  

−1: Until your next turn, prevent all damage that would be dealt to and dealt by target permanent an opponent controls.


* Dovin's loyalty ability can target any permanent an opponent controls, not just one that can deal or be dealt damage.
* Once Dovin's loyalty ability resolves, the damage prevention continues to apply even if Dovin leaves the battlefield.
* In a multiplayer game, if you leave the game after Dovin's last ability resolves but before your next turn begins, its effect lasts until your next turn would have begun. It neither expires immediately nor lasts indefinitely.

Whenever Dreadhorde Arcanist attacks, you may cast target instant or sorcery card with converted mana cost less than or equal to Dreadhorde Arcanist's power from your graveyard without paying its mana cost. If that card would be put into your graveyard this turn, exile it instead.


* The instant or sorcery card you target must have converted mana cost less than or equal to Dreadhorde Arcanist's power immediately after Dreadhorde Arcanist has attacked. Any other abilities that trigger when creatures you control attack won't have resolved yet.
* If Dreadhorde Arcanist leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, use its power as it last existed on the battlefield to check whether the card is still a legal target.
* If you cast the card, you do so as part of the resolution of Dreadhorde Arcanist's triggered ability. You can't wait to cast it later in the turn. Timing permissions based on a card's type are ignored, and the spell resolve before blockers are declared.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Spark Harvest, you must pay those to cast the card.
* If the card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.

Whenever a Zombie token you control with power 6 or greater attacks, it gains lifelink until end of turn.


* The power of the Zombie token is checked only immediately after it attacks. Any other abilities that trigger when creatures you control attack won't have resolved yet.
* If the token's power changes later in the turn after it has attacked, including while Dreadhorde Invasion's second ability is on the stack, it won't cause the token to gain or lose lifelink.

* If the target creature has less than 4 toughness, Enter the God-Eternals still deals 4 damage to it and you'll gain 4 life.
* If the target creature is no longer a legal target as the spell resolves but the player is a legal target, no creature is dealt damage and you gain no life, but the target player still moves the top cards of their library and you still amass 4.
* If the target player is no longer a legal target as the spell resolves but the creature is a legal target, the creature is dealt damage, you gain that much life, and you amass 4. No player moves cards from their library.
* If both targets are no longer legal targets as the spell tries to resolve, it doesn't resolve. You don't amass 4.
* If the target creature is dealt lethal damage by Enter the God-Eternals, it'll still be on the battlefield while you gain life, the target player moves cards, and you amass 4. Any abilities it has may affect these actions and may trigger on them.
* Abilities that trigger while Enter the God-Eternals is resolving or that trigger as the target creature dies are all put onto the stack after the spell has finished resolving and the target creature has (if lethally damaged) died.

When Fblthp, the Lost enters the battlefield, draw a card. If it entered from your library or was cast from your library, draw two cards instead.  

When Fblthp becomes the target of a spell, shuffle Fblthp into its owner's library.


* There's normally no way to cast Fblthp from your library or to have it enter the battlefield from your library. You'll have to use other effects to find Fblthp for the bonus card draw.
* If an effect exiles Fblthp from your library and then lets you cast that card, it's cast from exile, not from your library.
* Fblthp's last ability triggers only if it's on the battlefield when it becomes the target.
* Fblthp's last ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* If the spell that targets Fblthp has no other targets, it won't resolve (because it no longer has a legal target after Fblthp has gotten totally lost in your library).

Flying  

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that targets a creature you control, exile that card instead of putting it into your graveyard as it resolves. If you do, return it to your hand at the beginning of the next end step.


* If Feather is still on the battlefield as you finish casting an instant or sorcery spell that targets one or more creatures you control, its ability triggers. The replacement effect that exiles that spell and the delayed triggered ability to return it to your hand both take effect even if Feather leaves the battlefield after you've cast the spell.
* The spell may have any other targets in addition to a creature you control.
* If an instant or sorcery spell you cast that targets your creature doesn't resolve for any reason (either because another spell or ability counters it or because all its targets are illegal as it tries to resolve), it won't be exiled. You won't return it to your hand.
* If an instant or sorcery spell's own effect instructs you to exile it or put it anywhere else, it won't try to be put into your graveyard or exiled with Feather's effect, so you won't return it to your hand.
* If another replacement effect instructs you to exile an instant or sorcery spell, such as that of Dreadhorde Arcanist or the flashback keyword, you may choose to apply Feather's replacement effect first. If you do, Feather's delayed triggered ability will return that card to your hand.
* If you cast an instant or sorcery spell that you don't own, it won't try to be put into your graveyard, so you won't exile it with Feather's effect or return it to your hand.

![Finale of Eternity](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_Pn3FKtBii8.png)


Finale of Eternity  

XBB  

Sorcery  

Destroy up to three target creatures with toughness X or less. If X is 10 or more, return all creature cards from your graveyard to the battlefield.


* Finale of Eternity can target up to three creatures that each have toughness X or less. That is, their total toughness doesn't have to be X or less.
* If some but not all of the target creatures you choose are illegal targets as Finale of Eternity resolves, the legal targets are still destroyed and, if X is 10 or more, you still return cards to the battlefield.
* If some or all of the targets are legal targets but aren't destroyed, most likely because they have indestructible, you'll still return cards to the battlefield if X is 10 or more.
* If you target a creature you own and X is 10 or more, that card will be among those returned to the battlefield.
* Any abilities that trigger on the target creatures dying or on the creatures returning to the battlefield will all be put onto the stack after Finale of Eternity has finished resolving. If it's your turn, your opponent's triggers resolve first, even though their creatures died before your creatures entered the battlefield.
* You may cast Finale of Eternity without choosing any target creatures. If X is 10 or more, you'll just return all creature cards from your graveyard to the battlefield. However, if you choose any targets and all of those targets become illegal before the spell tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve and you won't put any cards onto the battlefield.

![Finale of Promise](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_1csmjesh5X.png)


Finale of Promise  

XRR  

Sorcery  

You may cast up to one target instant card and/or up to one target sorcery card from your graveyard each with converted mana cost X or less without paying their mana costs. If a card cast this way would be put into your graveyard this turn, exile it instead. If X is 10 or more, copy each of those spells twice. You may choose new targets for the copies.


* As Finale of Promise resolves, first you cast the target instant card and/or the target sorcery card in either order. Then, if X is 10 or more, you copy each of those twice and put the copies on the stack in any order. The copies will resolve before the original spells.
* A split card that's an instant and a sorcery card may be the target of Finale of Promise twice. However, once you cast that card once, it can't be cast a second time.
* If a spell has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Spark Harvest, you must pay those to cast the card.
* If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one—" or the like), the copies will have the same mode or modes. You can't choose different ones.
* If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can). The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copies. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.
* The copies that Finale of Promise creates are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.

Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, proliferate. *(Choose any number of permanents and/or players, then give each another counter of each kind already there.)*

Gideon Blackblade  

1WW  

Legendary Planeswalker — Gideon  

4  

As long as it's your turn, Gideon Blackblade is a 4/4 Human Soldier creature with indestructible that's still a planeswalker.  

Prevent all damage that would be dealt to Gideon Blackblade during your turn.  

+1: Up to one other target creature you control gains your choice of vigilance, lifelink, or indestructible until end of turn.  

−6: Exile target nonland permanent.


* If an effect causes Gideon to lose all abilities during your turn, he's still a Human Soldier creature and a Gideon planeswalker.
* If an Equipment becomes attached to Gideon while he's a creature, it'll become unattached during the next upkeep that isn't yours. The same is true of any Auras that become attached to Gideon that can't enchant a noncreature planeswalker.
* Any counters that are put on Gideon remain on him while he's not a creature, even if they have no effect on a noncreature planeswalker.
* If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon during your turn, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.
* You choose which ability the target creature gains as Gideon's first loyalty ability resolves, not as you activate it.

Gideon, the Oathsworn *(Planeswalker Deck only)*  

4WW  

Legendary Planeswalker — Gideon  

4  

Whenever you attack with two or more non-Gideon creatures, put a +1/+1 counter on each of those creatures.  

+2: Until end of turn, Gideon, the Oathsworn becomes a 5/5 white Soldier creature that's still a planeswalker. Prevent all damage that would be dealt to him this turn. *(He can't attack if he was cast this turn.)*  

−9: Exile Gideon, the Oathsworn and each creature your opponents control.


* A non-Gideon creature is a creature that isn't also a Gideon planeswalker. For example, Gideon's Company is a non-Gideon creature.
* Any attacking Gideon creatures won't get a +1/+1 counter, but as long as two or more attacking creatures aren't Gideons, those attacking creatures each get a +1/+1 counter.
* Gideon's first loyalty ability doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types.
* If Gideon becomes a creature the same turn he enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any of his T abilities (if he gains any).
* Gideon's first loyalty ability causes him to become a creature with the creature type Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: planeswalker is only a type (not a creature type), and Soldier is just a creature type (not a planeswalker type).
* If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon after his first loyalty ability has resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he's also a creature, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.
* If Gideon has 9 loyalty as you activate his last ability, he'll be put into your graveyard and won't be exiled.

Gideon's Battle Cry *(Planeswalker Deck only)*  

2WW  

Sorcery  

Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control. You may search your library and/or graveyard for a card named Gideon, the Oathsworn, reveal it, and put it into your hand. If you search your library this way, shuffle it.


* You may cast Gideon's Battle Cry while you control no creatures. You'll still search for Gideon.

Gideon's Company *(Planeswalker Deck only)*  

3W  

Creature — Human Soldier  

3/3  

Whenever you gain life, put two +1/+1 counters on Gideon's Company.  

3W: Put a loyalty counter on target Gideon planeswalker.


* The ability of Gideon's Company triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from [Ajani's Welcome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Welcome) or 2 life from Battlefield Promotion.
* If Gideon's Company is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive counters from its ability in time to save it.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Gideon's Company's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of Gideon's Company triggers only once.
* Putting a loyalty counter on a Gideon planeswalker doesn't cause any of its activated abilities to become activated.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.

![Gideon's Sacrifice](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_eUhj6Gm6eZ.png)


Gideon's Sacrifice  

W  

Instant  

Choose a creature or planeswalker you control. All damage that would be dealt this turn to you and permanents you control is dealt to the chosen permanent instead *(if it's still on the battlefield)*.


* Gideon's Sacrifice has no effect on damage already dealt earlier in the turn.
* If you control no creatures or planeswalkers as Gideon's Sacrifice resolves, nothing happens. The damage redirection effect won't be able to be applied to any damage events.
* If the chosen creature or planeswalker isn't on the battlefield or isn't a creature or planeswalker at the time damage would be dealt, the damage won't be redirected.
* More damage can be redirected to the chosen creature than it has toughness or to the chosen planeswalker than it has loyalty, as long as that damage is all dealt at once (like combat damage is) or is all dealt while a single spell or ability is resolving.
* Gideon's Sacrifice doesn't change the source of the damage or whether the damage is combat damage.
* If you cast more than one Gideon's Sacrifice in one turn, all damage that would be dealt at once to you and/or permanents you control is dealt to one of the chosen permanents of your choice. It's not dealt to all of them, and you can't split the damage between them. The next time damage would be dealt to you, you may choose a different one of those permanents to be dealt that damage.

![Gideon's Triumph](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_XwT4rtYGDw.png)


Gideon's Triumph  

1W  

Instant  

Target opponent sacrifices a creature that attacked or blocked this turn. If you control a Gideon planeswalker, that player sacrifices two of those creatures instead.


* Gideon's Triumph can be cast before combat damage has been dealt. In this case, it can be cast before or after blockers have been chosen.
* Gideon's Triumph can be cast after combat damage has been dealt. In this case, the target player chooses one or two creatures that attacked or blocked this turn and have survived combat damage.
* A creature that was put onto the battlefield attacking didn't attack, so it can't be sacrificed.
* A creature that attacked and was removed from combat (such as by [Spires of Orazca](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spires+of+Orazca)) still attacked, so it can be sacrificed.
* Gideon's Triumph targets the player, not the creature or creatures to be sacrificed. A creature with hexproof may be sacrificed this way.

When Goblin Assault Team dies, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control.

When God-Eternal Bontu enters the battlefield, sacrifice any number of other permanents, then draw that many cards.  

When God-Eternal Bontu dies or is put into exile from the battlefield, you may put it into its owner's library third from the top.


* As Bontu's first triggered ability resolves, you may choose to sacrifice zero other permanents.
* If any abilities trigger as you sacrifice other permanents, those abilities won't be put onto the stack until after you've drawn cards.
* If a second God-Eternal Bontu enters the battlefield under your control, you'll put one into your graveyard before you can sacrifice it to the new Bontu's triggered ability.

God-Eternal Kefnet  

2UU  

Legendary Creature — Zombie God  

4/5  

Flying  

You may reveal the first card you draw each turn as you draw it. Whenever you reveal an instant or sorcery card this way, copy that card and you may cast the copy. That copy costs 2 less to cast.  

When God-Eternal Kefnet dies or is put into exile from the battlefield, you may put it into its owner's library third from the top.


* It's important to reveal the first card you draw each turn (or choose not to reveal it) before it is mixed with the other cards in your hand. You look at the card as you draw it before choosing whether to reveal it.
* You don't have to reveal a drawn card if you don't wish to copy it at that time.
* If you reveal a card this way, it remains revealed until Kefnet's triggered ability finishes resolving.
* You can reveal and copy an instant or sorcery card this way on any turn, not just your own, if it's the first card you've drawn that turn.
* Multiple card draws are always treated as a sequence of individual card draws. For example, if you haven't drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you'll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and copied with Kefnet's ability.
* If an effect puts a card into your hand without using the word "draw," the card wasn't drawn.
* You can cast the copy only as Kefnet's triggered ability resolves. If you don't want to cast it at that time (or you can't cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the copy ceases to exist. You can't cast it later.
* You can cast the copy during the resolution of the triggered ability if it's a sorcery, no matter whose turn it is or which phase it is.
* If the card leaves your hand before Kefnet's triggered ability resolves, you'll copy it using its last known information.
* The copy is created in and cast from your hand.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Kefnet's ability). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* If you somehow control more than one God-Eternal Kefnet (perhaps because one is a Spark Double), you may reveal a card you draw for any number of their abilities. One at a time, each will copy the card if it's an instant or sorcery, and you may cast each of them. Each copy resolves before you cast the next, and each copy's cost is reduced by only 2.

Double strike  

Whenever you cast a creature spell, create a 4/4 black Zombie Warrior creature token with vigilance.  

When God-Eternal Oketra dies or is put into exile from the battlefield, you may put it into its owner's library third from the top.


* Oketra's first triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* In the Commander format, a commander's color identity isn't affected by color words (such as black) appearing in its text. If God-Eternal Oketra is your commander, your deck can't contain black mana symbols.

Deathtouch  

When God-Eternal Rhonas enters the battlefield, double the power of each other creature you control until end of turn. Those creatures gain vigilance until end of turn.  

When God-Eternal Rhonas dies or is put into exile from the battlefield, you may put it into its owner's library third from the top.


* Rhonas's first triggered ability affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't have their power doubled or gain vigilance.
* If an effect instructs you to "double" a creature's power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is its power as that effect begins to apply.

God-Pharaoh's Statue  

6  

Legendary Artifact  

Spells your opponents cast cost 2 more to cast.  

At the beginning of your end step, each opponent loses 1 life.


* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases (such as that of God-Pharaoh's Statue's first ability), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, the last ability of God-Pharaoh's Statue causes the opposing team to lose 2 life.

Heartfire deals 4 damage to any target.


* You must sacrifice exactly one creature or planeswalker to cast this spell; you can't cast it without sacrificing one, and you can't sacrifice additional permanents.
* Players can respond to Heartfire only after it's been cast and all its costs have been paid. No one can try to destroy the permanent you sacrificed to stop you from casting this spell.

Legendary Planeswalker — Huatli  

7  

Each creature you control assigns combat damage equal to its toughness rather than its power.  

−3: You gain life equal to the greatest toughness among creatures you control.


* Huatli's first ability doesn't actually change any creature's power. It changes only the amount of combat damage it assigns. All other rules and effects that check power or toughness use the real values. For example, Domri's Ambush won't cause a creature to deal damage equal to its toughness.
* The greatest toughness among creatures you control is determined only as Huatli's loyalty ability begins to resolve.

Ilharg, the Raze-Boar

Legendary Creature — Boar God  

6/6  

Trample  

Whenever Ilharg, the Raze-Boar attacks, you may put a creature card from your hand onto the battlefield tapped and attacking. Return that creature to your hand at the beginning of the next end step.  

When Ilharg, the Raze-Boar dies or is put into exile from the battlefield, you may put it into its owner's library third from the top.


* You choose which player or planeswalker the new creature is attacking. It doesn't have to be attacking the same player or planeswalker that Ilharg is attacking.
* Although the new creature is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for the purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example, such as those of Trusted Pegasus and Makeshift Battalion).
* If the new creature leaves the battlefield before the end step, most likely because it died in combat, that card remains in its current zone. It won't return to your hand.
* If the new creature has an ability that triggers at the beginning of the end step, that ability will trigger and resolve even if the creature is returned to your hand during the end step before that ability resolves.

* Invade the City is still on the stack while you count your instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard. It doesn't count itself.
* If there are no instant or sorcery cards in your graveyard, you'll amass 0. If you don't control an Army, you'll create a 0/0 black Zombie Army creature token that will die after Invade the City has finished resolving.
* The number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard is counted only as Invade the City resolves.
* A split card that's both an instant and a sorcery is counted only once for Invade the City.

Whenever you draw your second card each turn, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control.

* Jace's first ability can trigger only once each turn. It doesn't matter whether Jace was on the battlefield when the first card was drawn.
* If an effect instructs you to draw multiple cards, Jace's first ability triggers after you draw whichever is the second one for the turn (if any). You choose a target for the ability after you've drawn all of the cards.
* If a spell or ability causes you to put cards into your hand without specifically using the word "draw," it's not a card drawn.
* Once Jace's last ability has resolved, its effect applies even if Jace has left the battlefield.

4  

If you would draw a card while your library has no cards in it, you win the game instead.  

+1: Target player puts the top two cards of their library into their graveyard. Draw a card.  

−8: Draw seven cards. Then if your library has no cards in it, you win the game.


* If for some reason you can't win the game (because your opponent controls [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel), for example), you won't lose for having tried to draw a card from a library with no cards in it. The draw was still replaced.
* If two or more players control Jace, Wielder of Mysteries and each player is instructed to draw a number of cards, first the player whose turn it is draws that many cards. If this causes that player to win the game instead, the game is immediately over. If the game isn't over yet, repeat this process for each other player in turn order.
* If the target player is an illegal target when Jace's first loyalty ability tries to resolve, it doesn't resolve. You won't draw a card.
* Follow the instructions in the order listed on Jace's first loyalty ability: if you target yourself, you'll put the top two cards of your library into your graveyard and then draw a card.
* If your library has fewer than seven cards in it while resolving Jace's last ability, and Jace has already left the battlefield, you'll draw as many cards as you can and then win the game before state-based actions would cause you to lose the game for trying to draw from an empty library.

5  

If another red source you control would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals that much damage plus 1 to that permanent or player instead.  

−2: Jaya, Venerated Firemage deals 2 damage to any target.


* Jaya's first ability doesn't cause Jaya to deal damage; it affects the amount of damage dealt by the original red source.
* If another effect modifies how much damage your red source would deal, including preventing some of it, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses an order in which to apply those effects. If all of the damage is prevented, Jaya's effect no longer applies.
* If damage dealt by a source you control is being divided or assigned among multiple permanents an opponent controls or among an opponent and one or more permanents they control simultaneously, divide the original amount before adding 1. For example, if you attack with a 5/5 red creature with trample and your opponent blocks with a 2/2 creature, you can assign 2 damage to the blocker and 3 damage to the defending player. These amounts are then modified to 3 and 4, respectively.

Activated abilities of artifacts your opponents control can't be activated.  

+1: Until your next turn, up to one target noncreature artifact becomes an artifact creature with power and toughness each equal to its converted mana cost.  

−2: You may choose an artifact card you own from outside the game or in exile, reveal that card, and put it into your hand.


* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text, such as equip. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected by Karn.
* Karn's first ability affects only artifacts on the battlefield. Activated abilities that work in other zones can still be activated.
* A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its T abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
* If a permanent has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* Karn's last ability can't get a face-down card in exile, even if you know it's an artifact card.
* In a casual game, a card you choose from outside the game comes from your personal collection. In a tournament event, a card you choose from outside the game must come from your sideboard. You may look at your sideboard at any time.

Spells your opponents cast that target a creature or planeswalker you control cost 2 more to cast.  

−2: Create a 2/2 blue Wizard creature token. Draw a card, then discard a card.


* To determine the total cost of an opponent's spell that targets a creature or planeswalker you control, start with the mana cost or alternative cost that player is paying, add any cost increases (such as that of Kasmina's effect), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* Spells that target more than one creature and/or planeswalker you control cost only 2 more to cast.
* You can't do anything in between drawing a card and discarding a card, including casting the card you drew.

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

Enchanted creature loses all abilities and has base power and toughness 1/1.


* Kasmina's Transmutation overwrites all previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after Kasmina's Transmutation becomes attached to a creature will overwrite this effect.
* Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Bleeding Edge, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness.
* If the affected creature gains an ability after Kasmina's Transmutation becomes attached to it, it will keep that ability.

Your opponents and permanents your opponents control with hexproof can be the targets of spells and abilities you control as though they didn't have hexproof.  

−3: Exile target creature.


* If a spell or ability you control targets an opponent with hexproof or an opponent's permanent with hexproof, and Kaya leaves the battlefield while that spell or ability is on the stack, that player or permanent becomes an illegal target for that spell or ability. This includes Kaya's own loyalty ability.

Enchant creature or planeswalker you control  

When enchanted permanent dies or is put into exile, return that card to the battlefield under your control.


* If another player gains control of the enchanted permanent, Kaya's Ghostform will be put into your graveyard.
* Kaya's Ghostform can enchant a token, but its last ability won't return the token to the battlefield.
* Kaya's Ghostform is put into your graveyard once the enchanted permanent leaves the battlefield. It doesn't return to the battlefield with that permanent.
* If an effect exiles the enchanted permanent and immediately returns it to the battlefield, the last ability of Kaya's Ghostform triggers but will have no effect. If an effect exiles the enchanted permanent and would return it to the battlefield at a later time, Kaya's Ghostform will return that card to the battlefield and it won't be returned later.
* If the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard or exile but leaves that zone before the last ability of Kaya's Ghostform resolves, that card stays in its new zone, even if that zone is also a graveyard or exile. You don't return it to the battlefield.
* If Kaya's Ghostform and the enchanted permanent are both put into graveyards and/or exiled at the same time, the enchanted permanent will be returned to the battlefield.
* If Kaya's Ghostform enchants a permanent you control but don't own, that permanent will return to the battlefield under your control when it dies or is exiled. In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any creatures you control from Kaya's Ghostform's effect are exiled.

Static abilities that raise or lower a creature's power are taken into account, as well as any +1/+1 counters the creature enters with. However, you can't have a creature with power 3 or less enter the battlefield, raise its power with a spell, an activated ability, or a triggered ability, and have Kiora's ability trigger.
* If the entering creature's power changes to 3 or less after it has entered the battlefield, you'll still draw a card.

Whenever Krenko, Tin Street Kingpin attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on it, then create a number of 1/1 red Goblin creature tokens equal to Krenko's power.


* If Krenko leaves the battlefield after its ability has triggered but before it resolves, you don't put a +1/+1 counter on it, but you do use its power as it last existed before it left the battlefield to determine how many Goblin tokens to create.
* The tokens created by Krenko's triggered ability aren't attacking. Because all attackers are chosen at once, a token created this way can't attack, even if it gains haste.

Static abilities that raise (or lower) a creature's power are taken into account. However, you can't have a creature with power 3 or less enter the battlefield, raise its power with a spell, an activated ability, or a triggered ability, and have Kronch Wrangler's ability trigger.
* If the entering creature's power changes to 3 or less after it has entered the battlefield, you'll still put a +1/+1 counter on Kronch Wrangler.
* If Kronch Wrangler's power is raised to 4 or greater as it enters the battlefield, it will cause its own ability to trigger.

* If you create a Zombie Army token when Lazotep Plating instructs you to amass 1, that token will gain hexproof until end of turn.
* You amass 1 and grant hexproof all while Lazotep Plating is resolving. Nothing can happen between the two, and no player may choose to take actions.

Whenever a creature you control dies, draw a card.  

+1: Create a 2/2 black Zombie creature token.  

−4: Each player sacrifices two creatures.  

−9: Each opponent chooses a permanent they control of each permanent type and sacrifices the rest.


* If Liliana dies at the same time as one or more creatures you control, her first ability triggers for each of those creatures.
* If Liliana somehow becomes a creature and dies, her first ability will trigger.
* As Liliana's second loyalty ability resolves, first the player whose turn it is chooses two creatures they control, then each other player in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Then all the chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time. If any player can choose only one creature, that player does so.
* As Liliana's last ability resolves, the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's somehow an opponent's turn, that opponent) makes all of their choices for it, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Then all the unchosen permanents are sacrificed at the same time.
* The permanent types are artifact, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker. Supertypes, like legendary, aren't permanent types.
* While making choices for Liliana's last ability, if a permanent has more than one permanent type, it can count for any of them. For example, you could choose an artifact creature as the artifact you're sparing, another creature as the creature, and an enchantment creature as the enchantment. Similarly, you could choose an enchantment creature as both the creature and the enchantment that you're sparing, even if you control another creature and/or another enchantment.

* As Liliana's Triumph resolves, the opponent whose turn it is (or, if it's your turn, the next opponent in turn order) chooses a creature to sacrifice, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Then all the chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time. Then, if you control a Liliana planeswalker, in the same order, each opponent chooses a card in their hand without revealing it, and those cards are discarded at the same time.

Menace  

When Massacre Girl enters the battlefield, each other creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn. Whenever a creature dies this turn, each creature other than Massacre Girl gets -1/-1 until end of turn.


* Massacre Girl's enters-the-battlefield triggered ability and its delayed triggered ability each affect only creatures on the battlefield at the time that those abilities resolve. Creatures that enter the battlefield or become creatures later in the turn won't get -1/-1 unless the delayed triggered ability triggers and resolves again later.
* Once Massacre Girl's enters-the-battlefield ability has triggered, it doesn't matter whether Massacre Girl remains on the battlefield. The delayed triggered ability will be created as the enters-the-battlefield ability resolves.
* Creatures that die while Massacre Girl's triggered ability is still on the stack won't cause its delayed triggered ability to trigger since that delayed triggered ability hasn't been created yet.
* A creature with 0 toughness doesn't die immediately. Rather, the creature dies the next time a player would receive priority. This means that any creatures whose toughness becomes 0 as Massacre Girl's enters-the-battlefield ability resolves will remain on the battlefield until just after the delayed triggered ability has been created.
* If more than one creature dies at once, Massacre Girl's delayed triggered ability triggers that many times.

Whenever a player sacrifices a permanent, Mayhem Devil deals 1 damage to any target.


* You control Mayhem Devil's triggered ability and choose the target, no matter who sacrificed the permanent.
* If a permanent is sacrificed to pay a cost of a spell or ability, Mayhem Devil's ability will resolve before that spell or ability. Conversely, if a permanent is sacrificed during the resolution of a spell or ability, that spell or ability will finish resolving before Mayhem Devil's ability is put onto the stack.
* Mayhem Devil itself doesn't allow any player to sacrifice any permanents. Its ability triggers whenever a player sacrifices a permanent because some other spell, ability, or cost instructed the player to do so.
* If you sacrifice Mayhem Devil, its ability triggers.
* A legendary permanent that is put into a graveyard because of the "legend rule" isn't sacrificed.

* Mizzium Tank's triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.

Mobilized District  

Land  

T: Add C.  

4: Mobilized District becomes a 3/3 Citizen creature with vigilance until end of turn. It's still a land. This ability costs 1 less to activate for each legendary creature and planeswalker you control.


* If you control four or more legendary permanents that are creatures and/or planeswalkers, the last ability of Mobilized District costs no mana to activate. A legendary planeswalker that's also a creature reduces this cost by only 1.
* If Mobilized District becomes a creature the same turn it enters the battlefield, you can't attack with it or activate its mana ability.
* An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature (for example, if it was the target of Awakening of Vitu-Ghazi), this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness will continue to apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. For example, if Mobilized District has been made a 0/0 creature with nine +1/+1 counters on it, activating its last ability will turn it into a 12/12 Citizen creature that's still a land.

Narset, Parter of Veils  

1UU  

Legendary Planeswalker — Narset  

5  

Each opponent can't draw more than one card each turn.  

−2: Look at the top four cards of your library. You may reveal a noncreature, nonland card from among them and put it into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.


* Your opponents can each draw a maximum of one card each on each player's turn. Subsequent card draws during that turn are ignored.
* If an opponent hasn't drawn any cards in a turn and a spell or ability instructs that player to draw multiple cards, that player will draw one card. However, if the instruction to draw multiple cards is optional (for example, "You may draw two cards"), the player can't choose to draw one card this way; the player will draw no cards.
* Narset will "see" cards drawn by opponents earlier in the turn she entered the battlefield, although Narset can't affect cards drawn before she entered the battlefield. For example, if an opponent draws two cards, then Narset enters the battlefield, that opponent can't draw more cards that turn, but the two drawn cards are unaffected.
* Replacement effects (such as that of [Underrealm Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underrealm+Lich) or the first ability of Jace, Wielder of Mysteries) can't be used to replace draws that Narset disallows. However, if an opponent's first draw is replaced (by [Underrealm Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underrealm+Lich)'s ability, for example), that draw didn't happen and Narset won't stop the next draw (which may also be replaced by [Underrealm Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underrealm+Lich)'s ability).

Narset's Reversal  

UU  

Instant  

Copy target instant or sorcery spell, then return it to its owner's hand. You may choose new targets for the copy.


* Narset's Reversal can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
* The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
* If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Finale of Promise does), the copy will have the same value of X.
* If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can). The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
* The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
* If you copy a spell, you control the copy. Narset's Reversal and the copy resolve before the original spell would have resolved.
* If a spell is returned to its owner's hand, it's removed from the stack and thus will not resolve. The spell isn't countered; it just no longer exists. This works against a spell that can't be countered.
* If a copy of a spell is returned to its owner's hand, it's moved there, then it will cease to exist as a state-based action.

Whenever Neheb, Dreadhorde Champion deals combat damage to a player or planeswalker, you may discard any number of cards. If you do, draw that many cards and add that much R. Until end of turn, you don't lose this mana as steps and phases end.

As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature.  

Search your library for a creature card with converted mana cost equal to 1 plus the sacrificed creature's converted mana cost, put that card onto the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on it, then shuffle your library.


* You must sacrifice exactly one creature to cast this spell; you can't cast it without sacrificing one, and you can't sacrifice additional creatures.
* Players can respond to Neoform only after it's been cast and all its costs have been paid. No one can try to destroy the creature you sacrificed to stop you from casting this spell.
* If a creature or a creature card in your library has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* Tokens that aren't a copy of something else don't have a mana cost. Anything without a mana cost normally has a converted mana cost of 0.
* A creature put onto the battlefield this way enters the battlefield with one +1/+1 counter if it would otherwise enter with no +1/+1 counters.

Enchanted land has "T: Add two mana of any one color."

Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God has all loyalty abilities of all other planeswalkers on the battlefield.  

+1: You draw a card. Each opponent exiles a card from their hand or a permanent they control.  

−3: Destroy target creature or planeswalker.  

−8: Each opponent who doesn't control a legendary creature or planeswalker loses the game.


* Nicol Bolas doesn't remove loyalty abilities from the other planeswalkers.
* Nicol Bolas doesn't gain any static or triggered abilities of other planeswalkers or any activated abilities they may have that aren't loyalty abilities.
* While Nicol Bolas may end up with an astonishing number of loyalty abilities, you can still activate only one loyalty ability of Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God each turn.
* If a loyalty ability of a planeswalker references the card it's printed on by name, treat Nicol Bolas's instance of that ability as though it referenced Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God by name instead. For instance, if Nahiri, Storm of Stone is on the battlefield, Nicol Bolas deals the damage if you activate the ability he gained from her.
* If an ability of a planeswalker exiles cards and another loyalty ability of that planeswalker references the exiled cards, those abilities are linked. If Nicol Bolas gains both abilities, the instances he has are similarly linked. Cards exiled by any other abilities Nicol Bolas has (such as his own first loyalty ability) won't be seen by those linked abilities.
* If any abilities trigger as you draw a card while resolving Nicol Bolas's first loyalty ability, those abilities don't resolve until after your opponents have exiled a card or permanent.
* After you draw a card as Nicol Bolas's first loyalty ability resolves, the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's somehow an opponent's turn, that opponent) chooses a permanent they control or chooses a card in hand without revealing that card. Then each other opponent in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Finally, all of the chosen cards are exiled simultaneously.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, if one player on a team loses the game, the entire team loses the game, even if the other player controls a legendary creature or planeswalker.

* If the top ten cards of your library don't contain all ten color pairs, you choose as many cards as you can and put those cards into your hand.

![No Escape](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_12EuqbZg6i.png)


No Escape  

2U  

Instant  

Counter target creature or planeswalker spell. If that spell is countered this way, exile it instead of putting it into its owner's graveyard.  

Scry 1.


* A creature or planeswalker spell that can't be countered is a legal target for No Escape. The spell won't be countered when No Escape resolves, but you'll still scry 1.

![Oath of Kaya](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_xcHvxzG9sb.png)


Oath of Kaya  

1WB  

Legendary Enchantment  

When Oath of Kaya enters the battlefield, it deals 3 damage to any target and you gain 3 life.  

Whenever an opponent attacks a planeswalker you control with one or more creatures, Oath of Kaya deals 2 damage to that player and you gain 2 life.


* If the target is an illegal target by the time the first ability of Oath of Kaya tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. You won't gain 3 life.
* If an opponent attacks more than one planeswalker you control, the last ability of Oath of Kaya triggers once for each of those attacked planeswalkers.

Ob Nixilis, the Hate-Twisted  

3BB  

Legendary Planeswalker — Nixilis  

5  

Whenever an opponent draws a card, Ob Nixilis, the Hate-Twisted deals 1 damage to that player.  

−2: Destroy target creature. Its controller draws two cards.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Ob Nixilis's last ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. No player draws two cards. If the target is legal but not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), its controller does draw two cards.
* If Ob Nixilis leaves the battlefield before his last ability resolves, most likely because he only had 2 loyalty when you activated the ability, his first ability won't exist to trigger when the creature's controller draws two cards.



---

![Ob Nixilis's Cruelty](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_pcsDEZxTvX.png)


Ob Nixilis's Cruelty  

2B  

Instant  

Target creature gets -5/-5 until end of turn. If that creature would die this turn, exile it instead.


* The replacement effect from Ob Nixilis's Cruelty will exile the target creature if it would die this turn for any reason, not just immediately after Ob Nixilis's Cruelty resolves.

Parhelion II  

6WW  

Legendary Artifact — Vehicle  

5/5  

Flying, first strike, vigilance  

Whenever Parhelion II attacks, create two 4/4 white Angel creature tokens with flying and vigilance that are attacking.  

Crew 4 *(Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 4 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.)*


* You choose which players or planeswalkers the two tokens are attacking. They don't have to be attacking the same player or planeswalker that Parhelion II is attacking, and they can each be attacking different players and/or planeswalkers.
* Although the tokens are attacking, they were never declared as attacking creatures (for the purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).

![Planewide Celebration](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_f6wWdZTic2.png)


Planewide Celebration  

5GG  

Sorcery  

Choose four. You may choose the same mode more than once.  

• Create a 2/2 Citizen creature token that's all colors.  

• Return target permanent card from your graveyard to your hand.  

• Proliferate.  

• You gain 4 life.


* No matter which combination of modes you choose, you always follow the instructions of Planewide Celebration in the order they are written. If a mode is chosen more than once, you perform that mode's instruction that many times sequentially.
* A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
* If the second mode is chosen at least once, and every target permanent card is an illegal target by the time Planewide Celebration tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. None of the other chosen modes happen. If only some of the targets are illegal targets but at least one is still legal, you still do as much as you can and the illegal targets aren't affected.

When Pollenbright Druid enters the battlefield, choose one —  

• Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.  

• Proliferate. *(Choose any number of permanents and/or players, then give each another counter of each kind already there.)*


* You may choose Pollenbright Druid as the target of its own ability.

![Price of Betrayal](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_YslLhdO4Ij.png)


Price of Betrayal  

B  

Sorcery  

Remove up to five counters from target artifact, creature, planeswalker, or opponent.


* Price of Betrayal has only one target. You may remove different kinds of counters from that one target, and you may also remove multiples of the same kind of counter from that one target.
* Players don't normally have counters, but some cards in other sets say that a player "gets" a counter of a certain kind. Notably, emblems aren't counters.



---

![Prison Realm](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_YmHLvEqHJ3.png)


Prison Realm  

2W  

Enchantment  

When Prison Realm enters the battlefield, exile target creature or planeswalker an opponent controls until Prison Realm leaves the battlefield.  

When Prison Realm enters the battlefield, scry 1.


* You'll still scry 1 even if Prison Realm's first ability has no legal target or if that target becomes an illegal target before the ability resolves.
* If Prison Realm leaves the battlefield before its first triggered ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist. When the card returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the card that was exiled.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.

Raging Kronch  

2R  

Creature — Beast  

4/3  

Raging Kronch can't attack alone.


* Raging Kronch can be declared as an attacker only if another creature is declared as an attacker at the same time. Once it's attacking, removing the other creature won't cause Raging Kronch to stop attacking.
* If you control more than one creature that can't attack alone, they can attack together, even if no other creatures attack.
* Although Raging Kronch can't attack alone, other attacking creatures don't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, Raging Kronch could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls.
* If a creature that can't attack alone also must attack if able, its controller must attack with it and another creature if able.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Raging Kronch can attack along with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control attack.

![Ral, Storm Conduit](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_UbJSypNdKY.png)


Ral, Storm Conduit  

2UR  

Legendary Planeswalker — Ral  

4  

Whenever you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell, Ral, Storm Conduit deals 1 damage to target opponent or planeswalker.  

+2: Scry 1.  

−2: When you cast your next instant or sorcery spell this turn, copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.


* If an effect copies a spell multiple times, as Finale of Promise may, Ral's first ability triggers that many times.
* If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy created by Ral's last ability will have the same mode or modes. You can't choose different ones.
* If the spell that's copied has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can). The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy created by Ral's last ability. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.
* The copies that Ral's last ability creates are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.

![Ral's Outburst](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_lGB9H3WTjX.png)


Ral's Outburst  

2UR  

Instant  

Ral's Outburst deals 3 damage to any target. Look at the top two cards of your library. Put one of them into your hand and the other into your graveyard.


* If the target permanent or player is an illegal target by the time Ral's Outburst tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You won't look at the top two cards of your library.
* If you have only one card in your library, you put it into your hand. You won't lose the game if your library's empty until you try to draw from the empty library.

![Rally of Wings](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_8SztsgAB6J.png)


Rally of Wings  

1W  

Instant  

Untap all creatures you control. Creatures you control with flying get +2/+2 until end of turn.

Rescuer Sphinx  

2UU  

Creature — Sphinx  

3/2  

Flying  

As Rescuer Sphinx enters the battlefield, you may return a nonland permanent you control to its owner's hand. If you do, Rescuer Sphinx enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it.


* You choose whether to return a nonland permanent and which one to return for Rescuer Sphinx's ability while it's entering the battlefield. No player may take actions between the time you choose which permanent to return and the time Rescuer Sphinx is on the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter.
* If the returned permanent had an ability that would otherwise have triggered when Rescuer Sphinx enters the battlefield (such as that of Kronch Wrangler), that ability won't trigger.
* If Rescuer Sphinx somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another permanent, you can't return that permanent. You may choose only permanents that are already on the battlefield.

Rising Populace  

2W  

Creature — Human  

2/2  

Whenever another creature or planeswalker you control dies, put a +1/+1 counter on Rising Populace.


* If a planeswalker that's also a creature dies, Rising Populace's ability triggers only once.
* If Rising Populace and another creature you control die simultaneously (perhaps because they were both dealt lethal damage in combat), Rising Populace won't be on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves. It can't be saved by the +1/+1 counter that would have been put on it.

![Roalesk, Apex Hybrid](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_YSkVCgAxCC.png)


Roalesk, Apex Hybrid  

2GGU  

Legendary Creature — Human Mutant  

4/5  

Flying, trample  

When Roalesk, Apex Hybrid enters the battlefield, put two +1/+1 counters on another target creature you control.  

When Roalesk dies, proliferate, then proliferate again. *(Choose any number of permanents and/or players, then give each another counter of each kind already there. Then do it again.)*


* You proliferate twice all while Roalesk's last ability is resolving. Nothing can happen between the two proliferations, and no player may choose to take actions.
* If Roalesk would die and it's your commander in the Commander variant, you may put it into the command zone instead. However, if you save Roalesk this way, it doesn't die and you won't proliferate.



---

![Role Reversal](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_kBLOkwjOrt.png)


Role Reversal  

UUR  

Sorcery  

Exchange control of two target permanents that share a permanent type.


* If one of the target permanents is an illegal target when Role Reversal resolves, the exchange won't happen.
* Role Reversal's effect lasts indefinitely. It doesn't wear off during the cleanup step, and it doesn't expire if the permanents stop sharing a permanent type after Role Reversal has resolved.
* You don't have to control either target permanent.
* If the same player controls both permanents when Role Reversal resolves, nothing happens.
* Gaining control of a permanent doesn't cause you to gain control of any Auras or Equipment attached to it.
* The permanent types are artifact, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker. Supertypes, like legendary, aren't permanent types. For example, you can't exchange control of a legendary creature with a legendary planeswalker.

Rubblebelt Rioters  

1RG  

Creature — Human Berserker  

0/4  

Haste  

Whenever Rubblebelt Rioters attacks, it gets +X/+0 until end of turn, where X is the greatest power among creatures you control.


* The value of X is determined only as the triggered ability of Rubblebelt Rioters resolves. Once that happens, the value of X won't change later in the turn even if the greatest power among creatures you control changes.
* If Rubblebelt Rioters is the only creature you control as its triggered ability resolves, X is equal to its own power. Unless another effect or a +1/+1 counter has raised its power above 0, this won't have any effect.

![Saheeli, Sublime Artificer](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_TUWNjjmWXD.png)


Saheeli, Sublime Artificer  

1u/ru/r  

Legendary Planeswalker — Saheeli  

5  

Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, create a 1/1 colorless Servo artifact creature token.  

−2: Target artifact you control becomes a copy of another target artifact or creature you control until end of turn, except it's an artifact in addition to its other types.


* Saheeli's first ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* Saheeli's loyalty ability causes the target artifact to copy the printed values of the target permanent, plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on that permanent or effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Notably, it won't copy effects that made the target permanent become a creature.
* The target artifact is an artifact in addition to whatever types the second target has, and this exception is copiable. If something else copies the artifact later in the turn, that copy also will be an artifact.
* If the target artifact copies a permanent that's copying something else, it will become whatever the target is copying.
* If an effect begins to apply to the target artifact before it becomes a copy of another permanent, that effect will continue to apply.
* If the target artifact becomes a creature the same turn it enters the battlefield, you can't attack with it or use any of its T abilities unless it has haste.
* If the target artifact isn't an Equipment and becomes a copy of an Equipment, it'll become unattached when it becomes a non-Equipment artifact again.
* If the target artifact is an Equipment attached to a creature and it becomes a copy of a non-Equipment permanent, it becomes unattached. If it becomes a copy of an Equipment, it remains attached.

Creatures you control have haste.  

−1: Target creature gets +2/+1 and gains haste until end of turn. Scry 1.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Samut's loyalty ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. You won't scry 1.

Sarkhan the Masterless  

3RR  

Legendary Planeswalker — Sarkhan  

5  

Whenever a creature attacks you or a planeswalker you control, each Dragon you control deals 1 damage to that creature.  

+1: Until end of turn, each planeswalker you control becomes a 4/4 red Dragon creature and gains flying.  

−3: Create a 4/4 red Dragon creature token with flying.


* A planeswalker that becomes a creature due to Sarkhan's first loyalty ability can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began.
* Once Sarkhan's first loyalty ability has resolved, each planeswalker you control (including Sarkhan) is no longer a planeswalker for the rest of the turn. They don't lose any loyalty counters or abilities, and you can still activate their loyalty abilities if you haven't done so yet this turn. They don't lose loyalty if they're dealt damage while they're not planeswalkers.

![Single Combat](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_5YaEcvd4cd.png)


Single Combat  

3WW  

Sorcery  

Each player chooses a creature or planeswalker they control, then sacrifices the rest. Players can't cast creature or planeswalker spells until the end of your next turn.


* As Single Combat resolves, first the player whose turn it is chooses a creature or planeswalker they control, then each other player in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Then each unchosen creature and planeswalker is sacrificed at the same time.
* In a multiplayer game, if you leave the game after Single Combat resolves but before your next turn begins, its effect lasts until your next turn would have begun. It neither expires immediately nor lasts indefinitely.

Sorin, Vengeful Bloodlord  

2WB  

Legendary Planeswalker — Sorin  

4  

As long as it's your turn, creatures and planeswalkers you control have lifelink.  

+2: Sorin, Vengeful Bloodlord deals 1 damage to target player or planeswalker.  

−X: Return target creature card with converted mana cost X from your graveyard to the battlefield. That creature is a Vampire in addition to its other types.


* Multiple instances of lifelink on the same creature or planeswalker are redundant.
* If Sorin leaves the battlefield after you've activated his first loyalty ability during your turn but before it resolves, you'll still gain 1 life as that ability deals damage.
* If a card in a graveyard has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.

![Spark Double](https://media.wizards.com/2019/war/en_pzoxpeu1jg.png)


Spark Double  

3U  

Creature — Illusion  

0/0  

You may have Spark Double enter the battlefield as a copy of a creature or planeswalker you control, except it enters with an additional +1/+1 counter on it if it's a creature, it enters with an additional loyalty counter on it if it's a planeswalker, and it isn't legendary if that permanent is legendary.


* Spark Double copies exactly what was printed on the original permanent (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it as any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* Spark Double isn't legendary if it copies a legendary permanent, and this exception is copiable. If something else copies Spark Double later, that copy also won't be legendary. If you control two or more permanents with the same name but only one is legendary, the "legend rule" doesn't apply.
* If the copied permanent has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If the chosen permanent is copying something else (for example, if the chosen permanent is another Spark Double), then Spark Double enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen permanent copied.
* If the chosen permanent is a token, Spark Double copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. Spark Double doesn't become a token in this case.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when Spark Double enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
* If it copies a planeswalker, Spark Double enters with the appropriate number of loyalty counters as printed on the card plus one. If it copies a creature, Spark Double enters with a +1/+1 counter on it, plus any counters that will be put on it from abilities it copied and other abilities of other objects.
* If the copied permanent is affected by a type-changing effect, Spark Double may enter the battlefield with different permanent types than the copied permanent currently has. Use the characteristics of Spark Double as it enters the battlefield, not of the copied permanent, to determine whether it enters with an additional counter on it. Notably, if Spark Double copies a Gideon planeswalker that's a creature because its loyalty ability caused it to become a planeswalker creature, Spark Double enters as a noncreature planeswalker and doesn't get a +1/+1 counter. On the other hand, if Spark Double copies Gideon Blackblade during your turn, Spark Double enters as a planeswalker creature and gets both kinds of counters.
* If Spark Double somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another permanent, it can't become a copy of that permanent. You may choose only a creature or planeswalker that's already on the battlefield.

Spark Harvest  

B  

Sorcery  

As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature or pay 3B.  

Destroy target creature or planeswalker.


* You must sacrifice exactly one creature or pay an extra 3B to cast this spell; you can't cast it without paying one of those costs, and you can't pay either multiple times. Players can respond to Spark Harvest only after it's been cast and all its costs have been paid. No one can try to destroy the creature you sacrificed to stop you from casting this spell or to make it cost more mana.

Until end of turn, creatures you control get +2/+2 and gain "Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player or planeswalker, destroy target artifact or enchantment defending player controls."


* Storm the Citadel affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +2/+2 or gain the triggered ability.
* If a creature is attacking a planeswalker, the controller of the planeswalker is the defending player.

5/4  

Trample  

Whenever Storrev, Devkarin Lich deals combat damage to a player or planeswalker, return to your hand target creature or planeswalker card in your graveyard that wasn't put there this combat.


* If Storrev dies due to combat damage dealt at the same time that it deals combat damage to a player or planeswalker, its ability still triggers.
* Storrev's triggered ability can't target any card that was put into your graveyard during this combat phase. This includes creatures and planeswalkers that died from combat damage, creatures and planeswalkers that died for any other reason, and cards that were put there from any other zone.

Tamiyo, Collector of Tales  

2GU  

Legendary Planeswalker — Tamiyo  

5  

Spells and abilities your opponents control can't cause you to discard cards or sacrifice permanents.  

+1: Choose a nonland card name, then reveal the top four cards of your library. Put all cards with the chosen name from among them into your hand and the rest into your graveyard.  

−3: Return target card from your graveyard to your hand.


* As a spell or ability an opponent controls resolves, if it would force you to sacrifice a permanent or discard a card, you just don't. That part of the effect does nothing. If that spell or ability gives you the option to sacrifice a permanent or to discard a card, you can't take that option.
* If a spell or ability an opponent controls states that something happens unless you sacrifice a permanent (as [Mogis, God of Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%2C+God+of+Slaughter) does) or discard a card (as [Painful Quandary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Quandary) does), you can't choose to sacrifice or discard. On the other hand, if a spell or ability an opponent controls instructs you to sacrifice a permanent unless you perform an action (as [Killing Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Killing+Wave) does) or discard a card unless you perform an action, you can choose whether or not to perform the action. If you don't perform the action, nothing happens, since the spell or ability can't cause you to sacrifice any permanents or discard cards.
* Tamiyo's ability affects sacrifices, but not any other ways permanents can leave the battlefield. It won't stop a creature from dying due to lethal damage or having 0 toughness, and it won't stop a permanent from being put into its owner's graveyard due to the "legend rule." None of these are sacrifices; they're the result of game rules.
* If a spell or ability your opponent controls reduces your maximum hand size, Tamiyo's first ability won't stop you from discarding cards when the game rules cause you to discard during your cleanup step.
* If Tamiyo has 3 loyalty, you can't activate her last ability to return her to your hand. She won't be in your graveyard while you're choosing targets for the ability.

Teferi, Time Raveler  

1WU  

Legendary Planeswalker — Teferi  

4  

Each opponent can cast spells only any time they could cast a sorcery.  

+1: Until your next turn, you may cast sorcery spells as though they had flash.  

−3: Return up to one target artifact, creature, or enchantment to its owner's hand. Draw a card.


* If an effect allows opponents to cast spells any time they could cast an instant (for example, if your opponent also controls a Teferi, Time Raveler and activates his +1 loyalty ability), the restriction of Teferi's first ability takes precedence over that permission.
* You may activate Teferi's last ability without choosing any target. You'll just draw a card. However, if you do choose a target and the target permanent is an illegal target by the time Teferi's last ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. You don't draw a card.

Teferi's Time Twist  

1U  

Instant  

Exile target permanent you control. Return that card to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step. If it enters the battlefield as a creature, it enters with an additional +1/+1 counter on it.


* Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist. Once the exiled permanent returns, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was.
* The permanent returns untapped unless another effect causes it to enter the battlefield tapped.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
* To determine whether the entering permanent is entering as a creature, consider any effects that will modify that permanent's characteristics once it's on the battlefield, including that permanent's own abilities that affect only itself and effects from other objects.
* A creature returned to the battlefield this way enters the battlefield with one +1/+1 counter if it would otherwise enter with no +1/+1 counters.

Haste  

Whenever you cast a spell that targets Tenth District Legionnaire, put a +1/+1 counter on Tenth District Legionnaire, then scry 1.


* Tenth District Legionnaire's ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* You scry 1 even if you can't put a +1/+1 counter on Tenth District Legionnaire, most likely because it has left the battlefield.

Tezzeret, Master of the Bridge *(Buy-a-Box promotional card)*  

4UB  

Legendary Planeswalker — Tezzeret  

5  

Creature and planeswalker spells you cast have affinity for artifacts.  

+2: Tezzeret, Master of the Bridge deals X damage to each opponent, where X is the number of artifacts you control. You gain X life.  

−3: Return target artifact card from your graveyard to your hand.  

−8: Exile the top ten cards of your library. Put all artifact cards from among them onto the battlefield.


* Affinity for artifacts means "This spell costs 1 less for each artifact you control."
* Tezzeret himself doesn't have affinity for artifacts.
* Affinity doesn't change the spell's converted mana cost. It changes only how much mana you pay to cast the spell.
* Affinity can reduce only generic mana in a spell's cost. It can't reduce color requirements.
* The cost reduction is set before you pay any of the spell's costs. Specifically, you could lock in a discount for an artifact you control and then sacrifice that artifact to activate a mana ability.
* If there are any additional costs or cost increases that would apply to a spell with affinity, apply those before applying any cost reductions.
* If a spell has multiple instances of affinity, each applies.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Tezzeret's first loyalty ability causes the opposing team to lose twice X life and you gain X life.

Flying  

Whenever you cast your second spell each turn, put a +1/+1 counter on Thunder Drake.


* Thunder Drake's ability can trigger only once each turn. The ability will resolve before the second spell resolves. It doesn't matter if the first spell you cast that turn has resolved, was countered, or is still on the stack.
* Thunder Drake must be on the battlefield in order for the ability to function. Notably, the ability won't trigger if Thunder Drake is the second spell you cast in a turn.

Your opponents can't gain life.  

−2: Create a 1/1 red Devil creature token with "When this creature dies, it deals 1 damage to any target."


* Spells and abilities that cause opponents to gain life still resolve while Tibalt is on the battlefield. No opponent will gain life, but any other effects of that spell or ability will happen.
* If an effect says to set an opponent's life total to a number that's higher than their current life total while Tibalt is on the battlefield, the player's life total doesn't change.

2GGW  

Legendary Creature — Elf Scout  

3/3  

When Tolsimir, Friend to Wolves enters the battlefield, create Voja, Friend to Elves, a legendary 3/3 green and white Wolf creature token.  

Whenever a Wolf enters the battlefield under your control, you gain 3 life and that creature fights up to one target creature you don't control.


* If Tolsimir is still on the battlefield when its enters-the-battlefield trigger resolves, its last ability will trigger as Voja is created.
* You may put Tolsimir's last ability onto the stack without choosing any target. You'll just gain 3 life. However, if you do choose a target and the target permanent is an illegal target by the time Tolsimir's last ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. You don't gain 3 life and no creature deals or is dealt damage.
* If the Wolf that entered the battlefield is no longer on the battlefield as Tolsimir's last ability resolves, no creature deals or is dealt damage, but you do gain 3 life.
* Tolsimir, Friend to Wolves has a different name than [Tolsimir Wolfblood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolsimir+Wolfblood) (from the *Ravnica: City of Guilds* set), and Voja, Friend to Elves has a different name than Voja, the token created by [Tolsimir Wolfblood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolsimir+Wolfblood). Since the "legend rule" only cares about exact English names, this means you may control all four of these creatures at the same time.

Lands on the battlefield and land cards in graveyards can't be the targets of spells or abilities your opponents control.  

Your opponents can't play land cards from graveyards.


* Tomik's middle ability is similar to hexproof, but effects that interact with hexproof don't count these lands or land cards as having hexproof.
* Players can't normally play a land card from a graveyard. If a player finds a way to do so, Tomik's last ability takes precedence over that permission.

* If the target permanent is an illegal target when Topple the Statue tries to resolve, it doesn't resolve. You won't draw a card. If the target is legal but neither tapped nor destroyed, you do draw a card.

4/3  

Reach  

When Turret Ogre enters the battlefield, if you control another creature with power 4 or greater, Turret Ogre deals 2 damage to each opponent.


* If you don't control another creature with power 4 or greater immediately after Turret Ogre enters the battlefield, its ability doesn't trigger, even if you can raise a creature's power right away. If you control no other creature with power 4 or greater as the ability resolves, nothing happens. These don't have to be the same creature, though.
* Turret Ogre's ability doesn't deal more than 2 damage if you control more than one other creature with power 4 or greater.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Turret Ogre's ability causes the opposing team to lose 4 life.

Ugin, the Ineffable  

6  

Legendary Planeswalker — Ugin  

4  

Colorless spells you cast cost 2 less to cast.  

+1: Exile the top card of your library face down and look at it. Create a 2/2 colorless Spirit creature token. When that token leaves the battlefield, put the exiled card into your hand.  

−3: Destroy target permanent that's one or more colors.


* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Ugin). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* A colorless spell whose mana cost is 2 or 1 will cost 0 to cast.
* Once you look at the exiled face-down card once, you may look at it again any time you wish. If another player gains control of the Spirit token, that player can't look at the exiled card.
* If the Spirit leaves the battlefield for any reason, you'll put the exiled card into your hand, even if Ugin left the battlefield before that happened.
* If you've activated Ugin's ability multiple times, you must keep track of which exiled card belongs to each Spirit token.
* If an effect such as that of [Doubling Season](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) causes Ugin to create two Spirit tokens, you still only exile one card from your library. You'll put that card into your hand the first time that either of the tokens leaves the battlefield.
* A land normally has no color, even if it can produce one or more colors of mana.

Ugin's Conjurant  

X  

Creature — Spirit Monk  

0/0  

Ugin's Conjurant enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it.  

If damage would be dealt to Ugin's Conjurant while it has a +1/+1 counter on it, prevent that damage and remove that many +1/+1 counters from Ugin's Conjurant.


* To cast Ugin's Conjurant, first choose the value for X you'd like, then apply any cost increases, then any cost reductions. The number of counters it enters with may be different than the amount of mana you pay if an effect (such as that of Ugin, the Ineffable) causes that you pay an amount of mana other than X.
* If Ugin's Conjurant would be dealt more damage than it has counters, you remove all of the +1/+1 counters it has on it and prevent all of that damage. If another effect is raising its toughness, it will survive until the next time it's dealt lethal damage.

You may cast creature spells as though they had flash.  

+1: Until your next turn, up to one target creature gains vigilance and reach.  

−2: Look at the top three cards of your library. Exile one face down and put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order. For as long as it remains exiled, you may look at that card and you may cast it if it's a creature card.


* While resolving Vivien's last ability, you must exile one of the three cards, even if none of them are creature cards. You may look at the exiled card at any time, even if it's not a creature card.
* You must follow any applicable timing permissions and restrictions if you cast the exiled card. This means that if Vivien leaves the battlefield, you can't cast the creature spell as though it had flash unless another effect allows you to do so.
* Once you cast the creature card, it leaves exile. You can't cast it again if that card becomes exiled again.
