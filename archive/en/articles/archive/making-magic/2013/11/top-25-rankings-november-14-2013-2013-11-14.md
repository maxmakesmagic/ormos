It's time for our weekly look at the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings, and this time the focus was on the European [Grand Prix in Valencia](/en/events/coverage/smarty-marti-vanquishes-valencia), where *Theros* Limited was the format battleground. Three of the Top 25 were in attendance—[World Champion](/en/events/coverage/woc13) Shahar Shenhar of Israel; Hall of Famer Raphaël Lévy; and Martin Juza, looking for his nineteenth Grand Prix Top 8. 

 Of the three, Lévy had by far the best performance, with a real rollercoaster ride through the weekend. Following a Round 8 loss to Piero Lombardi of Italy, Lévy had to win his final round just to make it into Day Two. Once there, he could leave Sealed behind and focus on *Theros* Draft. Like with any top-tier pro, letting Lévy into Day Two, even on the minimum 7–2 record, makes him a danger all the way, and he relentlessly marched his way up the standings with win after win, his 5–0 record leaving him a win-and-in for the Top 8... 

 ...and that's where the run ended. In heartbreaking fashion, it was a [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) from Aleksejs Laizans that took the Latvian into the Top 8, and for the fourth time in his career, Lévy was left in 9th place. 

 With Shenhar and Juza failing to make Day Two, what impact has Valencia had on our overall Top 25? Shenhar remains at No. 4, just over a point behind his World Championship finals opponent Reid Duke. There's a gap to the Japanese pair of Shuhei Nakamura and Yuuya Watanabe, and Lévy's reward for coming oh so close is to nudge further into the Top 20, ahead of [Pro Tour Amsterdam](/en/events/coverage/ptamd10) champion Paul Rietzl. 

 Next up is the capital idea of a Legacy Grand Prix in Washington DC, where we can expect many of the stars to come out to play. Join us next week for another look inside the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings.
