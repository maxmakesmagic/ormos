MTG Arena Announcements, August 11, 2021

Release and Downtime Change: August 24
======================================


The planned August release that includes the backend update and *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* has been shifted forward to August 24. You can find [details on the new backend update and release plan](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/release-changes-jumpstart-historic-horizons-and-mtg-arena-updates-2021-08-09) in Jay Parker's article.


This will push the planned release of *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* to August 26, but it will be available through October 14 to give you plenty of time to enjoy it and the forthcoming [*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* set release on September 16](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/first-look-innistrad-midnight-hunt-and-innistrad-crimson-vow-2021-08-05).


Historic Brawl
==============


The August 12 opening date of Historic Brawl remains unchanged by the adjusted release and downtime mentioned above; however, from August 12–24 it will be in the form of a Historic Brawl Festival.


No entry will be required for this event, and players will receive 3,000 XP for their first win!


August 2021 Ranked "Doubling Season"
====================================


Originally, we planned to split the [August 2021 Ranked Season](https://magic.gg/events/ranked-play-season) into two to accommodate the backend update and downtime. With that date moving forward to August 24, we won't need to divide the season into two.


So, the August 2021 Ranked Season will now continue uninterrupted through August 24 and players' ranks will be reset at the end as normal. The September 2021 Ranked Season will be slightly longer, beginning on August 24 and running through September 30.


To honor the rewards announced when the season was to be split, the August season is now a "doubling season" that will feature double gold and pack rewards, plus twice as many Card Styles at each rank! [Jump down to the Events Schedule](#events) to see what those will look like.


Also, to honor the invitation structure, both the first 500 players to reach Mythic rank, as well as the approximate Top 500 Mythic-rank players, as of 7:00 a.m. PT on August 10 in both Constructed and Limited will be extended Qualifier Weekend invitations. You can [read more about these additional invitations in our updated announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/release-changes-jumpstart-historic-horizons-and-mtg-arena-updates-2021-08-09#update).


Extra Premier Drafts and First Entry = No Entry Fee!
====================================================


We know everyone has been excited to get into *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons*, so to tide you over until it starts on August 26, we're adding extra Premier Drafts—with a bonus:


* August 10–15: *Amonkhet Remastered*
* August 15–20: *Kaladesh Remastered*
* August 20–26: *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths*

Plus, your first entry into each Premier Draft has no entry fee!


Midweek *Magic*: Momir Aug 10–12
================================


Midweek *Magic*'s format this week is Momir. You'll receive a 60-card deck of all basic lands and an emblem you can click once each turn that allows you to pay {X} and discard a card to create a token copy of a random creature card with converted mana cost X. There's more strategy than you may think in this format, so give it a try!


[Midweek *Magic* events](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-adventures-forgotten-realms-2021-07-02#midweekmagic) run weekly from Tuesday at 8 a.m. PT through Thursday at 8 a.m. PT with a different format each week. There is no entry fee, and you can earn two rare individual card rewards—just like FNM at Home.
