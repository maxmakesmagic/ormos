**Sideboard Staff:** Care to explain?


**Raffaele Lo Moro:** Let's say that I've noticed that after round 2, I was still "cold" since I didn't have the time to feel the tournament. Anyway, this is my fifth GP in which I start with the maximum amount of byes and I only reached day 2 once. It's all the byes' fault.


**Sideboard Staff:** What about your future? What do you think you will accomplish in the next season?


**Raffaele Lo Moro:** I still don't know.. I'm concentrating on my Nationals; I'm scared that if I don't test enough, I'll finish playing one of the horrible german decks that came in the Top 8.


**Sideboard Staff:** Who will win the Italian nationals this year?


**Raffaele Lo Moro:** I don't know, but surely someone from Rome.


**Sideboard Staff:** Thanks Raffaele, hope to see you at the European Championships.
