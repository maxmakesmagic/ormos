**In the 10 years since Magic was introduced, about 8,500 cards have been published. Of those, which is your favorite, and why?**

|  |  |  |
| **Richard Garfield:** "[Wyluli Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wyluli+Wolf). ”Wyluli” is an anagram for my then-fiancé's name (Lily Wu)." | **Randy Buehler:** "[Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence), of course. I can count at least 25,000 reasons why it's my favorite." | **Ken'ichi Fujita:** "Everyone should know by now what my favorite is—[Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)." |

**What deck or card have you played against this weekend that you weren't expecting to see?**




|  |  |  |

|  |  |  |
| **Masashi Ooiso:** "I've only played against White-Red decks so far. What really surprised me is that [Goblin Sharpshooter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sharpshooter) is a lot better than we thought it was in playtesting." | **Kazuya Hirabayashi:** "I've actually surprised myself. I have no idea why I ended up playing a GRB deck." | **Kouichirou Maki:** "I never thought I would see [Ark of Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ark+of+Blight) in Constructed, much less lose a game to it." |

**What card was your MVP today? (asked of the Day 1 undefeated players)**

|  |  |  |
| **Lee Jun-Young:** "[Jareth, Leonine Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jareth%2C+Leonine+Titan)." | **Eiji Nomura:** "I played a lot of red decks, and the [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) in my sideboard saved me lots of times." | **Osamu Fujita:** "[Temple of the False God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+the+False+God) and [Eternal Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Dragon), because they smoothed out my mana." |

**This is the first major Onslaught Block Constructed event to use *Scourge*. Which card from that set do you think will have the greatest impact on OnBC?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Tsuyoshi Fujita:** "Well, everyone knows that [Eternal Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Dragon) is strong. But I actually think that [Temple of the False God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+the+False+God) is going to have the biggest impact on the environment." | **Masashiro Kuroda:** "[Eternal Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Dragon)." | **Akira Asahara:** "Probably [Eternal Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Dragon), but you can't ignore [Siege-Gang Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander) either." |

**This year is the 10th Anniversary of **Magic**. A lot of things have happened during the last decade as the game has grown. What is your most significant **Magic** memory?**

| **Katsuhiro Mori:** "I don't know. I'm starting over from scratch." | **Jin Okamoto:** "Being this year's [Worlds](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=sideboard/events/worlds03) Finalist." | **Itaru Ishida:** "I've done a lot of things, but what stands out most for me is winning [Itaru Ishida: "I've done a lot of things, but what stands out most for me is winning Grand Prix Kobe."](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2001-grand-prix-kobe-2015-09-02)Grand Prix Kobe." |
