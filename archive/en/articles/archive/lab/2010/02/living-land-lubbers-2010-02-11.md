Welcome back to the Lab! Today it is my task to deliver some kooky ideas concerning lands that attack. I like this theme week not only because it means I can fully dive into *Worldwake*, but because it's flexible enough to apply to the attacking lands of sets past.

I also want to try to use lands in proactive ways other than attacking. *Worldwake* itself has shown us that you can not only animate lands ([Crusher Zendikon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusher+Zendikon)) but make them indestructible ([Terra Eternal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terra+Eternal)), play them more quickly ([Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore)), get a lot of them in your hand ([Treasure Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Hunt)), and more. As long as lands are involved in the process, I'll be content.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl77_crusherSplash.jpg)  
This leads me to my first deck, which began as another riff on [Selective Memory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selective+Memory), my second *Worldwake* [preview card](/en/articles/archive/lab/selective-memory-2010-01-28). The goals of this deck are to stick a [Countryside Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Countryside+Crusher) on the table and follow it up with a [Selective Memory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selective+Memory). Choose to exile every nonland card in your library except for your two copies of [Soul's Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul%27s+Fire). The Crusher will have a mammoth upkeep, milling dozens of lands until it reaches one of the [Soul's Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul%27s+Fire)s. If you can't roast your opponent with one, the next one definitely should suffice. I think this deck applies for today because it uses lands as fuel for a large attacker—and besides, it has [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) in it!

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mountain)

















  
The early goal is to find a [Countryside Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Countryside+Crusher) as soon as possible. [Drift of Phantasms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drift+of+Phantasms) can find one. There's also a mini-Giant subtheme in the deck, in case you can't get the combo running. [Giant Harbinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Harbinger) can find the Crusher, [Thundercloud Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundercloud+Shaman) can sweep the board of weenies, and [Crush Underfoot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crush+Underfoot) acts as the creature-only version of [Soul's Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul%27s+Fire), which should come in handy if you just want to kill a blocker and swing with a big Crusher. [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox)es speed up the deck, while [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)s typically slow down your opponent. This deck is pretty fun if you like lots of lands and big Giants (which should apply to most people!)

### Animation Revelation

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl77_emergenceSplash.jpg)  
Okay, back to the old- and new-fashioned idea of animating your lands. In a couple of great emails, reader Aaron made me aware of a fascinating combination: [Terra Eternal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terra+Eternal) and [Natural Emergence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Emergence). As Aaron said, "the possibility of controlling an army of 2/2 first striking, indestructible beat machines is too enticing to pass up." The reason Aaron went with a tricky gating enchantment to pull this off instead of the easier [Nature's Revolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Revolt) was because [Natural Emergence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Emergence) is the only one that has a "you control" clause. Sharing said 2/2 first striking indestructible beat machines is not exactly in the plan.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Terra Eternal | Natural Emergence |

For an early green or red enchantment, Aaron used various cheap ones that help with the mana flow. [Exploration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exploration) and [Burgeoning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burgeoning) accomplish the same general thing, [Trace of Abundance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trace+of+Abundance) can accelerate into a turn-three Emergence, and [Sterling Grove](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sterling+Grove) finds key enchantments and protects them as well. To this list I'm going to add [Rites of Flourishing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Flourishing). It acts as both an [Exploration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exploration) and a [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine), letting you draw into your pieces quicker.



|  |  |

| Sterling Grove | Rites of Flourishing |

Aaron also thought to use the new, appropriately colored dual creature-lands in his Naya-aligned concoction. [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) is just as beastly as it looks, and that level of beastliness only skyrockets with a [Terra Eternal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terra+Eternal) on the battlefield. Even if you run into a big blocker, you'll still survive with that extra +1/+1 counter. Eventually, your Ravine will be big enough to wipe anything out. And post–[Natural Emergence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Emergence), it's +1/+1 counters will make it an extra big beat machine.

Aaron also used [Earth Surge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earth+Surge), which in my mind earns big style points. Now *all* of your lands are extra big beat machines. Even without the [Natural Emergence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Emergence), a surprise [Vivify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivify) on an untapped land can result in a 5/5 land creature ambushing your opponent's [Rhox Brute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+Brute). It gets even crazier with [Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Fist+of+Krosa), who is perfect here as a singleton.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Earth Surge | Chain Reaction |

Another *Worldwake* card that seems useful here is [Chain Reaction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Reaction). Dubbed the "red [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod)" by, well, myself, [Chain Reaction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Reaction) likes seeing a ton of creatures on the board. The [Natural Emergence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Emergence) + [Terra Eternal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terra+Eternal) combo ups the total creature count, possibly letting a [Chain Reaction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Reaction) fry everything on the board while leaving your indestructible army unhindered.

Here's a slightly modified version of Aaron's deck, which was very well put together.

I went with [Wild Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Growth) instead of [Trace of Abundance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trace+of+Abundance). Accelerating into a turn-three [Terra Eternal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terra+Eternal) is important, and a turn-three [Rites of Flourishing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Flourishing) is fun for everyone. [Mass Hysteria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Hysteria) seems like a neat enchantment to help [Natural Emergence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Emergence) get onto the battlefield, and it'll then give all your indestructible lands haste as well. Aaron's original list had [Vinelasher Kudzu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vinelasher+Kudzu), which is definitely a noteworthy card for any land-heavy deck.

### Limber Landfall

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl77_lifeLimbSplash.jpg)  
One of the most braintwisting cards of all time is, in my opinion, [Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb). It's clearly a Johnny's delight, offering interactions with Saprolings and [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s and all. Way back when, Chris Millar offered a [reader-fueled article](/en/articles/archive/breaking-mold-2007-02-21) filled with fun and kooky ways to use the *Planar Chaos* enchantment. One of my favorite decks in that article is the one that proactively uses no [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s, to prevent the possibility of sweepers. Of course, that deck used [Kavu Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Recluse) to destroy lands like crazy (you heard me).

The thing about [Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb) is that when you cause a Saproling to enter the battlefield, since it's also a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), it will trigger the landfall cards from *Zendikar* block. So for example, when you cast a [Scatter the Seeds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds), it'll trigger [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra), [Grazing Gladehart](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grazing+Gladehart), or [Avenger of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar)—thrice.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl77_times3.jpg)  
Speaking of [Avenger of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar), now there's a mythic rare land-related game-winner. This card caught my eye when it was [previewed](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/second-landfall-2010-01-22), and I'm glad to use it now. It gets even better alongside [Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb), since your Saprolings count as lands. I would use [Artificial Evolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificial+Evolution) to change "Plant" to "Saproling," but I don't want my brain to explode.

Multiple triggers from a [Turntimber Basilisk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turntimber+Basilisk) can often result in a [Plague Wind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Wind), since a simple [Scatter the Seeds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds) can force three creatures to block the deathtouching creature. The many Funguses from *Time Spiral* block can put Saproling [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s onto the battlefield at instant speed, opening up a window for the new "landfall instants," like [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell), [Searing Blaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze), and [Mysteries of the Deep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mysteries+of+the+Deep).

I tried to make the deck more about [Avenger of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar) than [Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb), since doing the latter is risky and can backfire unhappily. The Avenger, however, is just a fun green fatty to build around. For instance, it's the first Plant lord. Yeah, let that sink in a bit. Plant lord.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl77_plantLord.jpg)  
[Plant Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plant+Elemental) can sacrifice a Saproling if [Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb) is in play. [Wall of Blossoms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Blossoms) is a classic defender. [Snapping Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Creeper) and [Vinelasher Kudzu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vinelasher+Kudzu) are landfalling Plants, hitting both of our deck's core concepts. [Khalni Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden) offers a free 0/1 Plant token with your land.

As for ramping, [Khalni Heart Expedition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Heart+Expedition), [Search for Tomorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow), and [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow) (which has extra utility when you can sacrifice a blocking Saproling [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)) can do the job. [Terra Eternal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terra+Eternal), meanwhile, returns in this deck to protect our Saproling [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s from a devastating [Seismic Shudder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Shudder).

I wound up going with [Saproling Symbiosis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saproling+Symbiosis) instead of [Scatter the Seeds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds), as seen above. The *Invasion* sorcery is mentioned in Chris's article and is generally spectacular alongside [Life and Limb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+and+Limb).

### Balaclava

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl77_lavaclawSplash.jpg)  
Of the new *Worldwake* lands, my personal favorite one is [Lavaclaw Reaches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaclaw+Reaches). Red has always been my favorite color in **Magic**, and more often than not black is runner up, so it makes sense that I like the red/black one. What really draws me to it, though, is its firebreathing ability. Now, technically, it's not firebreathing on a technical level. Let's call it "Demonspining"—after [Demonspine Whip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonspine+Whip), of course.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl77_ceaselessAttacking.jpg)  
[Lavaclaw Reaches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaclaw+Reaches) also becomes an Elemental with an activated ability. And the way it's worded, you can use the Reaches to get a lot of mileage out of, say, [Ceaseless Searblades](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ceaseless+Searblades). Pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif) for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif), and you get a free +1+0 for the Searblades. Repeat and swing-a-ling. [Smokebraider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokebraider)s and [Soulbright Flamekin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulbright+Flamekin)s can help pump up the Reaches for attacking as well. 

The basic black Elementals round out this deck: [Shriekmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw), [Ashling, the Extinguisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashling%2C+the+Extinguisher) (joining her red twin), [Deepfire Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepfire+Elemental), and [Igneous Pouncer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Igneous+Pouncer). [Flamekin Harbinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamekin+Harbinger) can find all of them. [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map), meanwhile, can find [Lavaclaw Reaches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaclaw+Reaches).
