With six rounds in the books, the metagame of the top tables is starting to shape up. I checked in on the top tables during round seven to see what's been winning. Let's take a look! 



 Blue/Red Delver continues to be a dominant force here in New Jersey. The deck applies quick pressure with [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), and [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) before controlling the game with countermagic and burn spells while keeping its hand filled with [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise). There are significantly more copies of the deck than any other archetype at the top tables.
