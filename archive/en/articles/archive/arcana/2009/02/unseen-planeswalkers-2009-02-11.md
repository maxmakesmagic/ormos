Iyou've opened a few *Shards of Alara* packs (and if you haven't, why not? It's fun!), you might have noticed this card:

Naturally, your first thought was "What? Play Network?! I want to be a part of that!" Well, [feel free](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/wpn/main). And with that out of the way, how about that [Chandra Nalaar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Nalaar) in the background? It was drawn by Richard Whitters. You might also have seen it on the half-decks that were made available through mysterious convention-related means last summer.

But the drawings are, in our opinions, *really, really cool*. And the half-decks didn't really use all of them. So here they are, in all their glory!
