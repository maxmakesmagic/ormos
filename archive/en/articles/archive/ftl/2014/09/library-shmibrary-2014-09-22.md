### FROM THE LAB

Mike Cannon signed on to write From the Lab at the end of 2012. An ardent casual player and lover of bizarre synergies, he'll be bringing you a selection of crazy combo decks every Monday.


September 22, 2014
 











 Hello, everyone! It's time for another exciting edition of From the Lab! *Khans of Tarkir* will be released later this week, but most folks have already had a chance to take the new cards for a spin at a local Prerelease event. Today I'll be exploring one of the clans I find most intriguing: the Sultai.



Delving Things Other Than Secrets
=================================



 The return of the delve mechanic (and I use the word *return* loosely, as it only appeared on [three cards in *Future Sight*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=[%22Future+Sight%22]&text=[delve])) is something many players have been anticipating for some time. It was at one time being considered for the returning mechanic in *Innistrad*, but despite being a graveyard-focused mechanic, it doesn't actually play well with a graveyard theme. Delve uses up the cards in your graveyard, so they won't be there when cards like [Runechanter's Pike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runechanter%27s+Pike) go looking.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=126151&type=card)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=126151)




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=136041&type=card)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=136041)








 The number of cards in your graveyard is a limited resource, and it's often difficult to determine how many more you'll end up with later. This can make knowing when to play a card with delve difficult if your deck has multiple copies. Since the amount by which you'll able to reduce the cost is unknown, delve cards are also very difficult to evaluate for power level. [Tombstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tombstalker) may not seem very effective as a 5/5 for eight mana, but it proved to be incredibly effective in decks that could support it.



All this got me thinking. What if I eliminated the unknown part of delve? Instead of having to guess at how many cards will be in my graveyard, I could make the answer always the same: All of them.



 As it happens, *Khans of Tarkir* has the perfect card to take advantage of this. If you have four black mana, [Empty the Pits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Pits) can create dozens of Zombie tokens at instant speed, ready to untap and kill your opponent almost immediately. There aren't many ways to get rid of an entire army of tokens at instant speed, so it should prove to be an effective way to win the game.

Books in a Graveyard
====================



 So there are a few things you need to make this combo happen. You need your library in your graveyard, you need [Empty the Pits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Pits) in your hand, and you need four black mana. Presumably, putting your library in your graveyard will require two cards, so we'll need at least three cards to pull this off. And likely an extra turn of setup time in order to untap and get enough black mana.




 Then an idea occurred to me. With the right setup, all of the other requirements could be handled from the graveyard after you put your library there. To do that, I'll turn to a classic combo. By using [Cephalid Illusionist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Illusionist) in combination with [Shuko](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shuko) or [Nomads en-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomads+en-Kor), you can put the top two cards of your library into your graveyard. After that it's just a matter of preparation.

First, the decklist, because you'll need to be able to follow along.

 Now bear with me, because this is going to get a bit complex. As you mill your entire library, the four [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)s should be put onto the battlefield. If you drew one it's no big deal, as the combo can work with as few as two. In addition, at some point you'll hit the deck's one [Blightsteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus). Just shuffle it back in and check to see if there are any cards you need still in your library. If there are, keep going until you can avoid the Colossus long enough to get them.






[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Narcomoeba)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blightsteel Colossus)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel Colossus)




 Now you should have a huge pile of cards in your graveyard and one Colossus, plus a few random cards, in your library. You should also have between two and four copies of [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) on the battlefield. Use those to pay the flashback cost on [Dread Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return), targeting [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness). [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) puts [Empty the Pits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Pits) into your hand, and [Bridge from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) triggers to put three Zombie tokens onto the battlefield. [Sacrifice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacrifice) those to cast another copy of [Dread Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return).




 Now you still have between three and five creatures on the battlefield, so use the flashback on another [Dread Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return) to bring back [Priest of Gix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Gix). That gives you three of the four black mana you need. If you have another black mana already, you can cast [Empty the Pits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Pits) now.






[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dread Return)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread Return)




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Priest of Gix)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest of Gix)




 However, if you had at least three [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)s to sacrifice and still have your [Cephalid Illusionist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Illusionist), you have enough creatures to cast the other two copies of [Dread Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return). [Sacrifice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacrifice) the Illusionist, [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), and [Priest of Gix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Gix) to get back [Empyrial Archangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empyrial+Archangel), which should make it easy to survive the turn until you can attack with your army of Zombies. You'll get another three Zombies due to [Bridge from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below), and you can use those to get back another [Priest of Gix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Gix) if you don't have an extra black mana lying around.




 Since the deck only contains one copy of most of these cards, there's still enough room for a bit of support. [Worldly Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldly+Tutor) can search for [Cephalid Illusionist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Illusionist) and [Nomads en-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomads+en-Kor), while [Impulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Impulse) and [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) can generally smooth out your draws and help you get the cards you need. [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) can also be used to get any necessary cards back into your library from your hand.




*Sic Semper Tyrannis*
======================



 One of my favorite cards in *Khans of Tarkir* is [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant). She's a relatively simple, cost-effective creature, but her effect is also quite interesting. Sidisi rewards you for putting creatures from your library into your graveyard by giving you free Zombie tokens. That certainly seems like something you can abuse.




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sidisi, Brood Tyrant)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi, Brood Tyrant)

The only problem is that your library is a limited resource. As soon as you run out of creatures in your library, you're done making Zombies.



 Or are you? Let's throw in one of the legendary Eldrazi, say, [Kozilek, Butcher of Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+Butcher+of+Truth). Whenever you put Kozilek into your graveyard from your library, you'll shuffle your entire graveyard back in. Now you can continue making Zombie tokens for as long as you can continue putting your library into your graveyard.




 I already showed off one way of infinitely milling yourself in the previous deck, but there's more than one way to toss out a few books. In this case, the key card is [Mesmeric Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Orb). The Orb is already a pretty powerful mill card by itself, often putting half a dozen cards into each player's graveyard every turn. However, if you combine it with a card that can tap and untap itself, such as [Basalt Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basalt+Monolith), you can continue milling cards as long as you like.






[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mesmeric Orb)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric Orb)




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Basalt Monolith)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basalt Monolith)




[Basalt Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basalt+Monolith) is far from the only option for its part of the combo. [Aphetto Alchemist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Alchemist) and [Seeker of Skybreak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+Skybreak) will work as well, although their summoning sickness could occasionally slow you down by a turn.




 Now you have a way to get a million Zombies on the battlefield, but having them sit there for a turn with summoning sickness doesn't seem ideal. To solve that I've thrown in a copy of [Anger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger). Use a [fetch land](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+[%22Land%22]&text=+[search]+[your]+[library]&set=|[%22Khans%20of%20Tarkir%22]|[%22Zendikar%22]) like [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) to grab [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) and your undead army can end the game right away.




[Sultai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Charm) can defend you from a wide variety of threats, or help you dig for the combo piece you need. It's not particularly efficient in any of its modes, but its ability to be relevant no matter the board state makes it incredibly useful.






[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Anger)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger)




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sultai Charm)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai Charm)




 I added one copy of [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) as a sort of safety valve. If you draw Kozilek, you can start the combo, then sacrifice a Zombie to cast it from your graveyard and get rid of the Eldrazi. Even if you draw both you can do the same thing from your hand for one mana, making it more foolproof than adding a second Kozilek. A few cards to search your library for the necessary pieces rounds out the deck.

 Second Chances
================



 At the end of my second preview article this month, I issued a [challenge](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ftl/unknown-2014-09-08) to you readers. Build a deck based on one of the five clans of Tarkir, either by using the accompanying color combination or by building a deck around one or more watermarked cards from that clan. You can even try a more esoteric method and try to portray the ideals of your clan rather than just its cards.



Frankly, the response so far has been underwhelming, to say the least. Therefore I'm leaving the contest open for one more week. Get those decks done and send them to me, and if yours strikes my fancy I'll show it off in a future article. Here's a quick rundown of the guidelines for those who missed them last time.



* All decks should be sent in to [mtgcannon@gmail.com](mailto:mtgcannon@gmail.com).
* Decks should be formatted with one card per line with just the numeric quantity and the name of the card. No "2x," etc. Do not separate cards by type.
* Please include a name that I can use in the article if your submission is chosen, as well as a description of the deck.
