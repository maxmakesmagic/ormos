Showcase Challenge Weekends
---------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend. These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and a future Championship invitation.


First up on Saturday, January 22, we have the Modern Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (16:00 UTC), and on Sunday, January 23, we have the Pioneer Showcase Challenge at 6 a.m. PT (14:00 UTC). Then next week on Saturday, January 29, we have the Vintage Showcase Challenge at 10 a.m. PT (18:00 UTC), and on Sunday, January 30, we finish things off with the Legacy Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (16:00). Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in April.
