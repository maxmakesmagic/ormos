Starting off 7-0 and locking up a spot in day 2, Ken Yukuhiro decided to bring an Esper deck to Grand Prix Kobe 2015. Compared to the many Esper players who made day 2, Ken took a different approach with his deck

#### This time you picked Esper colors, why did you decide on this deck?


Ken Yukuhiro:


I played a bunch of Abzan Aggro online. With Abzan Aggro I realized that games were decided based on whether you had the right amount of removal spells. It's really tough to have timely removal for [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) and [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker), making them ideal threats in this format.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Seeker+of+the+Way)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hangarback+Walker)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker)
#### Then why aren't you playing [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way)?


While [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) is a splendid card versus Abzan Aggro, when compared to [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker), there really isn't much difference. [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker), on the other hand, is great in other matchups.


#### How so?


Compared to [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way), [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) is a great topdeck. If you're mana flooded it's a great way to spend a bunch of mana. [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) is also a difficult card to play against—what do you do when it's played against you? [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) combos well with [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance) and is a great companion with [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar). It's for these reasons that I think [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) is better in this deck than [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) and why I played it.


#### What are your thoughts on other decks


Although we're in a predominately Abzan Aggro metagame, there are 5-6 other decks that are of around the same power. I don't think I have any terrible matchups and I think that's in part to having [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker). I also need to have [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor) against the Eldrazi Ramp Decks


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Monastery+Mentor)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor)
#### Is [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor) also a key card in your deck?


Against Eldrazi Ramp and Abzan Aggro it is. In matchups that go long, it's a card I can't win without. The truth is that I think whether I win is based on my play and that I can win or lose against anything. That's why I chose this deck.


#### Looking at your list you don't have many 4-ofs.


In a lot of cases 1 copy is all I need. I have 4 copies of the important cards—[Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy), [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker), and [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor)—and three copies of [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance), but after that I only have 1 or 2 copies of the other cards.


#### You also have [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar), right?


I only have 2 copies. Everyone has 4, but I don't think you need 4. I think it's really weak on the draw, but strong on the play, which is why I have a copy in my sideboard.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar)
#### You have a lot of 1-ofs in your sideboard as well.


Yup. I have 4 copies of [Arashin Cleric](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashin+Cleric) in order to slow down red decks. Most of the slots are metagame picks—if the metagame switches I could switch those spots. Because mono-red is only about 5% of the format, I can't give up those spots. If I did, I'd get run over by mono-red.
