A**rigger** is someone who deals with rigging—ropes, chains, tackle, or other gear for lifting heavy objects. A rigger might be an expert in ropes and pulley for the transport of ship cargo, a master of scaffolding and trusses for theater work, or someone charged with the important and detail-oriented job of packing parachutes.


[Steamflogger Boss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steamflogger+Boss) has introduced Rigger as a creature type in **Magic**. The Boss is the operator of a "steamflogger," a steam-powered artifact jalopy designed to "motivate" the pilot's fellow riggers. Note that the machine he pilots has two types of "motivator" appendages—a whip arm and a claw-like appendage. That is some good rigger motivation. But even more is going on in Warren Mahy's art—let's take a look.

The other goblin riggers around the Boss are hefting heavy objects. Note that their heads all have either an X or an O marked on them. The flavor text implies two classes of rigger workers, Xs and Os, that receive different form of motivational technique:



> *"Whip the Xs! Pinch the Os!*  
> *What we're building, no one knows!"*


Note also that the [Steamflogger Boss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steamflogger+Boss) himself appears to be an X—both by his head plating and by the X painted on his motivational machine. Do the riggers have a promotional scheme? Did the Boss work his way up through the hierarchy of X-riggery? Or is there some sort of revolving leadership schedule?


Or maybe this guy's actually in charge?
