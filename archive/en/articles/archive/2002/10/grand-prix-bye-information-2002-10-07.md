Grand Prix Bye Information
==========================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on October 7, 2002 










 Complete information about Grand Prix Byes can be found in the **Magic: The Gathering**[Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://archive.wizards.com/wpn/Document.aspx?x=Magic_The_Gathering_Premier_Event_Invitation_Policy)

Grand Prix Byes Award Criteria
 A player may be awarded byes for an individual-format Grand Prix based on one or more of the following criteria: * Winning a [Grand Prix Trial](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/trials).
* Having a sufficiently high number of [Planeswalker Points](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints) Seasonal Award Points.
* Having a specific [Pro Tour Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) level (Silver, Gold, or Platinum).
* Being a member of the [Pro Tour Hall of Fame](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/hof/welcome).

Grand Prix Bye Restrictions
 Players can be awarded one-, two-, or three-round byes for individual-format Grand Prix. Byes are not cumulative within a given Grand Prix or from one Grand Prix to another. Byes may not be passed down to other players for any reason and are not transferable. Byes may not be deferred from one Grand Prix to another and must be earned each time. Players that accumulate multiple byes to a Grand Prix are awarded only the bye for the greatest number of rounds. If a player is awarded a bye, he or she is considered to have earned 3 points in the Grand Prix for each of those rounds. Byes are not counted toward a player’s opponent’s match win percentage. Players with byes will usually have an advantage in tiebreakers over players that do not have byes.

Byes at Individual-format Grand Prix
 For each Individual-format Grand Prix, byes are awarded as listed below. All listed criteria are as of the date of the specific Grand Prix: **Third-Round Byes** 

* Players who have accumulated at least 1,500 Planeswalker Points in the *current* Planeswalker Points Seasonal Award Season.
* Players who have accumulated at least 1,500 Planeswalker Points in the *previous* Planeswalker Points Seasonal Award Season.
* Players with a Pro Tour Players Club level of Gold or Platinum.
* Members of the Pro Tour Hall of Fame.

**Second-Round Byes** 

* Winners of Grand Prix Trial tournaments designated to award byes to that Grand Prix.
* Players who have accumulated at least 750 Planeswalker Points in the *current* Planeswalker Points Seasonal Award Season.
* Players who have accumulated at least 750 Planeswalker Points in the *previous* Planeswalker Points Seasonal Award Season.
* Players with a Pro Tour Players Club level of Silver.

**First-Round Byes** 

* Players who have accumulated at least 400 Planeswalker Points in the *current* Planeswalker Points Seasonal Award Season.
* Players who have accumulated at least 400 Planeswalker Points in the *previous* Planeswalker Points Seasonal Award Season.

 Note: As of September 5, 2013, teams are not awarded byes in team-format Grand Prix.
