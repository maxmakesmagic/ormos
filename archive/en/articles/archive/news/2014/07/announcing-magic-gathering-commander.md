The *Magic: The Gathering* panel at San Diego Comic-Con this past weekend revealed quite a bit about our upcoming products. One exciting bit of news was the official announcement of the latest release for our *Magic: The Gathering—Commander* series with this year's *Magic: The Gathering—Commander* (2014 Edition).

For the first time ever, you can lead your forces with a Planeswalker commander in this exciting multiplayer *Magic* format. Dominate the battlefield with new combinations of strength and skill. Swarm opponents with mighty creatures and arm yourself with powerful artifacts. But fight wisely, for only one commander will prevail.


Also for the first time ever, Planeswalker commanders will headline five monocolored 100-card Commander decks. There will be 61 new cards legal in eternal formats (Vintage and Legacy) but not legal in Standard, Block Constructed, or Modern, with 15 new cards in each deck.
