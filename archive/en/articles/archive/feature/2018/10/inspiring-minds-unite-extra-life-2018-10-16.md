Wizards of the Coast is back for a seventh epic year of Extra Life!


The Extra Life organization brings gamers around the world together to compete in live eventsâ€”all while helping to heal kids in need. In 2018, we have a more ambitious goal than ever: bringing in $200,000 for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.


Luckily, we have the [D&D team](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=299039), the [*Magic* team](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=39726), and you!


The *Magic* team kicks off the fun, streaming from Friday, October 19 at 8 a.m. PT until 11:59 p.m. PT on Saturday, October 20. Tune in at [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic) for some sweet *MTG Arena* spellslinging action, then downtown Ravnica D&D, Brawl, some *Unstable* nonsense, Commander, and closing out with the greatest 3-hour variety hour of all time.


Getting involved with Extra Life has never been easier! You can [give to our cause](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donate.participant&ParticipantID=304718), [join our team](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=register.start&eventID=539&teamID=39726), or support an [individual campaign](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.teamParticipants&teamID=39726#teamTabs) for unbelievable giveaways. During the stream, we're running hourly auctions with breathtaking offerings like foil uncut sheets.


Plus, we've partnered with [MTG Pro Shop](http://extralifeshop.com/) to roll out *Magic* Extra Life swag. This year's gear is themed with our very own Niv-Mizzet mascot, and every penny of the proceeds goes to Extra Life. You can head there now to preorder shirts, playmats, pins, and stickers.

The D&D team will be streaming on the official Extra Life Game Day, Saturday, **November 3**, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. PT. Keep an eye out for participating streams at [twitch.tv/dnd](https://www.twitch.tv/dnd/) all week long, culminating at Game Hole Con 2018.
