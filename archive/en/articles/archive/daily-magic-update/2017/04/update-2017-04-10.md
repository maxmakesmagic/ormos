The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 10, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by a menagerie of preview cards.


Today's Previews
================


Every day until the full set is revealed on April 14, I'll be sharing all the non-DailyMTG previews you can find around the web in this space. Here are today's:


1. [Exclusive *Amonkhet* Preview—Vizier of the Menagerie!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX8C7iBeLXM) | The Mana Source | Wedge

It's like [Garruk's Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Horde) and [Oracle of Mul Daya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) got together and had a baby, but that baby came out with a Snake head.

Oketra, the white God, gets its debut in Italian. You can find a rough translation from, as usual, [a helpful Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/64ipuc/akh_oketra/dg2fdx3/). Further down the thread, you can also find Cat puns. Many, many Cat puns.


Oh, and while we're at it, the *Invocation* version of Oketra looks a little something like this.

The card, in English, is called Censor, and yes, it's a cycling [Force Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike). Honestly, that's something I never thought I'd see at two mana. But the day has come. Basically, if you're playing against me for the foreseeable future, I highly suggest keeping an extra mana open.


1. [*Amonkhet* Exclusive Preview!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34893_Amonkhet-Exclusive-Preview-.html) | StarCityGames.com | Split Second

It's not quite [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), but then, it probably doesn't need to be to be to get control mages salivating. Myself included. Sorry, wiping drool off the keyboard.


1. [Liliana's Mastery](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering.kr/posts/1393112054079910) | Korean *Magic: The Gathering* Facebook page

This is [an approximately correct translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/64hjp7/akh_new_korean_card_or_repeat/dg28avr/), and your opponent is going to be having an approximately rough time when it comes to fighting this enchantment, especially in a dedicated Zombie deck.


1. [The Command Zone](https://collected.company/category/the-command-zone/) | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai | **Coming Soon**

Shocker, this card is going to be playable in Commander. True story.

[Unburden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburden) yourself for just two mana and draw another card—or, better yet, [Unburden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburden) your opponent for just three mana. [Mind Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) hasn't looked this good since [Blightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning).

Oh, hey, "next Monday" is today! Check out the [First Strike podcast tonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai17Ufy_RMM) to catch *two* preview cards from *Amonkhet*.


Synergy of the Day
==================


1. Discarding for Fun and Profit

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bomat+Courier)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bomat+Courier) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bedlam+Reveler)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bedlam+Reveler)
![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_D2PjMt6hhU.png)![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_6Oog5GhkuJ.png)


[Bomat Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bomat+Courier) and [Bedlam Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bedlam+Reveler) are already strong cards that see some amount of Standard play (and, in Reveler's case, some amount of Modern play, even). But the benefit has always been on the "draw" side of the ability, with the discard part mostly as a cost. But what if you could make both sides work for you? What if discarding your hand meant pumping your Flameblade Adept sky-high? Or, possibly more frightening, what if it meant giving -1/-1 to each of your opponent's creatures for each card you formerly had in hand?


The three red cards could definitely form the backbone of an aggressive red deck, possibly paired up with madness cards like [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper). The Archfiend looks like it could go particularly well with [Bedlam Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bedlam+Reveler) in a more midrange or controlling black-red deck that utilizes a ton of spells to keep opponents in check.


Whichever direction you choose, the synergy is very real.
