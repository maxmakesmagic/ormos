### Game 1

Neither player had a spectacular start. Benjamin played first and made a second turn [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba), but with no relevant madness cards it only swung for one on turn three. Ruel made a [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) and [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)ed [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter).

![Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Compulsion)Caumes drew [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) on turn four and tried to madness it into play with the [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba). Antoine used his [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) once without finding another counter and it resolved. He compulsed again on turn four after Caumes summoned a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), then dropped his hand of four lands and a [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) on the table, as the Wurm and [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) would kill him on Benjamin's next turnBenjamin Caumes 1 – Antoine Ruel 0

Antoine brings in three [Persuasion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion) and three [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) to complement his four [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) and four [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)s in the main deck. Benjamin brings in [Envelop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop) and [Gigapede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigapede).

### Game 2

Caumes start was much better this game as he got a [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) for two [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla)s on turn 1. He didn't have a turn three play, so he pumped one of them and Antoine was ready with a [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother), and an [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) for the other.

Caumes' draw contained only land and [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic)s, so neither player cast a spell until Antoine's turn five, when he attempted a [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). He didn't play his land first, which meant that Caumes could [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic) it. After the game Antoine said "I wanted him to counter it so I could resolve [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate), but perhaps it wasn't right."

![Gigapede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gigapede)Ben used a second [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic) to keep his turn six [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) on the table when Antoine [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed it. It still died to Antoine's [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood), and Ruel tapped out for his [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate). This didn't work out too well though, as Benjamin immediately drew [Gigapede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigapede). Antoine only had [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s in hand, and took two hits from the [Gigapede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigapede) going to five.Caumes did him a big favor by playing [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), finally giving Ruel a target for his [Persuasion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion). Unfortunately this left Antoine with enough mana to counter a [Roar of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm). Ruel bought himself one more turn with [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) on Insects killing [Gigapede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigapede), but after chumping with the Looter for a turn, he didn't find any answer to the 6/6.

**Final Result:** Benjamin Caumes defeats Antoine Ruel 2 – 0

After the game Antoine talked a little about his Tog deck. It has an interesting combination of creature removal and card drawing. He only has eight creature kill, four [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) and four [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother), where a lot of people have nine. There isn't any spot kill in the sideboard as such (apart from [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise) which is not boarded in but left as a Wish target), but he does have three each of [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) and [Persuasion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion). He explained that he preferred [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) to things such as [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) and [Callous Oppressor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Callous+Oppressor). For card drawing he plays both [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and two [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate)s, with the fourth Deep in the sideboard to give him a better matchup against control. "I have played a lot of Tog, and this is the version I think is best."
