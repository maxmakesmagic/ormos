Kush Patel is only sixteen years old – though you certainly would not guess it by looking at him. A pretty big guy, Patel is a resident of Southboro, MA. He owes his exotic name to his parents, who are from India, though Patel was born in United States. 

Patel is not a pro player yet, though he did qualify for Team Pro Tour-New York. He and his teammates, all JSS players, chose not to attend the Pro Tour as it would disqualify them from being able to compete in future JSS events. Now that he is over sixteen, Patel can give a more serious consideration to trying to go pro. After he plays his last JSS event in Florida this weekend, that is.

Patel played a Psychatog variant very much geared toward beating the mirror. He's got Gainsays, Deep Analysis, and Chainer's Edict all main deck. "I like Psychatog. It is a solid deck, and it can beat the mirror and beat aggressive decks at the same time," Patel commented on his deck choice. 

TJ Collectibles is Patel's regular store, so he managed to keep the title home, succeeding Tom Guevin who won the first New England Challenge. He intends to play Psychatog in the JSS next weekend. "I am going to change some cards around," he confesses. "Take out main deck Gainsays and all."
