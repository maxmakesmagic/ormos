A little while back, Wizards of the Coast offered a promotion to encourage people to teach their friends to play **Magic**: the Guru program. Included as giveaways were five basic lands illustrated by [Terese Nielsen](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/feature/38). The lands -- called Guru lands -- show five stages of a "double eclipse."


The expansion symbol of the cards was someone wearing a mortarboard, stylized to look like an eye. The symbol was stamped in bronze.


Below is the full art for all five lands.
