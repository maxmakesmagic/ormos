Updates from the *Magic Online* Team
------------------------------------


More updates from the *Magic Online* team will be coming this Friday! Chris Kiritz's State of MTGO article and Allison Steele's *Ikoria: Magic Online* Edition will both be available Friday morning at MTGO.com. If you want to know about what the future holds for *Magic Online*, you won't want to miss either of these articles.

*Magic Online* Super Qualifiers
-------------------------------


As part of our initiatives to give you [more ways to play at home](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/FNM_at_Home), we wanted to provide options for you to play at the highest levels for competitive stakes. Therefore, in light of the [changes to the tabletop Players Tour Qualifiers announced earlier](https://magic.gg/news/changes-to-qualifiers-for-players-tour-series-2-events-and-schedule), we're adding a new series of qualifiers to [*Magic Online*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/what-magic-online-magic-online-products-game-info) to provide additional ways for players to compete and qualify for upcoming Players Tour events: *Magic Online* Super Qualifiers. These online events will run alongside existing *Magic Online* Qualifiers and will continue to invite players to Players Tour Series 2 events.


And in order to make the Super Qualifiers as exciting as possible, we've added more prizes! Players who earn 65th place through 128th place will receive 100 Play Points. These prizes are in addition to those previously announced. And, because we intend this to be a quality of the Super Qualifier events as a whole, we're retroactively adding these to events that have already concluded! Players who earned these prizes will have them granted before the end of this week.


Get event info [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2020#sq), read more about MTGO Super Qualifiers [here](https://magic.gg/news/announcing-magic-online-super-qualifiers), or check out the schedule below:

Showcase Challenge Weekend
--------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events, starting with the Showcase Challenges this weekend. These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and a Players Tour Finals invitation.


First up on Saturday, we have the Standard (6 a.m. PT), Modern (8 a.m. PT), and *Theros Beyond Death* Sealed (9 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Then on Sunday, we finish off with the Pioneer (6 a.m. PT), Legacy (8 a.m. PT), and Pauper (10 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Each of these events require 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate [Showcase Qualifier](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2020#sq).
