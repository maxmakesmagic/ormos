### Petr Brozek vs. Paul Rietzl (Draft)

Pro Tour journeyman Paul Rietzl finally grabbed the brass ring last year at Pro Tour Amsterdam, sweeping the Top 8 in nine straight games. His opponent this round, the Czech Republic's Petr Brozek, is still paying his dues as a PT regular. Brozek is best known for popularizing the red-white landfall Extended deck at GP Oakland last year.

### Game 1

Brozek mulliganed on the play, and his [Myrsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myrsmith) earned a [Virulent Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Virulent+Wound) from Rietzl. Rietzl followed up with [Necropede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropede), and after Brozek played [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol), added [Rot Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rot+Wolf) to the mix. Brozek played a third land and [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel), accepting the incoming poison damage.

Brozek had no fourth land, and simply passed the turn. Rietzl's monsters charged, but Brozek had [Divine Offering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Offering) for the [Necropede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropede) and animated his Idol to devour the Wolf. He stood at seven poison counters. Rietzl was also short on land. He tapped out for [Phyrexian Digester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Digester).

Brozek drew and shrugged his shoulders, then cast [Gore Vassal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gore+Vassal). Rietzl turned his guys sideways. Brozek then sacrificed the Vassal to kill the Digester, but Rietzl had [Untamed Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Untamed+Might) for a suddenly lethal strike.

Rietzl 1, Brozek 0

### Game 2

Brozek had turn-two [Myrsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myrsmith) again this game, and it survived a turn unscathed. Rietzl dropped [Plague Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Stinger), and Brozek swung in. Rietzl paused for a moment but accepted the trade.

"Maybe that guy's just really bad in your deck?" wonder Rietzl.

Brozek passed the turn on three land with no play. Rietzl played a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and passed. At end of turn Brozek cast [Master's Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master%27s+Call). He untapped and hit for 2, then tapped four and sighed, thinking. eventually he played [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold), signaling a potential blowout.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptpar11/r11_brozek.jpg)*Fun fact: That screen in the background is showing Brad Nelson at actual size.*All Rietzl could do was play [Corpse Cur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Cur) and pick up his [Plague Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Stinger). Unfortunately for him, it was even worse than he suspected. Brozek untapped and dropped [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel), supersizing his two Myr. Then he charged in with the team, and the [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) brought friends. He surveyed his attackers.

"So... 2/1, 2/1, 4/3, 4/3 and 3/4," Brozek enumerated.

The Cur stood in front of one of the Myr, and Rietzl took 11 damage, down to 7. He untapped and quickly played his fifth land, eager to [Spread the Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spread+the+Sickness) onto the [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) and finish off the infected Myr, but it was too late. Brozek added [Myr Galvanizer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Galvanizer) and attacked for six more, leaving Rietzl at 1. Rietzl agreed that he was dead.

### Game 3

Rietzl started by giving [Iron Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr) a [Virulent Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Virulent+Wound), then followed up with [Necropede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropede). He gamely swung in to Brozek's three open mana. [Divine Offering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Offering) knocked it off the table. Rietzl replaced it with [Tangle Mantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Mantis), and Brozek summoned [Chrome Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed) and passed.

Rietzl swung in for 3 and made a [Trigon of Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trigon+of+Corruption), tapping out. Brozek hit back for 2 and played [Myrsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myrsmith). Rietzl surveyed the situation and went into the tank for a minute. He tapped three for [Viridian Corrupter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Corrupter), knocking out the [Chrome Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed) and hit again. Brozek made no play, and Rietzl charged with his creatures, a mix of infect and noninfect.

"Two-pronged attack, here," said Rietzl. "Coming at you from both angles. Also, you only have twenty-seven cards left in your library. So... you know."

Brozek let it through. Rietzl played [Horizon Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Spellbomb) and passed. Brozek drew, played his seventh plains, and passed it right back. The Trigon spat out an Insect. Rietzl untapped and cracked his Spellbomb for a second [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), then attacked. [Myrsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myrsmith) blocked the [Corrupt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt)or and Seized the Initiative to kill it, and Brozek fell to 10 life and rose to four poison counters.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptpar11/r11_rietzl.jpg)*Rietzl looks high and low for a way to win a two-front war.*All Brozek could muster was a [Gold Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) and a bonus token from the [Myrsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myrsmith). Rietzl kept on making insect tokens and attacked again. The two tokens traded and Brozek's life dwindled. Next he made a [Gore Vassal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gore+Vassal), but Rietzl went over the top with his Trigon and [Carrion Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Call), swarming the board. They jammed into the red zone. [Myrsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myrsmith) and Vassal were forced to kill a pair of insects, and Brozek was down to 4 life and up to seven poison counters. Rietzl made [Bladed Pinions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladed+Pinions) and gave them to his Mantis. Still Brozek had nothing, just a wealth of [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). He conceded the game at 1 life and nine poison.

**Rietzl 2, Brozek 1**
