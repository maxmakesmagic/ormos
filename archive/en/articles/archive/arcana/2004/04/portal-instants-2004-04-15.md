**Magic**'s starter-level "Portal" sets -- *Portal*, *Portal Second Age*, and *Portal Three Kingdoms* -- were designed to expose new players to the fun of **Magic** without requiring them to learn too much complexity. The distinction between instants and sorceries was kept out; all non-creature spells in those sets were made card type "Sorcery." 

However, these sets had "sorceries" that could be played during combat, or during other players' turns: see [Assassins Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Assassins%2BBlade) or [Mystic Denial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mystic%2BDenial). In regular **Magic** play, these would of course be called instants.

Well, now they are.

In February of 2004, Wizards released Oracle wordings of the *Portal* and *Starter* sets (see the [DCI's Oracle page](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=dci/oracle) for complete collections of these wordings). Many of these cards became card type "Instant" in the new wordings, so now *Portal* has instants after all. Here's a list of all the *Portal* sorceries that became instants according to their Oracle text.
