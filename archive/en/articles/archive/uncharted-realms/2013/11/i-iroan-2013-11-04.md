 *The **ode** is a Classical form of [lyric poetry](http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5784). Its name comes from the Greek* aeidein*, "to sing," and this sort of poem was intended to be performed at public occasions to dancing and the strains of lyre and flute.  
  
 The most famous composer of odes in the ancient Greek world was [Pindar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindar), who is credited with inventing the form. His poems memorialized the winners of athletic competitions but also incorporated lofty ideals of philosophy and religion.  
  
 In this piece, I attempted to recall the lyrical style of Pindar in a victory ode to the champion of [the Iroan Games in Akros](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/262c).*

 The joyous name of Him, glory-crowned,  
 Who raises victor's pennant o'er battle ground,  
 Bestows His love on th' highest of poleis,  
 Bold Akros, paragon preeminent  
 In war, in peace eternal vigilant.  
 The Kolophon's apex blazes higher  
 Than sun-spear Khrusor's sacred fire  
 And Purphoros's forge; Keranan bolt  
 Of prophecy its epic ramparts smote.  
 Yet, eclipsing all, Thine aegis gleams,  
 Philomachos, who shields the deme.

 Brows bent, we pray, as Thou Anax  
 Endowed, in holy tournaments,  
 The wreath of mortal excellence,  
 Now bless Thy child, Pandamator.  
 Athlete superb, famed pankratist,  
 Euphoric in victory rose-kissed.  
 O tetrapteric-helmed, spear-shaking  
 Fame's epitome, bright-shining  
 Hoplite's lord, Iroas, hegemon.  
 Enthusiasts, eyes bright, oiled skin,  
 Thy happy youth, physiques aglow,  
 Gymnastic offertory show.  
 Akroan heir, the weighty pallium  
 Of honor lies, god's panoply,  
 On your character. Let all see  
 Humility, not hubris, as befits  
 Your family, Stratians, throne;  
 Or fall to grim Erebos, disowned.  
 Th'empyrial heights where Nymosyne,  
 Arissa, Lanathos, so many  
 Strove, whose phalanxes monsters slew  
 And kakomancers sent below,  
 Echo sweet paeans. In agora raise  
 Kylix and pause in reverent praise.
