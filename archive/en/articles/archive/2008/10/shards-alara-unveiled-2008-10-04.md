The *Shards of Alara* Launch Parties are this weekend! To get you prepared for *Shards of Alara*'s power, style, and flavor, take a step back in time to the set's Prerelease weekend for more than 60 minutes of audio coverage, from first glance to lasting impressions.


In this two-parter from the heart of England's historic capital city, Rich Hagon brings you the sights and sounds of the *Shards Of Alara*  Prerelease. In this first show, we meet a bunch of excited players and look through some of the new mechanics with the head judge. Then in part two, we follow former Limited Information writer Quentin Martin as he tries to build a ferociously tricky deck, meet globe-trotting star Dave Williams, and Rich goes into battle with [Hellkite Overlord](javascript:void()), and much more.
