Naturally, you have been on tenterhooks (look it up!) wondering what was going to happen after [last week's](/en/articles/archive/flight-white-cat-part-1-2008-10-08) exciting installment of *Flight of the White Cat*. And now, your wait is over. And did we mention that this comic exists in nine different languages simultaneously? It's true! So if you would prefer to read it in Chinese (Simplified), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, or Spanish, just click on the "Select Language/Country" link at the bottom of the page (in the dark grey bar) and then...enjoy! And remember, part three will be along in one week.

And now, part two of... [*Flight of the White Cat*](/en/node/627336)!
