### Life Tracker

Do you mostly play in tournaments? Or do you prefer Commander games around the kitchen table? **Magic: The Gathering Toolbox** comes with a variety of premade settings that you can tweak to your precise specifications. Track life, poison, floating mana, Commander damage, and more! You can track up to six players per game and their save profile information for later. And on iPad, you can track up to eight players!
