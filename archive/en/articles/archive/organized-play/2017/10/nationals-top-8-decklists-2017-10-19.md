The title is pretty descriptive for this week, and as a result this article is short and sweet. We've got some Top 8 Standard decklists for you from last weekend's Nationals, which featured the new Standard Constructed format following a rotation and the release of *Ixalan*!


All in all, 73 Nationals took place, qualifying two players from each country for this year's World *Magic* Cup, where they will join their nation's top Pro Point earner from the 2016–17 season to represent their country on the big stage in Nice, France, December 1–3.


For a full list of the World *Magic* Cup teams, [check out the invitation list](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/2017wmc/invitations) to see who will be representing each country.


Without further ado, decklists ahoy!
