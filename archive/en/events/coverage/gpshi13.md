Armed with only a single bye, Ryo Nakada fought his way through nearly 1800 players to emerge a champion. Playing a tweaked version of the White Weenie deck that put Ben Stark in the Top 4 of Grand Prix Dallas he swept Day 1 with a perfect 9-0 record, and didn't take a loss until Round 12. His opponent? Fellow finalist Shota Takao. Takao had been turning heads all weekend with his Esper Humans deck, and led the field into the Top 8.


Standard looked to be quite healthy as a variety of decks were on display. Mono-Blue Devotion, Mono-Red and Boros devotion decks, Control decks both Esper and Blue-White, and Black-based midrange decks, whether mono-colored or Black-White. That diversity was on display in the Top 8 as well. As the quarterfinals began, eyes were on the two big names, 2011 World Champion Junya Iyanaga and former Player of the Year Shouta Yasooka. Both of them fell to Takao's Esper Humans. Meanwhile on the other side of the bracket, Nakada swept Keisuke Sato's Colossal Gruul deck and scored a thrilling last-second victory against Hajime Nakashima's Mono-Blue Devotion.


It was only fitting that Nakada and Takao's match would go to three games. The hall was oddly quiet as spectators crowded around the feature match area three deep, and more watched rapt at big screens showing the live video coverage. In the decider, Nakada curved out an army, protected from [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) by [Xathrid Necromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Necromancer), and overran Takao.


Congratulations to Ryo Nakada, Grand Prix Shizuoka Champion!
