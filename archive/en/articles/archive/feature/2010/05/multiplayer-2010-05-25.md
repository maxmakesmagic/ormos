There are almost as many ways to play **Magic** with more than two people as there are **Magic** players. [These](/en/node/704521) are the most popular, including Free-for-All, Chaos, Grand Melee, Emperor, and Commander/EDH.

### Multiplayer Products

While you can use any **Magic** product in a multiplayer game, some products are specifically designed for use by more than two players.

***[Planechase](/en/node/702336)***: 

[![Planechase](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/tcg/resources/planechase.jpg)](/en/node/702336)The *Planechase* plane cards introduce a groundbreaking new way to experience planeswalking. Through this innovative new kind of card, two or more players can battle each other across a variety of diverse worlds, each with its own unique effect on the game. These thrilling new conditions add a whole new layer of chaos, meaning the only thing you can count on is unpredictability.

The *Planechase* game pack gives you the components you need to play a Planar Magic game. In this brand-new casual variant, you and your friends will take your **Magic: The Gathering** game skipping across the Multiverse. Each plane you visit (from old favorites you'll recognize to mysterious realms you'll get a sneak peek of) brings its distinctive flavor into your game, bending it just enough to keep things fresh. Planar Magic is an action-packed, larger-than-life way to enjoy your favorite game! 

***[Archenemy](/en/node/642781)***: 

[![Archenemy](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/tcg/products/archenemy/archenemy_productshot.jpg)](/en/node/642781)*You are the archenemy, and your goal is simple: the utter decimation of your fellow Planeswalkers. A force of unbridled malevolence, your power is so immense that their only hope is to join forces in a desperate attempt to defeat you.* 

An Archenemy game follows a “one vs. many” format. In this exciting new multiplayer variant, an oversized deck packed with brutal scheme cards allows one player to assume the role of the archenemy, a merciless paragon of power bent on total domination.

The other players in the game must unite to defeat the archenemy and save the day—if they can.

*Archenemy* will be released on June 18th, 2010.

### Multiplayer Forums
