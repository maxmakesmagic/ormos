| *Hello and welcome to Prismatic Tonight. I'm your host, Doug Beyer.*
*Katie Couric is away on vacation.*
*Our top story tonight is a wave of [bannings](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=dci/announce/dci20040901a) that hit ***Magic** Online's* Prismatic format in September, rendering the format radically changed but ultimately, in the opinion of one reporter, more fun. We turn now to Beffle549 with the report.* |

###  TOP STORY: In Praise of Bannings

I had a first-hand chance to see some of the destruction the bannings had caused. Powerful tutor bases were demolished. [Sundering Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) was left homeless. Entire ways of deckbuilding, dashed in one sweep of the DCI's hand. 

And the players couldn't be happier.



|  |
| --- |
| *Am I the only one who gets queasy when he sees this?* |

That's right: we players of Prismatic have come to understand the bannings as a gift from above, a way to appreciate the quirks of our format without losing the powerful cards we love to play. I can remember when one [Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Burning%2BWish) combined with a sufficiently stocked collection meant game over, no matter the game-state. When [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) filled players' graveyards with a rainbow of broken flashback spells. When a disgusting [Krosan Tusker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker)-[Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) loop was set up with the flick of a [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive). 

There were so many of these game-ending and difficult-to-disrupt tutoring options in the environment that a Prismatic deck could merely be a collection of them, and the best decks had them all. Decks had little reason for variation or even theme, and became stocked with tutor engines and one-of “silver bullet” toolboxes. Setting up inescapably brutal boards was easier with five-color 250-card decks than in tournament constructed formats. 

Of course, there were exceptions. Many players used Wishes for fun ways to grab their favorite foil creatures or to set up hilarious [Panoptic Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panoptic+Mirror) imprints, or simply to find a land. Some players [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive)'d a suite of [Laquatus' Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laquatus%27+Champion)s to pull off unlikely combo-kills with [Twilight's Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight%27s+Call). But these decks just couldn't compete with one-card engines like [Wild Research](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Research) or inexorable loops like [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) + [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness).

What is life like after the bannings? Quieter. Wackier. Less consistent. More fun. Flashback cards still generate card advantage, but you draw them one at a time now. Comes-into-play-effect creatures still advance your strategies while getting you a body, but sometimes you draw the [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) instead of tutoring up [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu) perfectly on time. [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) still rules the playing field, but it's much harder to get into the grave with anything good to recur. [Jilt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jilt) and [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod) and [Desolation Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desolation+Giant) still wreck house, but they sit in your hand instead of your collection to wait for their moment. And [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) is still 11/11 trample and indestructible, but you have to pay mana for him. *All*  the mana.

| **What's a Tutor?**
 A "tutor," in a **Magic** context, loosely means a card that searches for another card. It's based on the venerable [Demonic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Tutor) or the more recent [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor), but also includes more restricted searching effects like [Eladamri's Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eladamri%27s+Call) (creatures only) or [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) (sorceries only, and searches a collection instead of your library). Prismatic's recent bannings removed many tutors from the format. |

### What Tutors Remain

There are still ways to draw just the card you need out of your 250-carder, but now it's at a reasonable cost—and some formerly second-tier tutors have leaped into the limelight. 

* Few people cast a even sidelong glance at [Diabolic Intent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Intent) before, but now it's an efficient way for creature-heavy decks to search for a bomb, especially if that bomb can make up the lost card advantage.
* [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) is great even if it's only searching up Wayfarer's Bauble or your Incarnation-hosing [Scrabbling Claws](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrabbling+Claws), but I generally see it grabbing the still-ridiculous [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). (I wouldn't be surprised to see the ‘Clamp leave this format as well one day. I worry when I see people playing [Taj-Nar Swordsmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taj-Nar+Swordsmith) and/or [Steelshaper's Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steelshaper%27s+Gift) with only one piece of equipment in their decks.)
* [Fierce Empath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fierce+Empath) is fierce indeed these days: he gets you a [Krosan Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Krosan%2BTusker) or a landcycler before you're at six mana, or a huge beastie after. Compare that to [Merchant of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+of+Secrets)...
* Speaking of elves, [Wirewood Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Herald), the “chump-tutor champeen,” gets you quite an array of utili-elves these days, from [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) to [Glissa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa) to [Caller of the Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caller+of+the+Claw) to [Elvish Aberration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Aberration).
* [Planar Portal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Portal) is and always has been slow, slow, slow. Luckily, so is this format sometimes, so this ultra-tutor can pull its weight when the game comes down to late-game topdeck wars.

And then there's the [Bringer of the Black Dawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Bringer%2Bof%2Bthe%2BBlack%2BDawn). Let's talk about him for a second.

![Bringer of the Black Dawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bringer+of+the+Black+Dawn)### The Case for Bringer of the Black Dawn

[Bringer of the Black Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bringer+of+the+Black+Dawn) is a 5/5 black creature castable with ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif). It replaces a draw with a tutor for the cost of 2 life per upkeep. Isn't this a one-card tutor engine just like [Wild Research](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Research) or [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive), attached to a big trampling body to boot?

Well, yes. And I have a feeling that R&D considered banning it along with the other tutors. But its main drawback is that it *is* attached to that big trampling body. Sure it's a 5-toughness black creature, but if **Magic** is full of anything it's full of ways to kill creatures. You spend three turns [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth)ing and [Far Wanderings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Far+Wanderings)'ing for mana to cast your prized Bringer. Then you tap out on your fifth turn for the black Bringer to block your opponent's rampaging [Blind Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Creeper) and to tutor for a card that can stabilize you…and your opponent untaps and casts [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), or [Beacon of Destruction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Destruction), or [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet)s your Bringer after combat damage, or whatever. It's not immune. I can tell you that it actually feels a bit fragile—you pin your hopes on tutoring up a chain of [Avarax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avarax)es or [Head Games](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Head+Games)'ing your opponent's grip or going nuts with [Mirari's Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake) and [Future Sight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Future+Sight), and instead you've [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed a removal spell for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) and you're still getting hit with that 3/3 (okay, Blind Creeper might be 2/2 this turn). Add that to the fact that Prismatic has almost no ways of tutoring for a Bringer anymore (the aforementioned [Fierce Empath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fierce+Empath) is basically it, baby) and it's not as big a deal as you might think. Of course, that's not much consolation when you're staring down an active Bringer *without* a [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) or whatever in hand, but hey, it's still a great creature. Just not a brokenly hard-to-deal-with one. 

There's one last tutor still left Prismatic that I should mention—soon to become, in many players' opinion, the most important repeatable tutor of all.

*Thanks, Beffle549. Stay tuned, folks, for these important messages. After the break, Beffle099 tells us why* Champions of Kamigawa *is her favorite Prismatic set yet.

### Special Message: [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger)

RHODA: Jan, why does your Red Zone always smell so lemony fresh? 

JAN: It's simple, Rhoda. I use [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger).

RHODA: [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger)? That 5-mana red Beast? But I thought Prismatic decks didn't usually run much red. Doesn't it have a high red commitment?

JAN: That's true, Rhoda. But I always have room in my pantry for [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger)! It does the job of ten other sweepers, even if I can only make ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif). It clears my board, swings for 4, and goes to the head. It also picks up the kids from soccer practice. In short, it's a game-winner!

![Test Results Show!](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/Prismatic_ArcSloggerGraph.jpg)

RHODA [holding [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger)]: Ahh, [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger). So that's your secret! [wags a finger good-naturedly at Jan, then glances across the table] Uh, oh, my opponent has a morph creature!

JAN: Guess it's time for *you* to *Get Da Slog!*


RHODA AND JAN: [laugh]

ANNOUNCER: Get your [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger) today! Find it in the *Mirrodin* aisle. *Get Da Slog*!

*Welcome back, everyone. We turn now to Beffle099, who has a report on a new plane landing at Prismatic Interplanar Airport: the world of Kamigawa.* |

### *Champions of Kamigawa* comes to Prismatic

I was ecstatic to see *Champions of Kamigawa* release in ***Magic*** *Online*. The set offers plenty of new toys for Prismatic players to choose from, including fatties, legends, utility creatures, opportunities for card advantage, and some of the best mana-fixing ever. And I mean ever.

### Mana Fixing

In a format that already had fourteen sets' worth of green cards and color-friendly artifacts feeding it, it would have been tough to improve on the mana-fixing Prismatic already had available. Well, [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) has succeeded anyway: it is, in almost every circumstance and game situation, and for the same cost, better than that absolute Prismatic staple, Rampant Growth. You've already heard about its success at [Champs](/en/events/coverage/2004-champs-decklists) a week ago, but this card will be an automatic four-of in Prismatic now too. It may be proper now to run both Elder *and* 
[Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth), and remove four of something slower, such as [Far Wanderings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Far+Wanderings) or [Journey of Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+of+Discovery): the [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) effect for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif), whether as a Snake or as a Sorcery, is just enormously efficient acceleration-plus-color-fixing. And [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) does all the things that creatures can do—it can attack and block, get recurred with [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) or [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) or [Oversold Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversold+Cemetery), imprint onto a [Soul Foundry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Foundry) for evil fun, pick up a [Sword of Fire and Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice), et cetera. Let's see your Sorcery version do *that*.

![Kodama's Reach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kodama%27s+Reach)And hey. It's common. Get four. You probably already have four…

Speaking of terrific common mana-fixers, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach). [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) joins [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow) and [Journey of Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+of+Discovery) on the list of three-mana methods to secure access to two different colors with one spell, which can obviously be a huge boon in your Prismatic mana development. I'm not sure it's better than [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow), which is worse to have countered, but can be cast as an instant. I do think it's better than [Journey of Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+of+Discovery), however. [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) does for a smooth three mana almost all of the work that [Journey of Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+of+Discovery) does entwined for six.

Speaking of journeying, I'm curious to see what [Journeyer's Kite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journeyer%27s+Kite) can do. It is awfully good at getting you a basic land every turn if that's the kind of thing you want to do, but I'm not sure that its ability to do that long-term is really what a regular Prismatic deck wants. A regular Prismatic deck wants a sudden, early boost of multicolor mana ramping, and the Kite may be more of a midgame card. I think there are possibilities for using it for decks that create a huge board full of permanents that slowly take over the game, like [Mobilization](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mobilization) or [Future Sight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Future+Sight), or for decks that use land as a raw resource, like [Goblin Trenches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Trenches) or [Wand of the Elements](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wand+of+the+Elements), however. Surely it's something to consider. Let's move on to the new library-searching spells available in *Champions*.

### Tutors of Kamigawa

*Champions of Kamigawa* comes with an interesting set of conditional tutors. [Eerie Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eerie+Procession) gets you an Arcane spell for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) in your main phase—a bit slow, but perhaps just the thing for a control deck that needs to find the right type of removal right now, or for a deck that wants to set up some Splice tricks. [Godo, Bandit Warlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godo%2C+Bandit+Warlord) is a very nice way to get out a game-ending [Tatsumasa, the Dragon's Fang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tatsumasa%2C+the+Dragon%27s+Fang), but playing it to grab [Lightning Greaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves) and just swing—*twice*—is a fine alternative. [Iname, Death Aspect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iname%2C+Death+Aspect) gets you a graveyard full of spirits, which gets you ready for soulshifting action or just for “Entombing” [Eternal Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Dragon). [Night Dealings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Dealings) is a very fun card that you should try out—I'd love to see it combined with a [Granite Shard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Shard), [Plague Spitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Spitter), or some other repeatable damage source to help protect itself and your other resources.

[Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) is a very powerful, but very thinky, tutor. Will [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) win the award for “Card Responsible for the Most Waiting Time” in Prismatic? I mean, you get to hunt for four different cards from your now 240-some-odd-card library, and meanwhile you feel like you should have some sort of strategy—ideally you're looking for four similar cards, or two pairs of similar cards, or a way to nastily give your opponent no real choices. Do play one or more copies of this card, but do the world a favor: when you put it in your deck, please have two or three different gameplans in mind for when you're going to cast it. Here are a few for your consideration:

**Some [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) Packets**

* The “Removal Recursion”: [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu), [Thornscape Battlemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Battlemage), [Oversold Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversold+Cemetery) and [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis)
* The “Bad Choice”: [All Suns' Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Suns%27+Dawn), [Anarchist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist), [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger)
* The “Guaranteed Sweeper”: [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), [Akroma's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance), [Starstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starstorm), [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed)
* The “Incarnation Headache”: [Anger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger), [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder), [Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory), [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis)

I'm sure you can come up with more (it's something good to do while you download chk.pig—gotta love those colorful ***Magic*** *Online* filenames). With these packets-o'-goodies held firmly in mind ahead of time, you might actually get your Gifts before your opponent's concession leaves them, sadly, Ungiven. 

![Time of Need](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Time+of+Need)Moving on to my favorite *Champions* tutor of all.

For this reporter, it's all about [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need). [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need) is [Living Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) for your favorite legend—and you have over 40 new legendary creatures added to the card pool (bringing the total to about 100 in the Prismatic environment). It could be Time for the quick beats of [Pianna, Nomad Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Pianna%252C%2BNomad%2BCaptain) or the defense of [Lieutenant Kirtar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lieutenant+Kirtar). It could be Time for [Llawan, Cephalid Empress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Llawan%252C%2BCephalid%2BEmpress) to finally keep your opponent's [Arcanis the Omnipotent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Arcanis%2Bthe%2BOmnipotent) at bay, or Time for [Empress Galina](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empress+Galina) to steal it away. It could be Time to lock out your opponent with [Braids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids) or ping with [Jeska, Warrior Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Jeska%252C%2BWarrior%2BAdept). Artifact removal? [Glissa, Sunseeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa%2C+Sunseeker). Lifegain? [Gerrard Capashen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard+Capashen). Creature removal? [Visara](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara). Counter support? [Ertai the Corrupted](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ertai+the+Corrupted). Air force? [Rith, the Awakener](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rith%2C+the+Awakener). Game over? Hello, [Akroma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma)? Can you come out and play? Oh, you're busy? Send [Phage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phage) out then!

And don't forget that [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need) can tutor up legend *removal* of sorts, now, too. If your opponent's [Rorix Bladewing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix+Bladewing) is about to eat your head, tell your own Rorix: “Hey, it's kind of a [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need) over here,” and your own copy will tell that imposter across the board a little story about the new Legend Rule. Of course you have to be able to cast the legend you're going to duplicate, but hey, that's pretty good for a relatively tutorless format.

### Solid New Additions

What other toys does the set bring us?

### 

Dudes


From the rarefied heights of [Myojin of Cleansing Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myojin+of+Cleansing+Fire) down to the weenie utility of Hana Kami, there are a lot of quality creatures in *Champions*. Any of the flipping “heroes” that does something useful (Nezumi Shortfang) or beats efficiently (Budoka Gardener) before flipping is worth a look. The “spiritcraft” creatures like Soilshaper or Earthshaker can get along nicely in a spirit-heavy deck. There are cheap utility legends from [Kiku, Night Flower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%2C+Night+Flower) (if you're emphasizing black) to [Eight-and-a-Half-Tails](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eight-and-a-Half-Tails) (if you're emphasizing white). And there are finishers aplenty: [Kumano, Master Yamabushi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kumano%252C%2BMaster%2BYamabushi), any of the Dragon Spirits (especially the nicely splashable [Keiga, Tide Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+Tide+Star) and [Ryusei, Falling Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ryusei%2C+Falling+Star)), [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree), [Konda, Lord of Eiganjo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%2C+Lord+of+Eiganjo). And in the dark horse category, there's little [Zo-Zu the Punisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zo-Zu+the+Punisher): I'd like to see Zo-Zu in a deck designed to exploit Prismatic's tendency to fill the board with lands.

![Rend Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rend+Flesh)**Removal**Something in your way? *Champions* has new options for getting through to that planeswalker across the table. [Rend Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rend+Flesh) is my favorite here; it provides a great new way to kill almost all the critters around. [Blind with Anger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+with+Anger) is a worthy trick for your red 20, capable of 2-for-1s. [Reciprocate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reciprocate) can really round out your white cards, especially if you're trying to deemphasize your double-white mana cost requirements. [Pain Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain+Kami) is a [Blaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blaze) on legs, but there are probably faster options. Also consider both [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami) and [Kami of Ancient Law](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law), which are cheap bears that double as removal. Red has good burn in Champions; I'm especially interested in the reusable [Hanabi Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanabi+Blast) and the splicing possibilities of [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray).

**Other Goodies**

This reporter's favorite cycle in *Champions* is the legendary Hondens. Any of them is splashable and fine on its own—I'd especially consider [Honden of Life's Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honden+of+Life%27s+Web) for a steady army, and [Honden of Seeing Winds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honden+of+Seeing+Winds) for a one-sided [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine). It says something about their power if I'm recommending them in a 250-card format: you're going to like getting their repeated effects even if they don't “power up” with multiple Shrines as they were designed to do—or you're going to like seeing your opponent use a [Vindicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) on that rather than on your creature that is beating him down.

Be sure to get a copy of each of the legendary color-aligned lands: they're all great if you draw them and they can replace a basic land with no worries about them coming into play tapped or pinging you. I'm especially fond of [Shizo, Death's Storehouse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shizo%2C+Death%27s+Storehouse). Plus you can tap [Captain Sisay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captain+Sisay) for one of these lands if your opponent's copy is bugging you—remember the new Legend Rule. Lastly, if you didn't have enough reasons to run them, they can all kill an opposing [Horobi, Death's Wail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horobi%2C+Death%27s+Wail)!

A piece of equipment I'm quite impressed with is [Kusari-Gama](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kusari-Gama). If you've never played it or been wrecked by it, read through it a couple of times. Go ahead, it takes a good thorough read. Basically the equipped creature becomes a massive thorn in your opponent's side—either it has firebreathing or it unleashes Japanese chain-style death on his entire team. 

There's plenty more where that came from. Try putting together a Singleton Prismatic deck, and try out all the *Champions* goodies you can get your hands on. The set is one of the most surprisingly synergistic sets in **Magic**—and that's a new twist for a format that's mostly about maximizing single cards.

*Thanks, Beffle099, for that report. We turn back, now, to Beffle549 for the conclusion of his report: the repeatable tutor whose stock is rising in the post-*Champions* Prismatic format.* |

###  That Sassy Sisay

It's already been mentioned that [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need) is a great new tutor. But the most important legend you'll probably be tutoring for in the new Prismatic is, of course, that legend tutor herself—[Captain Sisay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captain+Sisay).

![Captain Sisay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Captain+Sisay)She was great before. She's just about insane now. She grabs everything that [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need) grabs, and oh, and she also tutors for [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and [Legacy Weapon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legacy+Weapon), too. Prismatic players, take note: keep a [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) (or an analogue thereof) handy.

It's always an exciting time to watch a new set—especially a whole new block—seep its way into your favorite format. I'll see you at the Prismatic tables.

### As the Credits Roll...

* One player cast [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) to blow up a random [Vault of Whispers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+of+Whispers). When his opponent took his turn to tap out for the notoriously powerful [Mind's Eye](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Eye), it looked bad for the Shaman's controller—but that player [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse)d his own Shaman and replayed it before a single card could be drawn from the artifact. Do the card advantage math—it adds up to approximately +(a zillion) for the Shaman player.
* One player discarded [Akroma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma) to his [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). But did he immediately attack for three with the Mongrel? He did not. He first cast [Betrayal of Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal+of+Flesh) on that dead [Akroma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma), reanimating it, and swung with the 3/3 Mongrel *and* the 6/6 flying first-striking trampling pro-red-and-black legendary angel. Sensible.
* This anecdote is about the power of the quick beatdown. One player had stabilized at 6 life, after developing a scary board of [Sliver Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen) and [Mirari's Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake)—and was ready to unleash an army of 2/2 sliver tokens (and arm them with [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp)). But his opponent calmly played [Dirge of Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirge+of+Dread) to give his [Cabal Archon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Archon) and [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) fear, attacked for 4, and threw the Archon at the head for the win. It doesn't take expensive creatures to do 20, folks.
* During one turn, a player cast an [Engineered Explosives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) for 0, sacced it to [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) to kill [Bringer of the Red Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bringer+of+the+Red+Dawn), cast [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) to get back [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast), sacced a [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) to kill [Blazing Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Specter), and then [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet)ted a third creature.
* One player put [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) on a fully sunburst [Etched Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Oracle), with a mana up. Ughhhhh.
* One player cast a chaining army of [Embermage Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermage+Goblin)s (a stylish alternative to the brutal [Avarax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avarax)). When his opponent [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake)d for 1, he had [Oversold Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversold+Cemetery) to recover them one by one. Unfortunately he eventually lost to an [Empyrial Plate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empyrial+Plate)d [Shoreline Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shoreline+Ranger).
