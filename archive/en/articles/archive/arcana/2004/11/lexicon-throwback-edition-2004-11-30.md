Welcome to a Throwback Week edition of [The Lexicon](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/columnarchive&column=thelexicon), in which you can learn the meanings of some of the more obscure words we use in the names of older cards. While many of the offbeat names (like "[Tyrranax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tyrranax)") are simply made up, we often dig around dictionaries for real little-used and archaic words for inspiration. Check out these Lexicon entries drawn from cards printed in 1997 and before.
