**Name:** Bernardo Santos


**Age:** 25


**Occupation:** Student and Gobern's only friend


**Hometown:** Lisbon, Portugal


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Two GP Top 8s, qualified for the second time for MOCS this year, Gold pro.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Humans because I think it has game against everything in an open Modern field. I've also done well with it before and like the deck.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial). It showed up in my opening hands and I rarely drew it later on.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg). I played against Jeskai and White-Blue a lot, so the Kithkin overperformed.

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus). The flying was so relevant in a world of ground creatures.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft), it gave me a lot of play against spot removal and was responsible for three match wins by itself.

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Krark-Clan Ironworks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks), when it resolves I win the game.

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


Resurrected [Cursecatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursecatcher) a.k.a [Mausoleum Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Wanderer). Reminds me of simpler times.

All equally strong cards, hard to pick one.

**Name:** Lauri Pispa


**Age:** 31


**Occupation:** Owner and only employee of *Magic* card shop "Sensei's Divining Shop"


**Hometown:** Tampere, Finland


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Two Pro Tours and Top 8 at World *Magic* Cup as captain.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Hardened Affinity. I talked to Sam Pardee about it four to five months ago, since he brought it to the light of day. I really liked it then, but something was missing and I didn't play it after. This Friday, I had the crazy idea to play it since it felt like a good choice for this metagame, and it was! Three hours of practice and let's go!


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Animation Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animation+Module). Had few Hardene Scales hands on Day 1, but [Animation Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animation+Module) came through and won me most of the games.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


Nothing in particular. Some I didn't even bring in throughout the whole tournament. My sideboard is just answers for tough cards like [Stony Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stony+Silence) and [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace).

**Name:** Theau Mery


**Age:** 23


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Yerres, next to Paris, France


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Finished second in Vegas last year, and some 11-4 finishes.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Humans, because it's broken. I'm convinced something should be banned. Until then—If you can't beat them, join them.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider). It won me so many games on the spot, and I never lost a race with it.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) was the best. I only ever beat Miracles with this card. [Kambal, Consul of Allocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kambal%2C+Consul+of+Allocation) and [Hostage Taker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostage+Taker) were pretty good as well.

**Name:** Joakim Haram


**Age:** 28


**Occupation:** Production engineer


**Hometown:** Trondheim, Norway


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


FNM end boss.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Bant Spirits, played the deck even before it got [Supreme Phantom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Phantom). Deck was already pretty good then, so I didn't need much convincing.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Mausoleum Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Wanderer) for allowing me to have eraly pressure and making it very hard for opponents to play *Magic*.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Unified Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unified+Will). A counter spell is usually a good card to have in a tempo deck that likes to keep mana open, In the matchups where you bring it in, it's fantastic.
