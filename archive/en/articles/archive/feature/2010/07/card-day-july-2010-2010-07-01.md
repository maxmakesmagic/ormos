Card of the Day - July, 2010

By Wizards of the Coast











![Voltaic Key](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Voltaic+Key)**[Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key)** – ***Magic** 2011* uncommon. Although its glory days untapping [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith)s and [Phyrexian Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Colossus)es are a tough act to follow, [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) has plenty of fun stuff to do in ***Magic** 2011*, letting you double up on [Temple Bell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Bell), [Steel Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer), and [Crystal Ball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystal+Ball). But for maximum style points, combine the Key with [Sorcerer's Strongbox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorcerer%27s+Strongbox) to get two shots at opening it—and, if you take the second shot with the first one still on the stack, you've even got a shot at drawing *six* cards!
 ![Dragon's Claw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dragon%27s+Claw)**[Dragon's Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon%27s+Claw)** – ***Magic** 2011* uncommon. The *Darksteel* "charms" have become a core set staple, with [Dragon's Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon%27s+Claw) even cracking Standard play occasionally. In ***Magic** 2011*, [Dragon's Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon%27s+Claw) features new flavor text from—who else?—the dragon-worshipping Planeswalker [Sarkhan Vol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Vol).
 ![Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Steel+Overseer)**[Steel Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer)** – ***Magic** 2011* rare. In addition to pumping itself to monstrous proportions and refueling Triskelions in ***Magic** 2011* Limited, [Steel Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer) can partner up in casual with another artificial taskmaster, the modular-loving [Arcbound Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Overseer), for extra counter-counting shenanigans. (Doubling Season would like to help too!)
 ![Elixir of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Elixir+of+Immortality)**[Elixir of Immortality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality)** – ***Magic** 2011* uncommon. The flavor text of [Elixir of Immortality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality) marks the first new flavor text attributed to [Baron Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir) since *Fifth Edition*, when several older cards—[Deathgrip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathgrip), [Fallen Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Angel), and [Sengir Autocrat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Autocrat)—featured new quotes from the old-school **Magic** baddie, and another card, [Lifeforce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifeforce), let his adversary [Autumn Willow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Autumn+Willow) get a word in against him.
 ![Sword of Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sword+of+Vengeance)**[Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance)** – ***Magic** 2011* rare. The abilities granted by [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance) echo the abilities of [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath). As the flavor text notes, we can't say for sure that it's the real deal. Still, this card does subtly imply that without her sword, Akroma would be a 4/6 with flying and protection from black and from red.
 ![Temple Bell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Temple+Bell)**[Temple Bell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Bell)** – ***Magic** 2011* rare. You don't need us to tell you that [Temple Bell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Bell) is worth playing in a multiplayer game, do you? Of course not! But we do have one tip: if you yell "BONNGGGGGGG!" every time you tap it, you're probably not going to be invited back for the next game.
 ![Angelic Arbiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Angelic+Arbiter)**[Angelic Arbiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Arbiter)** – ***Magic** 2011* rare. While it's always fun to play cards that affect everyone in a multiplayer game directly (who doesn't like giving everyone life with one hand and damage with the other?) there's something to be said about [Angelic Arbiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Arbiter)'s ability to change the way everyone *plays*. And that something is "keep a [Safe Passage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safe+Passage) in reserve to keep the angel alive."
 ![Hunters' Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hunters%27+Feast)**[Hunters' Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunters%27+Feast)** – ***Magic** 2011* common. Historically, cards have tended to target either one player or all of them, with a few [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)-style cards that cost mana for additional targets. [Hunters' Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunters%27+Feast) takes a new path, letting you distribute life to only those players you deem worthy.
 ![Blood Tithe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blood+Tithe)**[Blood Tithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Tithe)** – ***Magic** 2011* common. In a multiplayer game, some people like to avoid making enemies. Which is only logical; if enough people want you dead, you're going to lose. But there's something to be said for smacking everyone in the face simultaneously while sitting back on your pile of stolen life. Consider working in a maniacal laugh, too.
 ![Conundrum Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Conundrum+Sphinx)**[Conundrum Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conundrum+Sphinx)** – ***Magic** 2011* rare. In a two-player game, [Conundrum Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conundrum+Sphinx) potentially helps both the attacker and the defender. But with more people in the game, more people get to play along. Want to make everyone at the table happy? Start attacking!
 ![Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Garruk+Wildspeaker)**[Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker)** – ***Magic** 2011* mythic rare. From his [Planeswalker page](/en/node/637016): Garruk is a hunter to the core, a planeswalking predator whose hunting ground is the entire Multiverse. Gripped with a need to test his might and resolve against greater and greater challenges, his life's calling has become an endless hunt of the most ferocious and dangerous game that each plane can offer.
 ![Chandra Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chandra+Nalaar)**[Chandra Nalaar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Nalaar)** – ***Magic** 2011* mythic rare. From her [Planeswalker page](/en/node/636776): There's no virtue in subtlety—at least not as far as the fire-mage Chandra Nalaar is concerned. Impulsive, passionate, and short-tempered, she's as ready to explode as the pyromantic spells of her ever-growing repertoire.
 ![Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Liliana+Vess)**[Liliana Vess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess)** – ***Magic** 2011* mythic rare. From her [Planeswalker page](/en/node/637331): Beautiful, cunning, and ambitious to a fault, Liliana Vess is quietly one of the Multiverse's most magnetic dangers. Liliana's dark charisma is undeniable—she's agelessly striking and sharp as the edge of a razor.
 ![Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jace+Beleren)**[Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren)** – ***Magic** 2011* mythic rare. From his [Planeswalker page](/en/node/637146): Curiosity has always gotten the better of Jace Beleren. As a magical prodigy, he delved into lessons of sorcery deeper than the other students in mage academies, and succeeded to the point that even his instructors were suspicious of him.
 ![Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ajani+Goldmane)**[Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane)** – ***Magic** 2011* mythic rare. From his [Planeswalker page](/en/articles/archive/2008-08-12-0): Ajani Goldmane is torn between his leonin ferocity and his sense of justice. He was born as an outcast within his own family, an albino leonin never accepted by the rest of his pride.
 ![Manic Vandal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Manic+Vandal)**[Manic Vandal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal)** – ***Magic** 2011* common. [Manic Vandal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal) is very much like [Uktabi Orangutan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Orangutan), except that it's red. Why does this ability get to be red? The flavor text suggests one explanation: "It's fun. He doesn't need another reason."
 ![Mystifying Maze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mystifying+Maze)**[Mystifying Maze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystifying+Maze)** – ***Magic** 2011* rare. How does [Mystifying Maze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystifying+Maze) compare to [Maze of Ith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze+of+Ith)? On Twitter, Aaron Forsythe said, "I don't think Ith did it right. His maze sent you home. This new one is one you actually get lost in for a while."
 ![Teferi's Puzzle Box](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Teferi%27s+Puzzle+Box)**[Teferi's Puzzle Box](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Puzzle+Box)** – *Ninth Edition* rare. Some people like to use cards like [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) in their multiplayer decks in an attempt to make everyone at the table happy. You could do that. Or you could go the other way with a card like [Teferi's Puzzle Box](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Puzzle+Box) and actively mess with *everyone at once*! We're just saying.
 ![Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Leyline+of+the+Void)**[Leyline of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void)** – *Guildpact* rare. [Leyline of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void) is based on *Urza's Saga*'s [Planar Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Void). But in addition to the obvious, um, Leyline-ness, it's better in another way: [Planar Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Void) affects all graveyards, but the Leyline affects only your opponents'!
 ![Deathmark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Deathmark)**[Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark)** – ***Magic** 2010* uncommon. A lot of different factors go into choosing the [Wallpaper of the Week](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-archive-2008-08-23). Sometimes ([like today](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-ajanis-pridemate-2010-07-02)) it's chosen because it's an image of a cool aspect of a new set. But when [Deathmark was wallpaper-ized](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-deathmark-2009-08-28), it was just because we wanted to see what that looked like when it was huge. Answer: it is disturbing!
 ![Emblem of the Warmind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Emblem+of+the+Warmind)**[Emblem of the Warmind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emblem+of+the+Warmind)** – *Future Sight* uncommon. The little sunburst-like symbol in the upper left of [Emblem of the Warmind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emblem+of+the+Warmind) is a special feature of the future-shifted frame, and it signifies that the card is an enchantment. The complete list is in [this Arcana](/en/articles/archive/future-sight%E2%80%99s-card-type-symbols-2007-05-24). And now that we're in the future, you can see those symbols in the card search in **Magic Online**.
