If you look carefully at *Shards of Alara* cards, you can sometimes see planeswalkers strolling through, interacting with the scenery. Or, in the case of the three "Soul's" cards, busting things up. Observe!

In [Soul's Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul%27s+Fire), Ajani is seen creating a fiery avatar of himself, an incarnation of his passion and fury.

In [Soul's Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul%27s+Grace), Ajani is again working from the background, bestowing his pridemate with a ghostly avatar of himself.

Finally, in [Soul's Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul%27s+Might), Ajani uses his otherworldly power and wisdom to imbue a cat warrior with more inner strength.

Of course, those aren't the only cards where Ajani can be spotted...
