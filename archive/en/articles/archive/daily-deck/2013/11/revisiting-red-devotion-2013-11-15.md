Revisiting Red Devotion
=======================

Luis Scott-Vargas plays, writes, and makes videos about Magic. He has played on the Pro Tour for almost a decade, and between that and producing content for ChannelFireball, often has his hands full (of cards). 







As a whole, Team [ChannelFireball](http://store.channelfireball.com/landing) was fairly devoted to red at [Pro Tour *Theros*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptths13/welcome). We had [Stormbreath Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon)s and Purphoroses aplenty, and were ready and willing to battle against Esper. Unfortunately, Esper was less represented than we predicted, [Master of Waves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) and [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) showed up in greater quantities than we'd hoped, and our tireless devotion was not rewarded as well as it could have been.


Fortunately for the red gods, the time is now right to pick up a hammer and strike while the iron is hot. Ben Stark has been playing an updated list of our Pro Tour deck to good results, both online and off, and the recent surge of [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) decks certainly has contributed to his success.


The main deck is almost exactly the same, with [Mizzium Mortars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars) replacing [Xenagos, the Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler). As satyrsfying as it is to use [Xenagos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos) to make an army, Mortars does more what the deck needs and helps the deck improve its matchup against creature decks. [Xenagos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos) is much more anti-control, and this deck is already pretty biased against that.


Ben tinkered with the sideboard with the express purpose of bringing the beats, with [Firedrinker Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firedrinker+Satyr) and [Skullcrack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack) against Mono-Black Control and [Mistcutter Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistcutter+Hydra) against blue decks. Instead of trying to play the control role against these decks better suited for it, Ben would rather just go to the face with [Savannah Lions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions) and [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s (essentially). [Mistcutter Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistcutter+Hydra) is basically just a [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball), with the additional upside of sticking around for more hits.


This deck is more metagame-dependent than many, just because the value of [Hammer of Purphoros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammer+of+Purphoros), Purphoros himself, and [Stormbreath Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) can vary wildly, but it's definitely powerful enough to be worth looking at it if you are sick of losing to [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) (which I'm not sick of casting yet, by the way).
