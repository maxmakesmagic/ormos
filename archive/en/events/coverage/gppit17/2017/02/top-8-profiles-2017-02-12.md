 **![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gppit17/t8_vanfleet.jpg)Name:** Adam Van Fleet


**Age:** 30


**Hometown:** Syracuse, New York


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Pro Tour Top 25 at Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx;* Top 8 here, and pre-release champion :)


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Black-Green Delirium; I wanted a deck that was tuned to beat the black-green and Mardu meta. Also, Reid Duke is rarely wrong.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Fatal Push](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Push) is fantastic, but I’ll have to say [Winding Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor).


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Scrapheap Scrounger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapheap+Scrounger). It gives you a fighting chance against control.


**First it was Copycat, then it was Vehicles, now it’s Black-Green; what’s next for *Aether Revolt* Standard?** I think it will stay black-green for a while, but it’s a good time to play control.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** Back to the Pro Tour! I didn’t think I’d be able to grind back through the PPTQ system.

**Hometown:** New Jersey


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Top 8 at Grand Prix San Jose 2017


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Black-Green Delirium - Reid Duke made a good case for it.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Fatal Push](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Push) for its efficiency.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Gonti, Lord of Luxury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gonti%2C+Lord+of+Luxury). It’s good in the mirror.


**First it was Copycat, then it was Vehicles, now it’s Black-Green; what’s next for *Aether Revolt* Standard?** I’m not familiar enough with the format to say.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** It’s a good way to close out a great weekend.

**Age:** 24


**Hometown:** Bentonville, Arkansas


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Grand Prix Montreal champion


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Black-green with four [Gifted Aetherborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifted+Aetherborn) because it has a great matchup against Mardu and other black-green decks.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Verdurous Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdurous+Gearhulk), not close. It’s very aggressive and hard to beat from behind.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** Lifecrafter’s Bestiary because it runs away with games on a stable board.


**First it was Copycat, then it was Vehicles, now it’s Black-Green; what’s next for *Aether Revolt* Standard?** Probably Four-Color Saheeli, it will be built optimally in time.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** Proof I’m not just a Limited player.

**Age:** 34


**Hometown:** Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Runner-up at Mr. Nice Guy’s World Championships 2017 (local store).


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Black-Green Energy. It tested well for me, and I actually enjoy playing this deck, unlike Copycat.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** In game one, it’s [Blossoming Defense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blossoming+Defense). After that, it’s [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar) or [Winding Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor) or [Walking Ballista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista) or [Glint-Sleeve Siphoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint-Sleeve+Siphoner)...


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** Lifecrafter’s Bestiary… how about that scry ability, eh?


**First it was Copycat, then it was Vehicles, now it’s Black-Green; what’s next for *Aether Revolt* Standard?** An [Elder Deep-Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Deep-Fiend) deck, maybe? Or a full circle back to [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel)?


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** I’m now qualified for the Pro Tour, so it’s quite the privilege and honor. Go Mr. Nice Guy Games!

**![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gppit17/t8_gervasi.jpg)Name:** Bronson Gervasi


**Age:** 22


**Hometown:** Amarillo, Texas


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Top-level local player back home.


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Mardu Vehicles. I asked for a lot of advice from a bunch of different friends and one friend told me, “if you want to Top 8, play Mardu Vehicles." So I did.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Unlicensed Disintegration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration). That card is amazing removal in an aggressive deck.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Selfless Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Spirit) or [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance). Both of them won games for me.


**First it was Copycat, then it was Vehicles, now it’s Black-Green; what’s next for *Aether Revolt* Standard?** I hope something changes, but I feel like these will be the top decks for the format unless a new control build comes out.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** I have accomplished one of my biggest goals in life today!

 **![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gppit17/t8_hare.jpg)Name:** Ryan Hare


**Age:** 26


**Hometown:** Syracuse, New York


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Two-time Game Day finalist, one-time Game Day Champion. SCG Premier IQ champion, Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* competitor.


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Black-green, because the deck is great and doesn’t ever let you draw bad cards. It’s well-positioned to beat Mardu with game against everything else.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Winding Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor). No step on snek! It has absurd synergies, and is a good rate in the best colors.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Distended Mindbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distended+Mindbender) against control - it’s extremely difficult to interact with and cripples control. No one ever plays around it.


**First it was Copycat, then it was Vehicles, now it’s Black-Green; what’s next for *Aether Revolt* Standard?** Still black-green, it’s pretty great.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** It means that I placed in the Top 8 of this event. It means I get my second Pro Tour appearance and that I’m very pleased with my performance.

 **![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gppit17/t8_fournier.jpg)Name:** Daniel Fournier


**Age:** 24


**Hometown:** Toronto, Ontario


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Two Grand Prix Top 8s, two SCG Top 8s, dead last at the World *Magic* Cup in 2014.


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Jeskai Copycat, because wise seer Omar Beldon told me it would crush black-green decks. Least-known Platinum Pro Paul Dean tried to hook me with [Dynavolt Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dynavolt+Tower) garbage, but I’m not falling for that again.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk). Oversized [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) is lit.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** I put the third [Disallow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disallow) in the board, then played black-green 11 times. Oops.


**First it was Copycat, then it was Vehicles, now it’s Black-Green; what’s next for *Aether Revolt* Standard?** What? It’s black-green now? I beg to differ. Hopefully Jund [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers) is the next best deck. That would be fun.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** I means a chance to get back on the Pro Tour, which is great, but mostly it gives me the scoreboard on Edgar Magalhaes. Thanks to Chris Ha for the drive.

**Age:** 26


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** SCG Invitational Top 8


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** I played Mardu Vehicles because it dominated the Pro Tour and I had the cards.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Unlicensed Disintegration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration) - it gives great reach.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Fatal Push](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Push) - the tempo gain is too good.


**First it was Copycat, then it was Vehicles, now it’s Black-Green; what’s next for *Aether Revolt* Standard?** [Elder Deep-Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Deep-Fiend).


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** Solid accomplishment. It’s lit.
