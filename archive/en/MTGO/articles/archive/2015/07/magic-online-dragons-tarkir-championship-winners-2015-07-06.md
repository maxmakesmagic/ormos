SaucyPizza opened some very nice green and white bombs—so many in fact that the final deck list ended up at 41 cards. With a plethora of ways to bolster and get +1/+1 counters onto creatures, SaucyPizza ended up with a rather ideal Dromoka deck.



Littledarwin's deck relied more heavily on removal than SaucyPizza's, making good use of a lot of red and black instants. Two copies of [Dutiful Attendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dutiful+Attendant) and a [Monastery Loremaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Loremaster) also allowed littledarwin to reuse several "enter the battlefield" effects, like the ones on [Swift Warkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swift+Warkite) and [Merciless Executioner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merciless+Executioner).


Did SaucyPizza bolster to victory? Did littledarwin's deck have enough removal to keep SaucyPizza's creatures at bay and combo to victory? Read on to see who won the championship title!


**Game One**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-1_Turn-3.png)


SaucyPizza got off to a nice start thanks to [Sandsteppe Outcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandsteppe+Outcast) and his Spirit sidekick. Luckily, littledarwin already had a key component of the combo machine on the field: [Shambling Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Goblin). By casting [Merciless Executioner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merciless+Executioner) and sacrificing [Shambling Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Goblin), littledarwin was able to force SaucyPizza to sacrifice the Spirit token. Regardless of which creature was chosen, both of SaucyPizza's creatures only had one toughness, so the [Sandsteppe Outcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandsteppe+Outcast) also fell to littledarwin's [Shambling Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Goblin).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-1_Turn-5.png)


Unfortunately for littledarwin, the lone [Merciless Executioner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merciless+Executioner) looked less impressive two turns later once SaucyPizza was able to get two big threats onto the field: [Daghatar the Adamant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daghatar+the+Adamant) and [Arashin Foremost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashin+Foremost). To make matters worse for littledarwin, [Arashin Foremost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashin+Foremost) entered the battlefield after [Daghatar the Adamant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daghatar+the+Adamant), giving [Daghatar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=391815) double strike. With [Merciless Executioner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merciless+Executioner) tapped, littledarwin was able to get in 8 points of damage.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-1_Turn-5-2.png)


With the ability to move +1/+1 counters around at will, littledarwin decided [Daghatar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=391815) was too dangerous and used [Sarkhan's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%27s+Rage) to destroy it.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-1_Turn-6.png)


On turn six, SaucyPizza attacked with [Arashin Foremost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashin+Foremost) and a manifest creature. Littledarwin moved to trade with [Merciless Executioner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merciless+Executioner). But wait. SaucyPizza starts tapping lands.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-1_Turn-6-2.png)


Oh no! It was a cleverly disguised [Feral Krushok](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Krushok) all along.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-1_Turn-7.png)


Once the huge green Beast was on the field, all it took was a [Silkwrap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silkwrap) on littledarwin's sole defense to seal the win.


**Game Two**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-2_Turn-3.png)


Game Two started out a bit slower than Game One. By turn three, more than half the creatures on the field were morphs, and not much damage had been done—SaucyPizza managed to deal 3 damage with the [Dromoka Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka+Warrior).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-2_Turn-4-2.png)


Littledarwin attacked with a morph creature, which was then blocked by SaucyPizza's morph. Lands tapped and littledarwin's morph flipped to reveal itself as an [Atarka Efreet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka+Efreet). It was a pretty slick maneuver, resulting in the creatures trading in combat and [Atarka Efreet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka+Efreet) pinging the [Dromoka Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka+Warrior) for one damage, destroying it.


Littledarwin's turn ended with a field devoid of creatures. Depending on what SaucyPizza had in-hand, the tide might have turned in Pizza's favor.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-2_Turn-4-3.png)


[Ojutai Exemplars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai+Exemplars) was a pretty good card to have in-hand. After the [Exemplars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394638) landed on the scene, the turn passed to littledarwin. In an attempt to prepare for the bomb that had just landed on the field in the form of three exercising monks, littledarwin used [Tormenting Voice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormenting+Voice), discarding [Dutiful Attendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dutiful+Attendant) and drawing two cards. To get some mana ramp and/or a creature in a pinch, littledarwin also played a [Kolaghan Monument](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan+Monument).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-2_Turn-5.png)


The [Exemplars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394638) began to do what they do best: select great effects from a bulleted list every time SaucyPizza cast a spell. [Soul Summons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Summons) allowed the [Exemplars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394638) to gain first strike and lifelink until end of turn. SaucyPizza attacked with the [Exemplars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394638), regaining 4 life.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-2_Turn-6.png)


Littledarwin cast [Sarkhan's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%27s+Rage) to take out the [Ojutai Exemplars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai+Exemplars) and passed the turn. SaucyPizza responded by bolstering the [Lightwalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightwalker), giving it flying in the process. After that, Saucy attacked with everything for 7, bringing littledarwin's life total down to 5.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-2_Turn-7.png)


At the beginning of turn seven, littledarwin's deck began to show off its combo potential. [Swift Warkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swift+Warkite)'s ability allowed littledarwin to return [Dutiful Attendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dutiful+Attendant) to the battlefield and attack with it.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-2_Turn-8.png)


SaucyPizza attacked with [Lightwalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightwalker), forcing littledarwin to trade [Swift Warkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swift+Warkite) to stay in the game. SaucyPizza cast [Wildcall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildcall) for two mana, to manifest and put two +1/+1 counters onto the new manifest creature.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-2_Turn-9.png)


Littledarwin responded by using Draconic Roar to destroy the 2/2 Manifest, then cast [Dutiful Attendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dutiful+Attendant) and [Merciless Executioner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merciless+Executioner), allowing littledarwin to sacrifice the [Attendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394561) to retrieve [Swift Warkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swift+Warkite) from the graveyard.


SaucyPizza cast a morph creature face down and passed the turn. Littledarwin continued to combo by playing the retrieved [Swift Warkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swift+Warkite), and returning [Dutiful Attendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dutiful+Attendant) to the battlefield.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-2_Turn-9-2.png)


If littledarwin had gotten the combo machine going quicker, it may have won the game. SaucyPizza was just too far ahead and played the card needed to win the game: [Den Protector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector). With [Den Protector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) on the field, SaucyPizza was able to grab [Cached Defenses](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cached+Defenses) from the graveyard, bolster [Den Protector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) for three, and attack.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Limited_Game-2_Final-Board.png)


Since creatures with less power than [Den Protector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) can't block it, nothing stood in the way of SaucyPizza winning the match.

**Matter\_Mixer**


![](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/Red_Mana.png)![](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/Green_Mana.png)




---

Fastfake played a quick Abzan Aggro deck meant to clear threats out with [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), then clean up with devastating creatures like [Siege Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and [Warden of the First Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree).


Matter\_Mixer played a Green-Red Devotion deck with the aim of ramping into huge threats like [Polukranos, World Eater](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) and [Dragonlord Atarka](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka).


Both competitors in the Standard Championship Finals aimed to win the game with some terrifyingly strong creatures. Did Matter\_Mixer steam roll Fastfake by ramping into threatening green creatures, or was Fastfake's removal enough to stop Matter\_Mixer's deck in its tracks? Read on to find out!


**Game One**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-1_Turn-2.png)


Fastfake ended turn two in pretty great shape, [Thoughtseizing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373632) a [Whisperwood Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) from Matter\_Mixer and casting [Warden of The First Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+The+First+Tree) to add insult to injury.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-1_Turn-3.png)


Matter\_Mixer cast a [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), buying some time and mana ramp with the hexproof defender.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-1_Turn-3-2.png)


With no real threats on the field yet, Fastfake attacked into Matter\_Mixer's two creatures with [Warden of the First Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree) (a 3/3 Human Warrior thanks to its first ability). Seemingly in need of the mana generation, Matter\_Mixer declared no blockers and took 3 damage, dropping to 17 life. Fastfake cast a second [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) and fetched a Forest with [Wooded Foothills](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Foothills). Again, Fastfake attacked into the growing group of [Caryatids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373624), and Matter\_Mixer continued to hold back blockers. It would seem that Matter\_Mixer was biding time, waiting to use all of that mana for something big.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-1_Turn-4.png)


It began to look like Matter\_Mixer was experiencing quite the opposite, however. Despite scrying with multiple [Temple of Abandon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Abandon)s, nothing dropped onto the field that threatened [Warden of the First Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-1_Turn-5.png)


Without a creature to pour green mana into, and with Fastfake pumping the [Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=391954) with a combination of [Abzan Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm)s and its own abilities, the match was over before it had much of a chance to begin.


**Game Two**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-2.png)


In Game Two, Matter\_Mixer played first and started the match out exactly the way Green-Red Devotion wants to: with an [[autocard]Elvish Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%5Bautocard%5DElvish+Mystic) on the field. With a match completed, Fastfake knew that Matter\_Mixer was bringing lots of green creatures and had sideboarded in some [[autocard]Self-Inflicted Wound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%5Bautocard%5DSelf-Inflicted+Wound)s to deal with them.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-23.png)


Matter\_Mixer didn't skip a beat after losing the [Elvish Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic). By unmorphing a [Rattleclaw Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic), Mixer was able to cast both a [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) and another [Elvish Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) with only two Forests on the field. With a potential for six mana on turn three, Matter\_Mixer was in a promising place.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-3-2.png)


Unfortunately, Fastfake was doing a good job of [Thoughtseizing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373632) anything away that Matter\_Mixer might use that mana for, like [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon). [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) also made an appearance. Matter\_Mixer only had a few more turns before the [Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373562) would become monstrous and be much harder to deal with.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-4.png)


Matter\_Mixer was finally able to wade through the sea of removal to cast [Polukranos, World Eater](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater). If [Polukranos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373549) could make it one more turn, it could become monstrous and clear the board, getting rid of the troublesome [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), and setting up Matter\_Mixer for a devastating attack. . .


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-4-2.png)


. . .but Fastfake had an [Ultimate Price](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-5.png)


While it wasn't a [Polukranos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373549), the newly cast [Arbor Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus) would be able to do some damage if it managed to stay on the field for long.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-6.png)


The [Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373740) became monstrous mid-attack, swinging in for 9 damage. Fastfake took the hit, dropping to 7 life. With Matter\_Mixer at 10 life (after taking a hit from [Warden of the First Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree)) and Fastfake at 7, it was looking like a close match.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-7.png)


Things were looking promising for Matter\_Mixer as a [Xenagos, the Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) resolved.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-7-2.png)


Fastfake made the [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) monstrous in order to soak up an attack from [Arbor Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus), but [Rattleclaw Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) and a hasty Satyr were able to make it through for 4 damage, bringing Fastfake to 3 life.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-7-3.png)


Luckily, the [Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=391954) has a lot of potential for life gain.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-7-4.png)


With a well-timed [Dromoka's Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command), the [Rattleclaw Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) was forced to fight [Warden of the First Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree). With the [Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=391954) already in combat with [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), both creatures were destroyed, and Fastfake gained 8 life from the exchange.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-9.png)


Fastfake would still have to get through for 10 damage for a win. With Matter\_Mixer's ever-growing army of Satyrs, it was getting to be a more difficult proposition by the turn.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-10.png)


The longer the match went, the bigger the [Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=391954) was able to grow. With so much life gain potential, a finishing blow from Matter\_Mixer was looking less and less likely.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-10-2.png)


With this in mind, Matter\_Mixer moved to destroy the [Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=391954), then rebuild the Satyr army with [Xenagos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373502).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-10-3.png)


But the [Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=391954) grew bigger still!


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/Standard_Game-2_Turn-11.png)


Matter\_Mixer cast [Whisperwood Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental), which was quickly destroyed by [Self-Inflicting Wound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Self-Inflicting+Wound).
