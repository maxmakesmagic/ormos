As April comes to a close, it's time for our latest look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. With no Premier Events on the schedule last weekend, our Top 25 remains intact. For those of you who drop in every month or so, you'd be forgiven for expecting business as usual, with Owen Turtenwald sitting on top of affairs as he has done for much of the year. As we head into May, however, Turtenwald is at No. 3. Ahead of him is the hugely impressive Sam Black, who continues to churn out excellent results while also enhancing his reputation as one of the great thinkers of the modern game. Black is only a hair above Turtenwald at No. 2, but the recent change at the very top of the standings is down to Eric Froehlich.



Ironically, Froehlich's dominance is something we might have seen five years ago had things worked out a little differently. Platinum Pro status was a single win away for him, during the Top 8 of Worlds 2010 in Chiba, Japan. His quarterfinal loss jeopardized his *Magic* future, and he spent a couple of years in the wilderness, working hard to improve his game and return fully to the Pro fold. Since doing so, he has become a mainstay of ChannelFireball, one of the most respected players on the circuit, the current No. 1 in the rankings, and a player who is sure to be on an awful lot of shortlists for the Hall of Fame ballots later in the summer.



Sitting just behind the three Americans who head the chart, former No. 1 Lee Shi Tian is within 3 points of reclaiming the top spot, meaning that every Grand Prix weekend really counts, and May is a truly blockbuster month. We kick off with Sao Paulo and Toronto this weekend. Seven days on, and it's Atlantic City and Paris. Keep on travelling, because the next week we have Florence and Shanghai. Finally, at the end of the month, the tripleheader that's going to make *Magic* historyâ€”there's Las Vegas, Utrecht, and Chiba, all sporting the *Modern Masters 2015* format, and all guaranteed to be an amazing spectacle.



Can Eric Froehlich emerge from May still in the No. 1 spot? You know where to come to find out.
