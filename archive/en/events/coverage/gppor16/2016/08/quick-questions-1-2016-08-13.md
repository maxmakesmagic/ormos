It's an issue on which we all must choose a side. Emrakul and zombies cannot peaceably cohabitate on Innistrad - well, nothing can peaceably cohabitate with Emrakul - and so we have to pick. Liliana, or Emrakul? We pulled several pros aside and put the question to them.

I'm going to say Emrakul. I love doing the [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) thing, it's one of my favorite things. I like to find all the weird lines, the combinations where you can maximize how much damage you do to your opponent.

Emrakul. It's bigger, it's flashier, you get to take their turn, which is awesome. You just get to play more Magic.

Emrakul, I've gotta say. Liliana's kind of delusion in this story. She's powerful, but she's a narcissist that gives narcissists a bad name. Emrakul's kind of pure. I don't know if you've read what they wrote in the story, but Emrakul actually just won. Things played out the way Emrakul wanted. Liliana was just standing there while Emrakul appeared to lose, but it was very clearly what Emrakul wanted to have happen right now.

Emrakul. It costs thirteen mana.

Liliana, because Liliana is totally, totally awesome. You can absolutely shut people down right from turn three in some cases. At the finals [of PT Eldritch Moon], what did Lukas do? [Overwhelm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelm)ed all of the Emrakuls. So Liliana, definitely.


### **Andrew Brown**

Neither. Liliana - the means to her ends I'm not exactly down with and Emrakul, she ends the game too fast. I like to play with my food before finishing, you know?
