The "blue [Hurricane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurricane)" is one of the rarest **Magic** cards on Earth.

It was printed—in error—as part of a special reprinting of the *Revised* edition in 1994 (called "Summer **Magic**").

The set was never formally released, but a few cases of it were accidentally shipped to England. Copies of this card go for hundreds of dollars on the secondary market.
