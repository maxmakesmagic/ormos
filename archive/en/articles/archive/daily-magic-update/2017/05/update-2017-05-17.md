The May 17, 2017 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on May 17, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by Nicol Bolas doing that thing where you stick your thumbs in your ears and wag your hands back and forth saying "nana, nana, boo, boo."


Today's Must
============


1. [7 Decks That Didn't Make the Cut for Pro Tour *Amonkhet*](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/7-decks-that-didnt-make-the-cut-for-pro-tour-amonkhet/) | Channel Fireball | Pascal Maynard

My favorite part of the week after the Pro Tour is the plethora of "didn't quite make it" decklists that start coming out. Today's [Deck of the Day](#10) is one of them, and Maynard has seven distinct ones for you today, all of various levels of playability. Most of them are perfectly playable at a Friday Night *Magic* level, so I know I'll be giving a few of them a spin. Probably the ones with blue cards.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [MtA Episode 225: Pro Tour SMASHville](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-episode-225-pro-tour-smashville/) | Magic the Amateuring | Meghan Wolff and Maria Bartholdi

Meghan and Maria both traveled to the Pro Tour this past weekend and ate a bunch of hot chicken. Also the Pro Tour happened.


By the way, I might have heard more about hot chicken over the past week than I did about [Aetherworks Marvel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel). I don't know what I expect you to do with that information, but it struck me as odd.


1. [Pro Tour Testing with Donald Smith](http://www.constructedcriticism.com/podcasts/constructed-criticism-185-pro-tour-testing-with-donald-smith/) | Constructed Criticism | Spencer Howland and Michael Hinderacker

Donald Smith of team Lingering Souls ([currently in 4th place](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/protour/teamseries/2016-17-leaderboard)!) had a rough Pro Tour, but his team, and the deck he brought to battle—White-Black Zombies—certainly didn't. Hear all about his testing process and what got them to bring one of the breakout decks of the tournament.


1. [Commander VS: More Random Planeswalkers!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35123_Commander-VS-More-Random-Planeswalkers.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

No, but, like, seriously—what if planeswalkers could be commanders? Like, for real. Again.


The Commander VS crew looks to answer that question (again) with four more Commander decks built around planeswalkers. This time [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), [Arlinn Kord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arlinn+Kord), and [Venser, the Sojourner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+the+Sojourner) join the fray.


You get exactly one guess which deck is my favorite.


1. [Breaking Boros—Winning With Red-White In EDH](https://collected.company/2017/05/16/breaking-boros-winning-redwhite-edh-158/) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

I've heard of people winning with Boros Commander decks, but I've never seen it. Jimmy and Josh go full-on "destroy all the things" to make it viable, and give you tips and tricks on how to make the deck work. Though if you've got to go full on [Razia's Purification](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razia%27s+Purification), there's just no turning back.


1. [Jimmy Wong](https://kitchentablemagic.org/2017/05/16/jimmy-wong-ep-217/) | Kitchen Table Magic | Sam Tang

If you can't get enough Jimmy Wong, Kitchen Table Magic has you covered. Sam Tang interviews the Command Zone Podcast co-host on content, acting, and, naturally, *Magic*.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. Magic Mics | Reuben Bresler, Evan Erwin, and Erin Campbell | [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics) | 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT/3 a.m. UTC

The Pro Tour will of course be on everyone's minds, but yesterday's news about Hélène Bergeot will certainly make the cut as well. After that, Evan will talk about how to make the perfect pierogi. Probably. I'm guessing on that one.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

Hélène made a tremendous impact on *Magic* in her over 20 years at Wizards, and we wish her the best in her next endeavor. I'll always remember my daily French lessons that came from her speaking her native language to another executive who *also* happened to be French and also happened to have an office very near where I work. Au revoir!

Well done, Caleb. Durward is doing a year of daily streaming, and he crossed 300 straight days just yesterday. You can check out the video of [his 300th straight stream here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/144440544).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Michael Majors's Pieces of the Splendid Shore](https://twitter.com/MichaelJMajors/status/864480853392601088)

Thanks to the investigative journalism of Brian David-Marshall (as in, he asked nicely), Michael Majors [shared his backup deck for the Pro Tour on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MichaelJMajors/status/864480853392601088) the other day, and it was an intensely interesting deck. Combining pieces of the [Torrential Gearhulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk)/[Engulf the Shore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore)s decks that have floated around *Magic Online* with a [Splendid Reclamation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splendid+Reclamation) engine, Majors said he just couldn't quite get the deck there prior to the Pro Tour.


In the interim, BDM and I have taken it upon ourselves to play the deck as much as possible, and the deck is legit. It's missing *something*, but it's really cool when it does its thing—its thing being dumping a bunch of lands into the graveyard and then bringing them all back at once, letting you leverage Ulamog, [World Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker), and, importantly, [Commit // Memory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commit+%2F%2F+Memory).


The deck churns through itself quickly thanks to [Contingency Plan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contingency+Plan) and [Pieces of the Puzzle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pieces+of+the+Puzzle), both of which also make the deck ultra-consistent in doing its thing. The [Kozilek's Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return)s are a nice touch, as dumping them in the graveyard can actually be a boon. [Engulf the Shore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore) and [Haze of Pollen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haze+of+Pollen) buy time to "go off," and then further hold back the board until an Eldrazi can bat cleanup.


Both BDM and I thought the deck needed a little more oomph and that the [Censor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Censor)s were a bit weak, so we dropped all four of them for two [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)s, one (additional) [World Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker), and another [Kozilek's Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return). That, in turn, let us upgrade the sideboard with more [Dispel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel)s and a [Sphinx of the Final Word](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+the+Final+Word), as control was proving to be both difficult *and* everywhere on *Magic Online.*


Majors's decklist is preserved below, because what the heck to BDM and I know? But it's a really cool idea that definitely has some legs.
