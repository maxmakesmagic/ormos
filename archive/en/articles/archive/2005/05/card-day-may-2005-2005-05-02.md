**Card of the Day - mardi 31 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Agonizing%20Memories)#### Agonizing Memories


*Weatherlight* uncommon. Inspired by Painful Memories from *Mirage*, this card was named by the simple question "what's worse than ‘painful’?" No comment yet on whether you can expect to see "Excruciating Memories" in a future set. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 27 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shield%20of%20Kaldra)#### Shield of Kaldra


*Darksteel* rare. The *Mirrodin* block prerelease cards are remarkable for several reasons. First, they are the first block to feature alternate art on each of the prerelease promo versions (something that has continued through Kamigawa block). Second, they are the first prerelease cards to be non-creatures. Finally, Shield of Kaldra is the first **Magic** card to reference a card that hadn’t even been printed yet! (Click here to see the *Mirrodin* block promo versions.) 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 26 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Stone-Tongue%20Basilisk)#### Stone-Tongue Basilisk


*Odyssey* rare. Following on the heels of the dead language *Invasion* block promo cards, this block featured cards printed in non-Roman scripts. The Basilisk is in Arabic, Laquatus's Champion is in Cyrillic, and Glory is printed with Hebrew text. (Click here to see the promo versions.) 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 25 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Raging%20Kavu)#### Raging Kavu


*Invasion* rare. The prerelease promos for *Invasion* block were printed in three different dead languages. Raging Kavu is in Latin, Questing Phelddagrif is in classical Greek, and Fungal Shambler is printed in Sanskrit! (Click here to see the promo versions.) 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 24 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lightning%20Dragon)#### Lightning Dragon


*Urza’s Saga* rare. The promo card from *Urza’s Saga*, Lightning Dragon was the first premium (foil) prerelease promo card. Foils weren’t available in booster packs until the next set, *Urza’s Legacy*. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 23 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dirtcowl%20Wurm)#### Dirtcowl Wurm


*Tempest* rare. *Tempest* was the first set to feature a special promotional card for prerelease competitors. The promo version of Dirtcowl Wurm features the word “Prerelease” and the **Magic** “M” stamped in gold leaf. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 20 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ivory%20Tower)#### Ivory Tower


*Antiquities* uncommon. One of the very best life-gaining cards ever printed, Ivory Tower's presence heavily influenced any formats it was legal in. After reading first World Champion Zak Dolan's diary of the event, it's no surprise that Betrand Lestree of France claimed this card single-handedly defeated him in the title match against Dolan!
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 19 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Multani,%20Maro-Sorcerer)#### Multani, Maro-Sorcerer


*Urza's Legacy* rare. All Maro-Sorcerers are avatars of specific forests. Multani is the avatar of the Yavimaya Forest. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 18 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gerrard's%20Wisdom)#### Gerrard's Wisdom


*Weatherlight* uncommon. Considering that the game is based on dueling mages, it's surprising that only two tournament-legal cards in **Magic** have ever referenced duels in their flavor text. (The other is the *Ice Age* version of Counterspell.)
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 17 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cursed%20Rack)#### Cursed Rack


*Antiquities* uncommon. Affectionately nicknamed “Stuffy” around the office, the unfortunate character on this card makes appearances on several other older cards as well. In fact, he shows up in such unlikely places that it's entirely possible we missed one or two! The other ones we were able to find were: The Rack, Black Vise, Leshrac's Rite, and Wall of Wonder.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 16 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=The%20Rack)#### The Rack


*Antiquities* uncommon. Of the 7,514 different **Magic** cards, only 12 start with “The”. You'd think cards starting with “The” would be singular in nature, but only 4 of them can't normally show up in play in multiples – The Abyss, The Lady of the Mountain, The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale, and The Unspeakable. (Though The Cheese Stands Alone would certainly *like* to be the only copy in play!)
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 13 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mending%20Hands)#### Mending Hands


*Betrayers of Kamigawa* common. Through some strange coincidence, 3 of the 7 cards with “hand” in their name involve the number 4 in their abilities. (The other two are Mending Hands and Initiates of the Ebon Hand, counting Oracle text.) A possible nod to hands having four fingers? You decide!
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 12 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Order%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Hand)#### Order of the Ebon Hand


*Fallen Empires* common. This (and its white version) redefined the power curve for two-casting cost creatures. Then *Ice Age* came along and added another version, which gave black and white access to 8 outstanding weenies before even going to White Knight or Black Knight. Collectively, these were referred to as the “pump knights” (even though the *Fallen Empires* versions were Clerics). 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 11 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hand%20to%20Hand)#### Hand to Hand


*Tempest* rare. The idea behind this card was to create attack phases where there were no surprises, just brute force fighting. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 10 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sleight%20of%20Hand)#### Sleight of Hand


*Seventh Edition* common. This card was first printed in *Portal Second Age*. Because that was a beginner’s set, there were no instants, just sorceries. Given other cards printed at the time, it’s possible this would have been instant had it appeared in an expert set instead! 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 9 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Initiates%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Hand)#### Initiates of the Ebon Hand


*Fallen Empires* common. Though variations on washing mana were quite common for black in **Magic**’s earlier days, this ability has become considerably more uncommon in recent years. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 6 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Erhnam%20Djinn)#### Erhnam Djinn


*Judgment* rare. It can be safely assumed that Erhnam is married to the Ifh-Biff Efreet, since they were named after Richard Garfield's sister Elizabeth (who, when she was young, couldn't pronounce her name) and her husband Herman (anagram of Erhnam).
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 5 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goblin%20Warchief)#### Goblin Warchief


*Scourge* uncommon. This ability was inspired by the cycle of Familiars in Planeshift, which were in turn inspired by the Medallions in Tempest. The Medallions were inspired by Stone Calendar from *The Dark*.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 4 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Grinning%20Demon)#### Grinning Demon


*Onslaught* rare. The name of this happy little fellow (as well as the return of Demons to Magic) was snuck out in the August 2 Ask Wizards .
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 3 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Prodigal%20Sorcerer)#### Prodigal Sorcerer


*Alpha* common. After being in the base set for seven editions, this ability finally left blue; the replacement in Eighth Edition was Anaba Shaman.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 2 mai 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Serra%20Angel)#### Serra Angel


*Eighth Edition* rare. The name "Serra" was chosen to evoke "serrated"; Richard Garfield wanted a name that would imply a warrior.
