This week's "Sketches" focuses on one of the new "Symbiotic" creatures from *Onslaught*, [Symbiotic Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Beast) by Franz Vohwinkel.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Location: Wirewood Forest  
 Action: large forest Beast that has four big centipedes as its 'hair.'  
 Notes: Insect Token Cycle. Don't forget the bonespurs."

Because all the Symbiotic creatures produce Insect tokens when they die, all their illustrations feature centipedes prominently. (Yes, in the fantastic multiverse of **Magic**, centipedes are Insects.)

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Franz. The Beast itself was fine, but the fighter in the corner had to go. He looked like something out of Camelot rather than Otaria.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. The fighter has been removed.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as it appears in the set.
