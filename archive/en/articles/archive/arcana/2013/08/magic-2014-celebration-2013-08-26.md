The time has come once again to celebrate with new players as part of the core set's celebration! You can enjoy an event courtesy of Wizards of the Coast at your favorite participating WPN store!

**Magic** Celebration is happening worldwide on September 7, 2013! Check out our [event locator](http://locator.wizards.com) to find an event near you. You should contact your local store to confirm its participation and the event venue location (in case they're holding it in another venue space).

Each **Magic** Celebration player receives one ***Magic** 2014* Core Set booster pack\* and achievement card\*. After opening your booster pack, you'll choose a ***Magic** 2014* Core Set Sample Deck\* to add cards from your booster pack to.

\* - While supplies last.

For those of you who haven't attended **Magic** Celebration before, it is a special format event.

To play, you open your booster pack and choose a color of cards from your booster you want to play. Then, ask the tournament organizer for a ***Magic** 2014* Core Set Sample Deck of that color to use as the rest of your deck. Shuffle the cards you want to play from your booster pack into your sample deck and play three best-of-three matches with different opponents.

When you've played all of your matches, show your completed score card (on the back of your achievement card) to the tournament organizer to receive an additional ***Magic** 2014* Core Set booster pack as a prize!
