Steve Easton may be the first English player to play with magic cards, as he started playing at the Gen con, where Magic was first demo'ed. His first Pro Tour; Columbus back in the first year of the pro tour earned him a 28th place finish, playing a Counter post deck in Ice Age block constructed. Paul Willis has also had success on the pro tour, although he has been playing for a while, he made money in Kobe playing a speedy affinity deck which he also sports today (although the list is much different). The winner of this match will be guaranteed a spot in the top eight as these two players sit top of the Swiss, Steve has just won his last 6 rounds of draft making him tied for English Nationals draft champion with Sam Gomersall.


Paul is playing a fairly standard build of Affinity where as Steve Easton is playing [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) with red and [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness). 


Paul mu

![Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Eternal+Witness) lliganed and his start was very unimpressive two [Great Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace)s and an [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) were not very impressive when a pyroclasm hit. Interestingly Paul chose to sac both his lands to the ravager. He had plenty more land so whilst Steve developed his mana base and played small guys like [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) and [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) he was able to attack with an added cranial plate. Steve had a ton of mana available but was dead to one hit from the ravager, and with no actual spells he could carry on. On his last turn he made a potentially game costing mistake. He cast [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) with entwine targeting an artifact land rather than Paul's Glimmer Void, Paul sacrificed the land in response to the [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) and this meant Steve could cast his small blocker, this would have given him another draw to find a game winning [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail).
 Paul Willis leads 1-0


This time it was Steve who mulliganed he looked fairly short of mana, but had several artifact destruction spells in the form of [Oxidize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) and [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) and a pyroclasm slowed Steve down considerably. Even so a [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault), [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) and [Arcbound Worker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker) were gradually killing Steve. Eventually with Steve on 12 life he played an [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), Paul hit him to 9 and passed the turn. The following turn he cast [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager), which Steve allowed to resolve, although he realised this was a mistake shortly after, he was forced to blow the stone and when Paul sacrificed all his artifacts, the disciple ended the game.


Paul Willis wins 2-0 and is now almost guaranteed a spot in the top 8
