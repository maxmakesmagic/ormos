Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






Welcome to another week of *Kaladesh* previews here on DailyMTG. *Kaladesh* is already shaping up to be an exciting world that's sure to shake up Standard. Today, we'll be looking at a brand-new card that aggressive decks can use to punish opponents who are trying to contain them with removal spells.


We should be prepared for a very different Standard environment with *Dragons of Tarkir* and *Magic Origins* out of the mix. [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), a card that has all but defined the format for the last year, will begin its tenure as a Modern staple. Big monsters like [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End) and [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) will be closing games of classic battlecruiser-style *Magic*.


With [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) gone, a lot of players will be looking for a new way to apply quick pressure on opponents who are trying to do the biggest and baddest things in the format. Today's preview card leaves a lot of open-ended questions and is sure to be the backbone of many aggressive Standard strategies going forward.


Let's take a look at Scrapheap Scrounger!


![Scrapheap Scrounger](https://media.wizards.com/2016/bVvMNuiu2i_KLD/en_BLwKD4s25z.png)


First of all, this thing is a 3-power creature for two colorless mana. That's already very impressive. We're getting a great aggressive body for a very reasonable cost that we'll always be able to pay. What really pushes Scrapheap Scrounger over the top is its ability to repeatedly come back from the graveyard to apply a constant stream of pressure. The fact that Scrapheap Scrounger can be activated at instant speed means that it will be very effective at dealing with opposing planeswalkers while also punishing opponents who want to tap all of their mana to clear the board.


There are a lot of things we probably want to be doing with Scrapheap Scrounger. For example, [Luis Scott-Vargas's preview card](/node/1062681) from Friday, Unlicensed Disintegration, is an excellent way to kill any creature while also taking advantage of Scrapheap Scrounger being an artifact.

What I'm most excited about, though, is the chance to play Scrapheap Scrounger alongside [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam) to repeatedly flood the board with big threats that close the game fast. This is the type of card that really lets us use our graveyard as another hand, and I think it's worthwhile to see how far we can push its capabilities.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Prized+Amalgam)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam)
A card like Scrapheap Scrounger really gets the brewing cogs moving. The first deck I'd like to try to build with our newest toy is an aggressive strategy that dominates the midgame by flooding the board and finishing with [Decimator of the Provinces](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decimator+of+the+Provinces).


I don't think we want to be playing a ton of blue mana. We can splash a bit for the off chance we need to cast a [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam), but we're really trying to be a Black-Green deck. This way, we can use cards like [Noose Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noose+Constrictor), [Grapple with the Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapple+with+the+Past), and [Vessel of Nascency](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vessel+of+Nascency) to fill our graveyard in the most efficient ways possible.


Another card that I'm excited about trying in this type of deck is Ghirapur Orrery. Alongside [Noose Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noose+Constrictor), we can use Ghirapur Orrery to dump all of the awesome graveyard interaction we're working with into the bin before grabbing three new fresh ones every single turn. What's even more impressive is that the card should ramp our mana haphazardly into a place where we're decimating provinces and turning on [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate)s and [Hissing Quagmire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hissing+Quagmire)s to the point where those will be very impressive threats. The deck seems like it has all the makings of an aggressive strategy that never runs out of gas and has the ability to use its (often massive) graveyard as another hand.

This looks like a really strong deck, and I wouldn't be surprised if decks like this one ended up being major players in Standard with *Kaladesh*. We could get a bit greedier with our mana and try fitting a set of [Elder Deep-Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Deep-Fiend)s in the deck, but I'm not even sure that's necessary.


Scrapheap Scrounger is used to its fullest potential here. This deck benefits from applying early pressure and easily fills the graveyard with food. Once we're activating our Scrapyard Scrounger, we'll likely be flooding the board with [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam)s.


This is only scratching the surface of Scrapheap Scrounger's potential. The deck is sure to be a major player in a variety of decks going forward.
