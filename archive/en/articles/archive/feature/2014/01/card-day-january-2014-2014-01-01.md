 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 









![Nessian Demolok](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nessian+Demolok)
  
**[Nessian Demolok](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Demolok)** – *Born of the Gods*. From the [*Born of the Gods* Release Notes](/en/node/633841) : 
  The choice of whether to pay tribute is made as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. At that point, it's too late to respond to the creature spell. For example, in a multiplayer game, opponents won't know whether tribute will be paid or which opponent will be chosen to pay tribute or not when deciding whether to counter the creature spell. 





![Felhide Spiritbinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Felhide+Spiritbinder)
  
**[Felhide Spiritbinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felhide+Spiritbinder)** – *Born of the Gods*. From the [*Born of the Gods* Release Notes](/en/node/633841) : 
  Inspired abilities trigger no matter how the creature becomes untapped: by the turn-based action at the beginning of the untap step or by a spell or ability. If the inspired ability includes an optional cost, you decide whether to pay that cost as the ability resolves. You can do this even if the creature leaves the battlefield in response to the ability. 





![Marshmist Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Marshmist+Titan)
  
**[Marshmist Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marshmist+Titan)** – *Born of the Gods*. From the [*Born of the Gods* Release Notes](/en/node/633841) : 
  Your devotion to black is calculated when you determine Marshmist Titan's total cost, and that cost is locked in before any costs are paid. For example, if you control a creature with black mana symbols in its mana cost that can be sacrificed for mana, those mana symbols will count toward your devotion to black. You can then sacrifice that creature for mana to pay the reduced total cost. 





![Arbiter of the Ideal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arbiter+of+the+Ideal)
  
**[Arbiter of the Ideal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbiter+of+the+Ideal)** – *Born of the Gods*. From the [*Born of the Gods* Release Notes](/en/node/633841) : 
  The manifestation counter is a memory aid only. The permanent will continue to be an enchantment in addition to its other types even if that counter is removed. If you choose to not put the card onto the battlefield, or if the card isn't one of the listed types, it will remain on top of your library. (Note that revealing the card is not optional.) 





![Archetype of Courage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Archetype+of+Courage)
  
**[Archetype of Courage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype+of+Courage)** – *Born of the Gods*. From the [*Born of the Gods* Release Notes](/en/node/633841):
  The Archetype's second ability applies to each creature controlled by any of your opponents, no matter when it entered the battlefield. If you and an opponent each control the same Archetype, no creature controlled by any player will have the appropriate ability.

![Fortress Cyclops](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fortress+Cyclops)
  
**[Fortress Cyclops](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortress+Cyclops)** – *Gatecrash*. It's easy to assume that all Gruul are monosyllabic cretins of the ["Not Gruul? Then die!"](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Charm) persuasion. Not true! The Gruul quoted on this card, Nedja—as well as her [fellow shamans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&flavor=+%5BKroshkar%5D)—disproves that stereotype, as she is not only [relatively talkative](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&flavor=+%5BNedja%5D) but also rather eloquent. So be wary, lest you [underestimate the subtleties of the Gruul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary)! 
 


![Titan's Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Titan%27s+Strength)
  
**[Titan's Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titan%27s+Strength)** – *Theros*. In his [second card-by-card story article](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/theroses-are-red-and-white-blue-black-and-green-part-2-2013-10-07) for *Theros*, Mark Rosewater confirmed that, "yes, the art is a reference to [Sisyphus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus). He was a king who was a bad man forced to suffer in [Tartarus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus), the part of the underworld where bad people went to be creatively tortured. Sisyphus's punishment was having to push a giant boulder up a hill only to have it always roll back down as soon as he finished." 
 


![Pact of the Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pact+of+the+Titan)
  
**[Pact of the Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+the+Titan)** – *Future Sight*. The *Time Spiral* block played with the concept of time as it exists both in the Multiverse and within the game itself. One of the ways R&D played with time in *Future Sight* was with [a cycle of five Pacts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&name=+%5Bpact%5D&set=+%5B%22Future+Sight%22%5D) (a series of related cards; in this case, one in each color) that allowed you cast a spell one turn and pay for it (or lose the game!) the next. 
 


![Sigil of the Nayan Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sigil+of+the+Nayan+Gods)
  
**[Sigil of the Nayan Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Nayan+Gods)** – *Alara Reborn*. The Nayans sure love their fatties (i.e., big creatures), which they call "gods"—as can be seen in their use of the term both in [naming conventions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&+action=advanced&format=+%5B%22Shards+of+Alara+Block%22%5D&name=+%5Bgod%5D) and [when talking about](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&format=+%5B%22Shards+of+Alara+Block%22%5D&flavor=+%5Bgod%5D&name=+!%5Bterminate%5D) huge monsters. This is reflected in the game itself by [their multiple interactions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&format=+%5B%22Shards+of+Alara+Block%22%5D&text=+%5Bpower%5D+%5B5%5D+%5Bgreater%5D) with creatures with [power 5 or greater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&format=+%5B%22Shards+of+Alara+Block%22%5D&power=+%3E%3d%5B5%5D&color=+!%5BB%5D+!%5BU%5D). 
 


![Sun Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sun+Titan)
  
**[Sun Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan)** – ***Magic** 2011* . There are currently [5,901 permanents with converted casting cost 3 or less](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&cmc=+%3C=%5B3%5D&type=+!%5B%22Instant%22%5D+!%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D&format=+!%5B%22Un-Sets%22%5D). Of those, [2,233 are white or colorless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&cmc=+%3C=%5B3%5D&format=+!%5B%22Un-Sets%22%5D&color=+@%28%7C%5BW%5D%7C%5BC%5D%29&type=+!%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D+!%5B%22Instant%22%5D) (or [1,757 nonland permanents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&cmc=+%3C=%5B3%5D&format=+!%5B%22Un-Sets%22%5D&color=+@%28%7C%5BW%5D%7C%5BC%5D%29&type=+!%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D+!%5B%22Instant%22%5D+!%5B%22Land%22%5D)). More breakdowns: [4,006 for Bant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&cmc=+%3C=%5B3%5D&format=+!%5B%22Un-Sets%22%5D&type=+!%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D+!%5B%22Instant%22%5D&color=+@%28+%5BG%5D%7C%5BW%5D%7C%5BB%5D%7C%5BC%5D%29), [3,963 for Esper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&cmc=+%3C=%5B3%5D&format=+!%5B%22Un-Sets%22%5D&type=+!%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D+!%5B%22Instant%22%5D&color=+@%28+%5BW%5D%7C%5BU%5D%7C%5BB%5D%7C%5BC%5D%29), and [4,001 for Naya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&cmc=+%3C=%5B3%5D&format=+!%5B%22Un-Sets%22%5D&type=+!%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D+!%5B%22Instant%22%5D&color=+@%28+%5BR%5D%7C%5BG%5D%7C%5BW%5D%7C%5BC%5D%29); [3,928 for the white wedge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&cmc=+%3C=%5B3%5D&format=+!%5B%22Un-Sets%22%5D&type=+!%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D+!%5B%22Instant%22%5D&color=+@%28+%5BW%5D%7C%5BB%5D%7C%5BR%5D%7C%5BC%5D%29), [4,006 for the black wedge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&cmc=+%3C=%5B3%5D&format=+!%5B%22Un-Sets%22%5D&type=+!%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D+!%5B%22Instant%22%5D&color=+@%28+%5BB%5D%7C%5BG%5D%7C%5BW%5D%7C%5BC%5D%29), and [3,911 for the red wedge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&cmc=+%3C=%5B3%5D&format=+!%5B%22Un-Sets%22%5D&type=+!%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D+!%5B%22Instant%22%5D&color=+@%28+%5BR%5D%7C%5BW%5D%7C%5BU%5D%7C%5BC%5D%29). 
 


![3](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=3)
  
**[Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3)** – *Limited Edition* Alpha. For 20th Anniversary Week, we asked R&D for the most important cards in **Magic**'s history. What better way to end the week than with some [Power](/en/articles/archive/power-nine-2003-10-15-0)? James Sooy picked [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3), calling it "the icon of legendary cards among all card games." 
 


![23106](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=23106)
  
**[Kavu Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Titan)** – *Invasion*. For 20th Anniversary Week, we asked R&D for the most important cards in **Magic**'s history. Ken Nagle chose [Kavu Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Titan) and explained by saying, "[it] began a crusade to make green creatures stronger." It climaxed in *Odyssey* with [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla), [Call of the Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd), [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm), and [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) showcasing that, yes, it's possible for green to have the best creatures. 
 


![2478](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2478)
  
**[Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2478)** – *Ice Age*. For 20th Anniversary Week, we asked R&D for the most important cards in **Magic**'s history. James Sooy and Worth Wollpert both picked [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2478). James explained his choice by calling it "the original boogeyman of Constructed tournaments."
