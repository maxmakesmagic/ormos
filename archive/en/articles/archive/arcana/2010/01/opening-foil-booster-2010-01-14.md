The all-foil *Shards of Alara* block booster packs went on sale last Friday (for only $11.99), and we thought it would be a good use of our time to show you exactly what's inside one.

Wait. That's what's *outside* one. When you open this up, you get this:

For fans of Raymond Swanland and booster packaging, here's a close-up.

Okay. This is an actual, unretouched booster, Let's crack it open and see what we get!

Okay. We got a rules tip card (not foil), a basic land, one rare, three uncommons, and ten commons. The rare is [Sovereigns of Lost Alara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara), although that [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) makes the uncommons more interesting. There are eight cards from *Shards of Alara* (counting the [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)), three from *Conflux*, and four from *Alara Reborn*. That's just what's in this pack; contents of packs may vary.

If you can't make them out, the complete contents of this particular booster are: a non-foil Rules Tip card (so *that's* how Domain works!), [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Sovereigns of Lost Alara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara), [Ancient Ziggurat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Ziggurat), [Rhox Charger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+Charger), [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), [Rhox Brute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+Brute), [Sanctum Plowbeast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+Plowbeast), [Exploding Borders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exploding+Borders), [Drag Down](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drag+Down), [Gustrider Exuberant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustrider+Exuberant), [Dregscape Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dregscape+Zombie), [Jhessian Lookout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhessian+Lookout), [Sanctum Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+Gargoyle), [Savage Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Hunger), and [Grixis Panorama](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grixis+Panorama). And as a side note, you can just mouse over those card names to see the card image.

Now for the important question: if this were an all-foil draft, what would we pick? Well, we love Esper, so we're kind of leaning toward the [Sanctum Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+Gargoyle) and trying for an Esper deck. A *shiny* Esper deck. But it might make more sense to grab the [Rhox Charger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+Charger). Or the [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf). What's *your* pick?
