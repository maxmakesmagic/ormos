You know when you have the beginnings of an idea but it isn't quite finished? You just sort of sit and chew on it for a while, looking for the missing pieces to finish it out. That's what today's Arcana was for a few weeks.


For my own Facebook header I find myself often leaning towards text on images, whether humorous or inspirational. So I began wondering if there was a possibility of doing this for **Magic** using the awesome art and flavor text from cards.


I talked the idea over with Bonnie (who you might remember from her awesome "[Missing Piec s](/en/articles/archive/missing-piec-s-2013-04-29)" Arcana last week.) She is our primary graphic artist for DailyMTG, and together we came up with the idea of doing this with the new Ravnica shocklands.


With that idea, Bonnie went off and did her graphical wizardry, coming back later with these fantastic Facebook headers. She had gone a step further and used the font from the guild welcome letters in the Prerelease packs at *Return to Ravnica* and *Gatecrash*.
