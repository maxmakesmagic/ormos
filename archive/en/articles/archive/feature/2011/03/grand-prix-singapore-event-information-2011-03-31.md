### Artist Information


**Daarken**


In the early years of his youth, Daarken attended the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. Most of his days were spent huddled over a sketchbook at a figure drawing workshop or in a cafe, where he was affectionately known as “the guy that likes to draw deltoids.” After three long years of drawing deltoids and video game playing, Daarken graduated Cum Laude with a BFA in traditional illustration. 


Daarken began his career in 2004 when his incessant video game playing was interrupted by a phone call. The mysterious voice on the other end identified himself as someone from Wizards of the Coast. Daarken immediately blurted out that he would like to work for them. His overzealous nature was countered with the statement “but you haven’t even heard what the project is yet.” And so began the lifestyle of creating monsters and zombies, with the occasional video game playing on the side. 


Daarken’s true video game playing powers were put to the test when he was hired by Mythic Entertainment in 2007 as a concept artist for Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning. His two loves combined into a gigantic ball of awesomeness, which he happily rolls around all day. He now spends his days freelancing full-time, creating monsters and zombies and, of course, playing more video games.
