Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






Urza—mastermind, foe of Phyrexia, not really a good guy in the big scheme of things, definitely a bossy jerk—finally has his own planeswalker card.

[AskUrza.com](http://www.askurza.com/)? Say what now?


Urza is getting powered up now, but I have it on good authority (namely his) that he will be ready to dole out abilities as soon as *Unstable* is released on December 8. Head (heh) to the site now to get a feel for how it'll all come together when the set releases and Urza, Academy Headmaster rolls into your lap.
