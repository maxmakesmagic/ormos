You might remember that a few weeks ago we were going to run the **Magic** Online [Wide Beta Spotlight](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/06042013c). We decided to reschedule it to allow our developers more time to address some issues in the client. Well now it's back, and it's today after we return from the standard downtime for **Magic**  Online.


From the point when we return from downtime to 10:00am PDT on Thursday, June 13, 2013, players will only be able to use the new Wide Beta client to play **Magic**  Online.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feat244c_gideon.jpg)During that time we're offering Nix Tix *Return to Ravnica* Block booster draft queues that feature the normal prize structures. This means that so long as you have the booster packs, you can draft and earn prizes without needing any event tickets!


So [go download the wide beta client](/en/articles/archive/2011-10-17) (if you haven't already) and give it a try! We need to hear your feedback, and the two best ways to do it are either by using the [feedback form](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1028055/magic-online-wide-beta-feedback-form) which goes directly to those in charge of **Magic** Online, or posting in [the forums](http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/view/75846/135046/magic_online_general). If you want you can email me and I'll relay the feedback to the **Magic** Online team.
