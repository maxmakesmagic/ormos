Alchemy Rebalancing for August 11, 2022

On Thursday, August 11, the next game update brings several adjustments to cards in Alchemy and Historic, as well as changes to rebalance support for *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* Draft.


Constructed Changes
===================


**Cabaretti Revels**  

Costs RRG (from 1RG)


![Cabaretti Revels](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_81958_Printed_CabarettiRevels.png)


Decks were too easily able to splash Cabaretti Revels, strengthening decks that were already powerful. We are adjusting the mana cost to increase the color requirements to cast Cabaretti Revels to make it more difficult to splash and increase its deck-building requirement.


**Racketeer Boss**  

Cards now lose ability once cast


![Racketeer Boss](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_81962_Printed_RacketeerBoss.png)


Like the combo with Grinning Ignus, Racketeer Boss was still enabling combo decks using Acererak the Archlich and Ominous Traveler. We are removing the ability to repeatedly generate treasure to close out the combos while keeping its strength and functionality in fair decks.


Draft Changes
=============


We are aiming to make underperforming strategies and archetypes stronger in *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* Draft. Most of the changes aim to make blocking and other defensive strategies stronger. We are increasing the toughness of five blue creatures, allowing Young Red Dragon to block, and changing a few other cards like Manticore, Circle of the Land Druid and Eyes of the Beholder to make it easier to defend against aggressive decks. 


We are also reducing the efficiency of Steadfast Unicorn, Blessed Hippogriff, and Guildsworn Prowlers. These were some of the strongest commons in Draft that made blocking too difficult. It was too easy to use Steadfast Unicorn's ability and Blessed Hippogriff's adventure while casting other spells in the same turn. Reducing Guildsworn Prowler's power will shift it from a strong attacker to a defensive and synergistic card.


We're also making additional adjustments to ensure blue is a more viable draft color choice. Charmed Sleep was poorly positioned against this format's sacrifice and blink effects, so we redesigned You Come to a River to give the color a more consistent removal spell. This redesign and the defensive buffs to blue creatures should make the color stronger overall, with additional indirect help coming from buffs to Dragon deck archetypes.


**Dragonborn Looter**  

Costs U (from 1U)
