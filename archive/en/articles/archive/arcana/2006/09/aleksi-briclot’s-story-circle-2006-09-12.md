Ever since [you voted](/en/node/642121) for Aleksi Briclot’s [Story Circle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Story+Circle) sketch in Selecting *Tenth Edition*, he’s been madly crafting new art for this powerful defensive enchantment. He was generous enough to share with us several work-in-progress stages of his piece, from his first sketches to **today’s premiere** of the final *Tenth Edition* art! Aleksi even provides some comments on each stage of the art. Check it out.

 Stage 1: “It was the first doodle, just trying to find an interesting composition focused on a circle.”

 Stage 2: “Complete change, I wasn’t happy with the first try. Just focusing on the body gesture.”

 Stage 3: “Adding the magic effect circle.”

 Stage 4: “More details and more magic effects, adding some other circles.”

 Stage 5: “Managing colors, the most important part of the card. This was the sketch I sent for the deathmatch, for the **Magic** site.”

 Stage 6: “Then I read in the thread dedicated to the contest that the card must be white. I tried to keep my first feeling; I needed darker areas to keep the different colors well separated, so I tried to avoid flashy and too-vivid effects, but also to make the magic effects pop out.”

You’ll see [Story Circle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Story+Circle) in its final form when *Tenth Edition* releases, Summer 2007.
