The ninth and final round of Day One here at Grand Prix Prague featured quite a few familiar faces battling it out in bubble matches. With a 6-2 record these players all entered the last round with their tournament lives at stake. What decks did they battle with? How did they do? We took a look at a few of the tables struggling to continue their tournament life on Sunday.


### Patrick Dickmann (Splinter Twin) vs. Petr Semrad (Affinity)



![Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ancient%20Grudge&options=)

Recent Grand Prix winner Patrick Dickmann, with his beloved [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) deck had surprisingly already picked up two losses in the tournament. The old faithful however delivered swiftly to a 2-0 victory against his Czech opponent. Dickmann summed up Affinity as one of his best matchups, but admitted to being a bit lucky after staring down a lethal 6/6 [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) only to dig with [Izzet Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm), finding an [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge).


  

### Robert Jurkovic (Affinity) vs. Pavlos Fafalios (Merfolk)




![Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Master%20of%20Etherium&options=)

Slovak Robert Jurkovic found himself of the fortunate end of a very good matchup in the last round. Probably smiling inside when it turned out his opponent was on Merfolks he had no problems picking up a 2-0 win. Not even a mulligan to 4 in the second game could stop him, as he came back with [Whipflare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipflare) getting rid of his opponent's board of three merfolks and following it up with [Steel Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer) and [Master of Etherium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium).


  

### Frederico Bastos (Scapeshift) vs. Matthias Langner (Tron)




![Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Karn%20Liberated&options=)

Grand Prix grinder Frederico Bastos had his back against the wall with his [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) deck in the last round. Things looked good when he took the second game of the match with [Sowing Salt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sowing+Salt), a strong card against his Urzatron opponent. The third game however had nothing but salt in the wounds as he ended up staring down into the eyes of both [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) and [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) for a 1-2 loss.


  

### Max Sjöblom (Melira Pod) vs. Sylvain Martins (Blue/White/Red)




![Baneslayer Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Baneslayer%20Angel&options=)

Finnish Sjöblom, who made top 8 in the very first Modern Pro Tour in 2011, and recently won a qualifier for the next one in Valencia was hoping to get a weekend of practice and hopefully a few Pro Points with him on his way to Spain. His French opponent however wanted something else and took down the match 2-1, sealing the deal in the final game with Stoney [Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silence), shutting down any [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) attempts by Sjöblom, and eventually winning in the air with Vendillion Clique and [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel).


  

### Tomas Holzinger (Kiki-Jiki Pod) vs. Mateusz Myslicki (Affinity)




![Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Birthing%20Pod&options=)

Austrian youngster Tomas Holzinger might have been playing a [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) deck, but it was [Izzet Staticaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Staticaster) that was the MVP in his last round 2-0 defeat of an unsuspecting Polish Affinity player. Not even [Etched Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) could win the race, and Holzinger makes day here at Grand Prix Prague.
