It is time to look at the tokens that come in *Avacyn Restored* booster packs. In fact, since we're pretty far into the preview schedule, we can show some of the cards that *make* these tokens.

This is the alternate-art foil prerelease version of Moonsilver Spear. You can get one just for playing in an [*Avacyn Restored* Prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-facts)! The Angel tokens are also created by Entreat the Angels, as seen in Tuesday's [Serious Fun](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/191), where Adam Styborski used it to good effect in a couple of fun decks.

Commander's Authority isn't the only card that creates 1/1 white Human tokens, but it's the only one that's been previewed. It makes a [great wallpaper](/en/node/644001).

Clearly, not all cards in *Avacyn Restored* have been previewed. For example, there are both 1/1 white Spirit tokens *and* blue Spirit tokens. But where do they come from? Nobody knows! Spooky, right?

Demonic Rising was previewed this week in Gavin Verhey's new column [ReConstructed](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/191), where he takes deck submissions from the audience and helps people make their decks the best they can be.

Just because Avacyn is back to lead an army of angels doesn't mean all the zombies are gone quite yet. This 2/2 black Zombie token is bound to be lurching around somewhere. But there are humans, too! Specifically, 1/1 red Humans.

Okay, technically an emblem isn't a token. Too bad! Tamiyo, the Moon Sage was previewed in last week's [Top Decks](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/td/190) by Mike Flores.
