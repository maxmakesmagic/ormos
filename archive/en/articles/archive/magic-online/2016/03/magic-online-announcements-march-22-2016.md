**Build Notes**


**General**


* Duel Scene | Players should no longer experience lag when tapping cards.
* Cardset | The mana abilities of [Commander's Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commander%27s+Sphere) and [Command Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Command+Tower) once again work as expected.
* Cardset | [Myr Superion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Superion) can again no longer be cast with mana from noncreature sources.
* Cardset | [Lightning Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm)’s activated ability once again works as expected.
* Duel Scene | Creatures tapped to help cast a spell with convoke no longer retain a green highlight after the spell is cast.
* Cardset | [Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest) now works as expected. Notably, it will no longer exile itself if it enters the battlefield without being cast, nor will it exile a double-faced *Magic Origins* creature/planeswalker attempting to return to the battlefield as a planeswalker.
* Duel Scene | Activated abilities that require players to discard cards at random, such as those found on [Ogre Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Shaman) and [Barbarian Bully](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Bully), now actually require players to discard cards at random.
* Cardset | The targeting comments on [Rolling Thunder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Thunder) and [Electrolyze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze) are now more clear.
* Cardset | [Patrician’s Scorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patrician%E2%80%99s+Scorn) can once again be cast for its alternative cost.
* Cardset | Players can once again use exiled split cards with [Jester’s Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jester%E2%80%99s+Scepter) to counter an opponent’s split card.
* Cardset | [Gaze of the Gorgon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon) now properly destroys creatures again.
* Cardset | Players whose opening hand contains [Gemstone Caverns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Caverns) and who are not playing first can once again choose to have [Gemstone Caverns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Caverns) start the game on the battlefield with a luck counter.
* Cardset | [Mizzix of the Izmagnus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzix+of+the+Izmagnus) no longer causes spells with a variable in their mana cost to sometimes cost an incorrect amount of mana.
* Cardset | Players must once again pay the proper amount of mana to activate the abilities of [Candelabra of Tawnos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Candelabra+of+Tawnos) and [Magus of the Candelabra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Candelabra).
* Cardset | [Elemental Resonance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elemental+Resonance) now allows players to properly choose a color of mana for each hybrid symbol in the enchanted creature's cost.
* Cardset | [Balduvian Fallen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balduvian+Fallen)’s triggered ability now correctly increases its power when its controller pays its cumulative upkeep cost with either black or red mana.
* Cardset | Spells cast for a bestow cost are no longer incorrectly affected by spells or abilities that reduce the cost of creature spells.
* Cardset | When paying a cost that involves the snow mana symbol, mana from snow permanents is no longer removed from the player's mana pool without being applied to pay the cost.
* Cardset | Players who control [Wort, the Raidmother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wort%2C+the+Raidmother) and cast [Burn at the Stake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burn+at+the+Stake) or [Firecat Blitz](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firecat+Blitz) may no longer pay the spell's conspire cost without tapping creatures.
* Duel Scene | Several bugs not listed elsewhere that caused crashes have been resolved, including a bug involving a player conceding while another player is making a mulligan decision.
