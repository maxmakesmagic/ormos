Day 2 Coverage



385 of the original 1,246 players managed to earn the requisite record of 6-3 or better yesterday and qualified for the second day of Grand Prix Warsaw. Now they'd fight through another six rounds of Standard on their way to the Top 8, and at the end of the day on of them would hoist the trophy and claim the title.


As for decks: Going into the day, there was a lot of energy and then some. But some spicy brews also made it to the top, like the Sultai Reanimator played by Romania's World *Magic* Cup team captain Valentin Roman, who went 11-0-1 across Friday's Trial and Saturday's rounds with it. Or Hannes Kerem's Green-Blue Pummeler earning a 9-0 record of Day 1, putting Kerem into a great spot to make what would be the third GP Top 8 of his career. Green-White Cat Aggro's Adorned Pouncer, pumped, punched its way to a lot of victories too.


Stay tuned for news and updates straight from the battlefield; watch live as the Standard format evolves; stand by for decklists and for the epic conclusion of Grand Prix Warsaw 2017!

 




Day 1 Coverage



Amidst celebrations of Polish Independence Day, 1,246 Standard players gathered in Warsaw this Saturday to seek relics and to take hostages, to shock and to abrade, to harness lightning or to strike with it, to wind some constrictors and to worship The Scarab God. After nine rounds, four of them still sported an unblemished record of 9-0. Temur Energy players Pol Pizarro and Samuel Vuillot, champion of GP Utrecht earlier this year, Hannes Kerem, who already had two GP Top 8s on his record and was playing Green-Blue Electrostatic Pummeler, and Russia's Alexander Privalov piloting Mardu Vehicles.


The pros, fresh back from the previous week's Pro Tour *Ixalan* in Albuquerque, mostly stuck with the established decks. Of the thirteen Gold and Platinum players, a full nine chose to run some Temur-based energy strategy, most with little to no black, some with quite a bit. We still got to see a number of new developments in the feature match area however. Apart from the aforementioned Pummeler deck, Green-White Aggro popped up again and again, one Sultai Reanimator earned a 11-0-1 record between Friday's Trial and Saturday's main-event rounds, and White-Black Tokens actually delivered a proper combo kill, drawing an unlimited number of cards with Ruthless Knave before ending the game with Marionette Master!


Tune back in tomorrow for more Standard news and Standard action, for decklists and expert commentary, for the homestretch and the epic conclusion of Grand Prix Warsaw 2017!
