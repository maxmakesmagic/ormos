Today's Must
============


1. [The Blue Kid on the Block](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-blue-kid-on-the-block/) | ChannelFireball | Neal Oliver

The Eldrazi, not content with taking over Modern (and maybe even Legacy!) have turned their eyes to Standard. This time Neal Oliver is showing off his Bluedrazi deck, which he used to make the Top 16 of a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier last weekend. You can read all about it in the article or, for bonus content, check out [the podcast on which Neal talks about the deck](https://alliedstrategiespodcast.wordpress.com/2016/02/19/episode-37-mono-u-eldrazi/).


Apparently the deck is the flavor of the day, as there are two other takes on Blue Eldrazi decks in Standard just today. Conley Woods's [Dimirdrazi deck that he discusses today on TCGPlayer](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13133&writer=Conley+Woods&articledate=2-23-2016) is buttressed by a mono-blue list similar to Oliver's by Mike Sigrist (Warning: Subscription required) on [StarCityGames.com Premium today](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32445_The-Eldrazi-Blues.html). (Note, I try to avoid subscription links, but since it's all wrapped up in the same discussion, I'll make an exception this time. But [*next* time, Gadget, next time...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_2_cJxYYhM)er, I mean. Yeah.)


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [MTG Lore: To Kill A Titan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDu03VX55z8) | Seibenlore

Tomorrow is another *Magic* Story article, but today you have Seibenlore to tide you over. Here, he walks through how the Gatewatch took down Kozilek and Ulamog—and through all of the drama, through all of the story points, through the entire climax, he never drops his announcer voice.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDu03VX55z8>


1. [Episode 407—Character Creation (MTG RPG)](http://themanapool.com/podcast/episode-407/) | The Mana Pool

Well, one day after I touted The Mana Pool as being fun, they go and do something—well, really fun. In this case, the dorks are mashing up *Magic* with Role Playing Games and fooling around with, well, a *Magic* RPG. They also talk about some *Magic* news—it is a podcast clocking in at just shy of two hours—but the fun part is definitely the RPG talk.


1. [Pauper Stravaganza on PureMTGO](http://puremtgo.com/)

Do you like Pauper? If not, skip this section. But if you do like Pauper, today is a good day for content! PureMTGO is becoming *the* Pauper site, and there are three articles posted within the last 24 hours from three different writers. Check it:


* [Writer Adept: Standard Pauper Double League Finals, Phase Two](http://puremtgo.com/articles/writer-adept-standard-pauper-double-league-finals-phase-two) by Gwyned (not his or her real name, I presume)
* [The Common Corner: An Introduction to the Tiers of Pauper](http://puremtgo.com/articles/common-corner-introduction-tiers-pauper) by Christopher Oliver (probably the author's real name!)
* [Izzet Time to Delve into Blue-Red Fiend?](http://puremtgo.com/articles/izzet-time-delve-ur-fiend) by Anthony Davis ("Anthony"? Hmm, seems suspect.)

And, in case that isn't enough, Pauper fiend Alex Ullman has an [article on Gathering Magic today](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/alexullman-022316-the-new-pauper-tron/) as well.


1. [*Eternal Masters* / The Reserved List](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/11201) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

Everyone's really excited about [*Eternal Masters*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-eternal-masters-2016-02-15), but most of the talk so far has been about implications for Legacy. The fact of the matter is, *Eternal Masters* is made to goose a number of formats that rely on older cards—Cube and Commander among them. Here, The Command Zone crew talks about what this reprint set will mean for Commander. They also sing, so there's that too.


1. [Magic Gatherings #33: Remembering Kamigawa](http://geeklyinc.com/magic-gatherings-33-remembering-kamigawa/) | Geekly Inc. | Harry Huberty

I missed this a few days ago, but I thought it was cool enough to bubble up once I discovered it (and by discovered I mean it was Tweeted at me). [Modern Flashback drafts](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/year-of-modern-flashbacks-2015-12-14) are going on right now on *Magic Online*, and we're smack in the middle of *Champions of Kamigawa* drafting, with Draft queues switching over to *Champions-Champions*-*Betrayers* tomorrow. This block is actually a blast to draft, and I'm not just saying that because I went 8-1 in matches the other day.


Oh, right, this article. Here, Harry revisits and remembers *Champions of Kamigawa* thoroughly, and, as you can tell from the article, with quite a bit of love.


What People Are Talking About

Huh, that's weird. Didn't we just announce a set called the [*Conspiracy: The Reign of Brago*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-conspiracy-2)? (\*Checks work I've been doing for months\*) Yup. Yes we did. We might have to do something about that. I've gotta make some calls...

There has been exactly one emergency banning in the history of *Magic*, but that hasn't stopped people from calling for another one concerning the Eldrazi in Modern, especially after the results of the latest [StarCityGames.com Modern Open](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/200216_louisville.html) seemed to confirm the Eldrazi's dominance of the format.


But, as Aaron Forsythe confirmed on Twitter yesterday, there will be no emergency ban. In fact, Forsythe [lamented the fact that there had ever been an emergency ban](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron/status/701896312606760961), and said that [the line that ban set, turn-one kills, was not one that had been crossed](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron/status/701893348177506304). That line was [Memory Jar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Jar), which was emergency banned at the height of Combo Winter when things were already bad and people were dying on the first turn.


And, as expected, players on both sides of the discussion—[pro emergency ban](https://twitter.com/misterorange/status/701893751946485764) and [con](https://twitter.com/thepchapin/status/701922420534317056)—[chimed in](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/473a5r/aaron_forsythe_on_twitter_the_eldrazi_have_left/). The discussion has been lively, but there will be no changes to the Banned and Restricted list until the normal announcement.


When is the normal announcement, you ask? Our schedule for some time has been to announce any B&R updates the Monday after the Prerelease, in this case April 4. We will be sticking to that schedule for the time being, so look for any updates (and no, I don't know if or what those might be) on April 4.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Vintage Super League regular season finale](http://www.twitch.tv/magic): 6 p.m. PST

Vintage Super League is a *Magic* streaming league pitting some of the best Vintage players in the world against one another, with each week showing every player playing once. It's the best way to watch Vintage played at a high level on a regular basis.


And tonight it gets exciting.


Ten players enter, and one gets cut from the league! Sure, the Vintage Super League will also determine which four players make the playoffs, but I'm more interested in the brutal race for not last. Whoever finishes last in the league gets dropped from it for the next season, lost to the annals of history, forever forgotten, their name erased from all Vintage text books in schools the world over.


Where does everyone stand? Well, six of the ten players have three wins or fewer, with Steve Menendian currently taking up the rear at 2-6.


Check out the full standings on the [Vintage Super League website](http://vintagesuperleague.com/), or tune in tonight at 6 p.m. PST on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Grixis MOCS Control](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-mocs-2016-02-22-0)

If you follow both [Evan Erwin](https://twitter.com/misterorange) and me on Twitter (so, like, two of you), you might have caught us drooling over this list below. I'm a huge fan of [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) and [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet), and this deck manages to play both of them. In a way, this deck is similar to the Dark Jeskai decks that have been in the format for a while, but it eschews white altogether. In return, the deck gets some more counterspells and swaps out [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom) for targeted removal.


The result? OnlineMagics took the list all the way to third place in the [Standard *Magic Online* Championship Series tournament](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-mocs-2016-02-22-0) the other day.


I would also recommend checking out the deck that won, by Quikidk: a Jeskai Dragons list that finally combines [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider), [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai), and [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent).


(And if you pay close attention to the Top 8 of that tournament, you'll also notice that *Magic* Daily Update favorite-named player JohnnyHotSauce makes another appearance.)
