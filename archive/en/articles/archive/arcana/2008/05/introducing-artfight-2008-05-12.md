M**agic** is a game of battle: battles between planeswalkers, battles between fierce creatures, battles of wits. Now, the battle rages on in a new way: art against art!

[![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1588_jaceartfight.jpg)](http://apps.facebook.com/artfight)We're pleased to announce the launch of ArtFight, a Facebook application that lets you settle the age-old questions: Which art is cooler, [Reya Dawnbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reya+Dawnbringer) or [Lavaborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaborn+Muse)? [Benalish Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Knight) or [Counsel of the Soratami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counsel+of+the+Soratami)?

ArtFight lets you pick between two random pieces of **Magic** art, choosing which one you think is cooler. Then, periodically, you'll get a bonus round where you'll be asked "Which of these two images has been rated higher by others?" The better you do, the more you'll score. You can compare your scores with your friends' in overall XP, longest streak of right answers to bonus questions, and average streak of right answers to bonus questions.

If you're already on Facebook, [login to the application](http://apps.facebook.com/artfight) and get fighting! Not on Facebook? Click [here](http://www.facebook.com/index.php) to get started.

UPDATE: ArtFight is experiencing some post-launch jitters. If you have any trouble with it, check back later in the day.
