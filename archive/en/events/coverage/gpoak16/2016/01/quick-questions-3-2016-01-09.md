### What’s the Most Important Sideboard Card this Weekend?

**Ari Lax – “**[Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), although it can be a maindeck card too. People forget how good that card is because it’s been around forever. But it is better than it’s ever been. All the best things are spells!”


When asked about what card feels the best to take with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), Lax answered, “Duress.”

**Brian Kibler – “**Planeswalker cards in general, really. [Ob Nixilis Reignited](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ob+Nixilis+Reignited), Kiora Master of the Depths—those guys. Because decks are all good at exchanging resources and have good removal. It’s important to have efficient, reusable threats that don’t die to most of that stuff. That’s why Ob Nixilis has been good recently.”

**(HoF) Patrick Chapin** – “That’s tricky to answer, because I’d be OK with people *not* playing [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths) in their sideboards, because they have them all in their maindeck.”

**(24) Craig Wescoe – “**It’s either [Hallowed Moonlight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Moonlight) or [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance) for me. [Hallowed Moonlight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Moonlight) is how you beat the Rally decks. You can bring them in against other decks too, but its mainly there for Rally. And it does well. And [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance) is what I need for Abzan. I expected there to be a lot of Abzan here this week.”

**Matt Sperling – “**You know, you can’t quite maindeck [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). But it takes [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) out of ramp, it takes [Secure the Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secure+the+Wastes) and [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) from Esper Tokens, and it takes [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors) too. It just get’s everything.”

**(9) Alex Hayne –** “Disdainful Stroke. It just works. It’s good against Ramp, Jeskai, Mardu, and Esper. And because of the dual lands, basically any deck gets to play it. People have off-color duals and fetches already.”
