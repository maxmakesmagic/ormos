Michael Jacob vs. Steven Collett
--------------------------------


Michael Jacob and Steven Collett both qualified for Nationals at [Regionals in Michigan](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2007-regionals-2007-06-12-4). Now they've put away their Standard decks and are playing each other in Limited at 5-0.


### Game 1


Game 1 got off to a fast start as each player suspended a card on turn one. [Ivory Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Giant) for MJ, and [Mindstab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindstab) for Steve. MJ followed up with [Augur of Skulls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Skulls), and Steven played a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), revealing them both to be playing white-black. Steve didn't have a turn-two play, but did have [Smallpox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox) on turn three for MJ's [Augur of Skulls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Skulls). This seemed to put MJ in a bad spot as he had no pressure, and the [Mindstab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindstab) was about to wipe out his hand. He discarded two lands and a [Lucent Liminid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lucent+Liminid), showing that he'd drawn at least seven lands so far this game.

Steve just kept coming out with hits in the form of [Thunder Totem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunder+Totem), [Brain Gorgers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Gorgers) and [Putrid Cyclops](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Cyclops), who killed himself. He also played a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) in addition to the one he discarded to [Smallpox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox), showing himself to be a solid three colours. MJ decided to race the [Brain Gorgers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Gorgers) with [Ivory Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Giant), which left the life totals at 9 for Steve, and 7 for MJ after his seventh turn. MJ had [Ichor Slick](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichor+Slick) for the [Brain Gorgers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Gorgers) in attempt to stem the bleeding. This left him without good blocks for the Gorgon, but fortunately Steve neglected to attack, just playing [Knight of Sursi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Sursi) with a plan to win in the air.


MJ played a [Blightspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightspeaker) on his turn, which could be trouble if he had some [Aven Riftwatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher)s to search out. An end-of-turn [Stonecloaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonecloaker) and the [Knight of Sursi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Sursi) put MJ on two-and in what looked like a great deal of trouble. He responded to his second Suspended [Ivory Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Giant) coming into play by activating [Blightspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightspeaker) and finding exactly the [Aven Riftwatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher) he needed to survive.


[Quagnoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quagnoth) showed up for Steve, but it looked like the game had already moved to the air, and a big ground guy wasn't going to be very relevant. Steve just attacked with [Knight of Sursi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Sursi) on his turn since the [Aven Riftwatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher) had put MJ up to four. He followed up with the [Gorgon Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorgon+Recluse) that the [Stonecloaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonecloaker) returned, and passed the turn. MJ had his second [Ichor Slick](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichor+Slick) to remove the [Stonecloaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonecloaker), which let the [Aven Riftwatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher) and [Blightspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightspeaker) put Steve away in a game that looked pretty ugly for MJ at a couple of points.


Jacob 1, Collett 0


### Game 2


Steve started off the second game with a pair of mulligans, and commented on his disdain for feature matches. Steve had [Mindstab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindstab) on turn one again, with a turn-three [Thunder Totem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunder+Totem) to follow it up, while MJ didn't do anything for the first three turns. Steve didn't have a second white mana to activate the Totem, so he just passed turn four. MJ had a lowly [Sinew Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinew+Sliver) for his fourth turn.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/usnat07/fm6_jacob.jpg)*Jacob's fortunes turned late in Game 1.*
Steve's [Mindstab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindstab) went off on turn five, to which MJ discarded two extra lands and an [Aven Riftwatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher). MJ attacked into the brains on turn five, and then played [Spitting Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Sliver), showing that he was willing to "trade" for the [Brain Gorgers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Gorgers) in combat when he could use a trick, but didn't want to make the "trade" because he didn't simply sacrifice the Sliver to the [Brain Gorgers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Gorgers)' come-into-play trigger. Steve drew a land, which let him play [Magus of the Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Coffers). He double-blocked the [Sinew Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinew+Sliver) with [Brain Gorgers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Gorgers) and Magus, and MJ had [Stonecloaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonecloaker) to make combat pretty ugly for Steve.


Steve was able to halt MJ's attacks next turn by playing [Griffin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide) on [Magus of the Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Coffers). All MJ could do was pass the turn and wait for a better opportunity to attack. [Stronghold Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stronghold+Rats) showed up for Steve, and he passed the turn hoping nothing bad would happen to the Magus.


Unfortunately, something bad did happen. MJ had [Death Rattle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Rattle), which allowed him to get in for six with the two slivers which put Steve to 8. Steve got back with the Rats, and discarded his useless [Mana Tithe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Tithe) while MJ discarded a land. MJ attacked with all his guys on his next turn, and regenerated his [Stonecloaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonecloaker) with [Dawn Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Charm) after Steve blocked it with his Griffin token.


Steve didn't have a play on his next turn, and died to MJ's creatures. His two mulligans were almost certainly the deciding factor in this game.


Michael Jacob defeats Steve Collett 2-0.
