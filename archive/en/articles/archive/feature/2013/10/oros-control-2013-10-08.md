Oros Control
============

Luis Scott-Vargas plays, writes, and makes videos about Magic. He has played on the Pro Tour for almost a decade, and between that and producing content for ChannelFireball, often has his hands full (of cards). 







Oros Control (named after none other than [Oros, the Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oros%2C+the+Avenger), at least until the wedge version of *Shards of Alara* comes out) is a deck that's been floating around Standard and Block for a while now. I even talked about it in [my second article for this very column](/en/articles/archive/ghost-baron-2013-07-10) and am revisiting it now that *Theros* is out. 

![Obzedat, Ghost Council](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Obzedat%2C+Ghost+Council) The list I'll be looking at today is what Sam Pardee used to play against Josh Utter-Leyton in some [testing videos they recorded](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/standard-testing-sam-pardee-bwr-vs-wrapter-uw/), and it's got no shortage of *Theros* cards. As before, the driving force behind this deck is attrition, as it's got a ton of removal, a couple solid card-advantage mechanisms, and some hard-to-kill threats that often trade for multiple cards. 

 The removal is the strongest reason to be in these three colors, especially since they aren't "traditional" control colors (i.e., they have no blue). [Anger of the Gods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods) is the best sweeper in Standard, and its only drawback is that it's hard to construct a red-based control deck. [Chained to the Rocks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) is the most efficient removal spell in Standard, given you meet the condition of having a Mountain, and old favorites [Dreadbore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreadbore) and [Warleader's Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warleader%27s+Helix) are both great at killing a wide range of targets. 

 Card advantage is something this deck was lacking before, and [Read the Bones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones) helps immensely in that regard. It ensures you will hit your land drops, filters you through whichever type of card is dead at the moment, and overall combines very well with what the deck is trying to do. [Rakdos's Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return) remains the anti-control finisher of choice, and for good reason. A resolved Return is one of the best things you can do against other control decks, especially if they have a Planeswalker in play. 

 The threats have also been updated, as Obzedat and [Boros Reckoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner) are joined by [Desecration Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon), Elspeth, and [Whip of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos). I like Whip, and particularly the interaction with Ghost Council (it survives by exiling itself), and might look to fit a second in the deck. 

 This deck gained a lot from *Theros*, and especially now that it has [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) in the board, has a much better shot at competing against the [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) decks that were its bane before.
