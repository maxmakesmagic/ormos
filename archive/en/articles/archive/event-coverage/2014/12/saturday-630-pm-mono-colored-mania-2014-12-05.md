It has been quite some time any format has seen that much "mono-coloration". It seems that while two-color decks remain popular, some players have decided that they never want to be color-screwed for the entirety of this tournament. Let us take a look at all the single colored decks which I have witnessed today. Ironically, it seems to be a colorful world out there!

The little red men are back! Alike the highly fanatical [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), its fellow buddies like [Goblin Chieftain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chieftain), [Ember Hauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Hauler) and [Goblin Wardriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Wardriver) also have equally strong desires to crash into the red zone. Teaming up Haste and [Battle Cry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Cry) can literally make opponents cry. Players who prefer not lose to a well-timed [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) or [Slagstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagstorm) can opt to toast their opponents to a crisp with multiple burn spells which fuel [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) and then finish them off with [Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer).

Mono black control decks with a minor infect theme has also proven to be popular. Harnessing the power of [Lashwrithe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashwrithe) in combination with Phyrexian [Crusade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusade)r and Skithiryx, the [Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blight) Dragon, it has been able to kill at alarming speeds. Efficient removal like [Gatekeeper of Malakir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir), [Go for the Throat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) and [Black Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) is also generally quite good against the field. Since the days of [Cabal Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Coffers) (which is close to an alarming 10 years ago), we have seldom seen any decks running more than 20 Swamps.

Players who swear by white mana have the option of overwhelming their opponents with weenies and equipment. More than one player was seen trying to complete [Quest for the Holy Relic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quest+for+the+Holy+Relic) in an attempt to demolish the opposing board with [Argentum Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argentum+Armor). Another approach is to use [Puresteel Paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin) to draw multiple cards with [Flayer Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk)s and an assortment of Swords of different shapes and sizes before equipping them for free. Oh wait, there are some [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) decks running around too although, to be fair, it contains more artifacts than actual white cards!

The little green men are back as well! Not having to face the previously easily tutorable Sword of Feast and [Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Famine), [Vengevine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine)s dumped into the graveyard via [Fauna Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman) can finally attack at ease again. Usual suspects like [Ezuri, Renegade Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%2C+Renegade+Leader) and [Elvish Archdruid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid) team up with [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) and [Eldrazi Monument](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Monument) for lethal amounts of damage. [Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast) Within remains an important spell to remove opposing Planeswalkers and Titans in a pinch.

And as always, blue players are enjoying punching up their opponents with a myriad of efficient Merfolk spearheaded by [Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis). The ability to create a [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) while protecting their best threats with [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) remains a potent and powerful strategy. (WHAT? Wrong format! Oops!)


Now the question is... Where is the mono blue deck in Standard?
