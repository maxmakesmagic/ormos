### Comments:


Watermarks are gone. The card concepts should be sufficient to indicate faction.


The pack shows the mechanical core for each faction.


Natives now have all the sacrifice effects and death triggers. I also brought back persist, as it plays well with their flavor, their style of grinding advantage, and both sacrifice effects and death triggers. Despite their complexity, the fungus tokens are important so players can assemble a critical mass of sacrifice effects that they can use without feeling bad. I show a goblin token also to indicate that the natives are small but overwhelming in numbers.


Prisoners have the primary -1/-1 counter interactions, entering the battlefield with them and removing them with triggers or for effects. Countercast (now Discharge) is now a cost reduction mechanic to create shields down moments, get rid of the colored permanent requirement, and because being free really restricted what effects I could use.


Sentinels (formerly Watchers) are perpetually outnumbered, reflected in their Stalwart ability. Additionally, I'm pushing the Sentinels towards playing more non-creature spells to create a pull towards building different decks (particularly in limited). The reward for having few (but not no) creatures is one mechanism. Conduit of Power is another.


Many people questioned why the Natives were important. Mylormyx is the answer to that. He is a native who achieved his planeswalker spark, and then is leading his people in revolt. He is the destabilizing force that sets the events of the block in motion.
