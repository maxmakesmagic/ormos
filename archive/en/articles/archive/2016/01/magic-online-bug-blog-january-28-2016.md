Known Issues List Updates
=========================


**UPDATE:** The *Magic Online* team deployed an emergency update to fix several recent issues on January 28. Full details can be found below.


To support the *Oath of the Gatewatch* release, *Magic Online* had to make some changes to the entire system that governs paying mana costs. Please read Alli Medwin’s [R&D feature](:%20http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/costs-costs-2016-01-27) for more information.


Due to these changes, adding mana to the mana pool prior to selecting a spell to cast or activating an ability will require players to manually select the mana in the mana pool to fulfill generic mana requirements, as this mana will no longer be auto-consumed as players might be used to. While we hope to improve this process with a future update, players can avoid the extra clicks this change causes by selecting the spell or ability first and then tapping their lands to pay the mana cost.


On the upside, this same mana refactor update has also fixed several existing issues around mana consumption interactions with cards such as [Mishra's Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) and [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls). This build has also fixed several longstanding issues for customers, including an issue with [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) incorrectly exciling creature tokens. The full list of fixes can be found in the sections below.


Additionally, R&D member Robert Schuster went over some changes to [paying life for spells requiring Phyrexian mana](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/138184621244/phyrexian-mana-and-clicking-you) and [casting 0-mana spells](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/138196126704/free-spells-one-click) over on the [*Magic Online* Tumblr](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/).


The Known Issues List below has been updated, so refer to that for the most up-to-date statuses on *Magic Online* known issues. If you want to see the history of fixed known issues, refer to the [archive](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-fixed-known-issues-archive).




Oath of the Gatewatch Known Issues
----------------------------------





**Gameplay**


* Cardset | [Stone Haven Outfitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Haven+Outfitter)’s triggered ability incorrectly triggers when a creature is destroyed if an Equipment had previously been destroyed while equipping that creature.
* Cardset | Players are incorrectly unable to undo [Kozilek’s Translator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%E2%80%99s+Translator)‘s activated ability.
* Cardset | When a player casts [Kozilek, the Great Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+the+Great+Distortion), its triggered ability incorrectly triggers if the casting player has seven or more cards in hand. Upon resolution, the player will not draw cards if he or she already has seven or more cards in hand.
* Cardset | If a player controls multiple [Endbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endbringer)s, only one will untap during other players’ untap steps as intended.
* Cardset | In certain circumstances, [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) incorrectly exiles creature tokens created by [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet).
* Cardset | Cards that ask players to choose a basic land type incorrectly include the option to choose Wastes. If a player attempts to choose Wastes, he or she will be asked to choose a basic land type again. Wastes are basic lands, but are not a basic land type.
* Cardset | [Crumble to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumble+to+Dust) incorrectly causes the player to search the library of the land’s controller, not owner.
* Cardset | Several prompt boxes are incorrect or uninformative. Affected cards include [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet), [Harvester Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harvester+Troll), and [Devour in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Flames).

Newly Added Known Issues
------------------------





**Gameplay**


* Cardset | [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) lacks visual indicators during targeting to show whether or not it is targeting a player.
* Cardset | [Harbinger of the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbinger+of+the+Tides)’s casting options are displayed incorrectly. Players can still pay Harbinger of the Tides’s alternative casting cost by selecting the lower “Cast” option from the menu that appears when the card is clicked.
* Cardset | If a player selects a permanent to sacrifice to an Annihilator trigger, but then deselects that permanent, the player will sometimes incorrectly be required to sacrifice an additional permanent.
* Cardset | [Mass Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Polymorph) incorrectly does not count exiled creature tokens when determining how many creature cards to put onto the battlefield.
* Cardset | Some spells that return multiple permanents from different zones to players' hands (such as [Rise & Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+%2F%2F+Fall) or [Æther Tradewinds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Tradewinds)) only return one permanent. Notably, this does not affect any cards in *Battle for Zendikar* or *Oath of the Gatewatch*.
* Cardset | Spells that require a specific color of mana to be spent (such as [Drain Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life)) incorrectly allow any color of mana to be spent.
* Cardset | The additional cost ability of [Chorus of the Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chorus+of+the+Conclave) does not function.
* Cardset | Tokens created by [Forbidden Orchard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Orchard) incorrectly appear to have flying. This is a display issue only. The tokens don’t actually fly.
* Cardset | When a user destroys [Auratouched Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratouched+Mage) before its triggered ability finishes resolving, a facedown card will be added to the owner's hand.
* Duel Scene | While paying the mana cost for a card with delve, players cannot remove cards from the delve selection without canceling the casting process and starting over.
* Duel Scene | Emblems display with an extra border.
* Duel Scene | Mana abilities of permanents that do not include a tap symbol still appear to cause the permanent to tap. This is a display issue only, and is corrected when the game advances to the next step or phase.
* Duel Scene | The “No Possible Play: Yield All” function, commonly mapped to the F8 keyboard shortcut, no longer works as intended.
* Duel Scene | Players who activate [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil)’s first loyalty ability when their opponent has only one card in hand are unable to take any actions except passing priority after that ability resolves. This effect ends when the player has passed priority once.
* Duel Scene | When casting with Convoke, creatures used for the ability have a green highlight for some turns after casting the spell.

Fixes Deployed January 27

**Game Play**


* Cardset | [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) no longer incorrectly exiles token creatures.
* Duel Scene | Colorless mana is no longer autoconsumed before special mana (e.g. from [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) and [Mishra's Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop)).
* Cardset | Costs that include a snow mana symbol now work as expected.
* Cardset | [Oblivion Sower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Sower)’s triggered ability no longer incorrectly allows players to put face-down exiled land cards onto the battlefield.
* Cardset | Creatures that would die after being dealt damage by [Kumano, Master Yamabushi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%2C+Master+Yamabushi) or one of his friends from *Kamigawa* are now properly exiled instead.
* Duel Scene | Cards that tutor for multiple cards at once now properly show the tutored cards in the Revealed Zone.
* Cardset | [Caged Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caged+Sun)’s mana ability now correctly triggers when a land is tapped for an ability that produces more than one mana.
* Cardset | Casting [Ray of Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Command) without paying its mana cost, via a spell or ability such as cascade or [Mizzix's Mastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzix%27s+Mastery), now works as expected.
* Cardset | A bug that caused a crash when a player targeted a card with split second with [Spelltwine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spelltwine) has been resolved.
* Cardset | Players who use the “Attack with all creatures” function will now see their flip creatures (such as [Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant) and [Akki Lavarunner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akki+Lavarunner)) attack as expected.

**Client**


* General | Players eliminated from Premier events no longer falsely appear higher in the standings than players who are still active in the event.

**Game Play**


* [Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest) no longer exiles itself when it is put on the battlefield without being cast.
* [Converge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Converge) spells that are copied no longer incorrectly retain their converge value.

Temporary Workarounds for Known Issues
--------------------------------------





We're hard at work whittling down the Known Issues List. In the meantime, we've found temporary solutions that may help alleviate certain problems that players are experiencing. Refer to the table below to see if there is a suggested temporary workaround for an issue that you are experiencing.


**Game Play**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| Duel Scene | Cards that search for multiple cards at once don’t show the cards properly in the Revealed Cards area. | The cards are properly identified in the game log.
   |
| Duel Scene | It is visually difficult to tell which set of blockers an attacking player is ordering when ordering multiple sets of multiple blocking creatures. | You must start by ordering blockers for the left most attacking creature, then hit OK to move on to the next attacking creature to the right.
   |
| Duel Scene | Graveyard order appears incorrectly in expanded or undocked views.
   | Keeping the graveyard in small, undocked “preview” (default) window will display order correctly for cards like [Buried Alive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) and [Sphinx’s Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%E2%80%99s+Tutelage).
   |
| Duel Scene | Zooming in on a card exiled by a land with hideaway shows an additional basic Swamp. This is a visual-only bug, players cannot play the Swamp using hideaway. | Right-clicking on the exiled land will display it correctly. |

**Client**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| Collection | Dragging or adding a large number of cards to a deck or trade binder causes *Magic Online* to freeze while processing, resulting in a "Main Navigation is Not Responding" error.
   | While the client is not responsive, waiting several minutes will allow the process to complete. Using the error dialog to close the client will cancel the transaction. |
| Duel Scene | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out. | If a player suspects this is happening, logging out and back in may resolve the problem. |
| Duel Scene | Land can visually appear tapped at the start of a turn if a player turns a creature face up during their opponent's end step.
   | The issue is visual only and clicking the tapped lands will add mana to the mana pool correctly. |
| General | Under rare circumstances, the Game Details window will display buttons to replay matches instead of a round timer or standings. | As a temporary workaround, logging out and back in resolves the issue. |
| Store | Updating billing and shipping information during the checkout process can have inconsistent results.
   | Players who update from the Account Settings page should not have issues.
   |
| Trade | If a player opens a booster pack that is in their active trade binder, attempting to trade a different booster pack from the same set cancels the trade.
   | Logging out and then back in will correct this issue.

| Gameplay Known Issues |
| Cardset | Cards that require players to pay life as an alternative casting cost (such as [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will)) incorrectly require players to pay additional life when permanent effects increase the cost of spells (such as with [Sphere of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Resistance)). |
|  |
| Cardset | [Myriad Landscape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myriad+Landscape)’s activated ability incorrectly allows a player to put two basic lands that do not share a land type onto the battlefield. |
| Cardset | [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command)'s first mode doesn't appear in the Effect area after it resolves.  |

| Cardset | [Harbinger of the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbinger+of+the+Tides)’s casting options are displayed incorrectly. Players can still pay Harbinger of the Tides’s alternative casting cost by selecting the lower “Cast” option from the menu that appears when the card is clicked. |
| Cardset | [Hunting Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Wilds), when kicked, incorrectly does not untap the Forest cards put onto the battlefield during its resolution. This only affects Forest cards that enter the battlefield tapped, such as [Temple Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Garden) or [Sapseep Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapseep+Forest). |
| Cardset | If a player selects a permanent to sacrifice to an Annihilator trigger, but then deselects that permanent, the player will sometimes incorrectly be required to sacrifice an additional permanent. |
| Cardset | [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) doesn't allow the player to fail to find a card when they are not hellbent. |
| Cardset | [Lightning Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm)'s activated ability will sometimes let the wrong player change the target. To mitigate this issue, we suggest letting the [Lightning Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm) activated ability resolve before activating it another time. |
| Cardset | [Mass Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Polymorph) incorrectly does not count exiled creature tokens when determining how many creature cards to put onto the battlefield. |

| Cardset | Tokens created by [Forbidden Orchard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Orchard) incorrectly appear to have flying. This is a display issue only. The tokens don’t actually fly. |
| Cardset | [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth)'s prompt box text incorrectly suggests that the caster must cast all appropriate exiled spells. This is a display issue only. The Cancel button allows the player to continue without casting remaining spells. |
| Cardset | [Void Winnower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) incorrectly allows players to cast face-down spells. |
| Cardset | [Void Winnower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) incorrectly prohibits players from casting spells that have both an even converted mana cost and a variable in the mana cost. For example, a player whose opponent controls a [Void Winnower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) is incorrectly prohibited from casting [Rolling Thunder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Thunder) or [Nourishing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nourishing+Shoal), even if the value chosen for X would result in a spell with an odd converted mana cost. Even if a player cannot even, they should be able to odd. |
| Cardset | A [Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) copying a creature incorrectly does not display its triggered ability in blue text. |
| Cardset | Abilities that generate replacement effects preventing specific cards from being put into graveyards (such as those found on [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) or [Blightsteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus)) do not function properly while resolving [Grenzo, Dungeon Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grenzo%2C+Dungeon+Warden)'s activated ability. |
| Cardset | All legendary creature cards in all zones owned by a player who controls a [Heroes' Podium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroes%27+Podium) incorrectly receive the power/toughness bonus from its first ability. |
| Cardset | Cards cast with conspire that require a player to sacrifice a creature as an additional cost to cast, such as [Life's Legacy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life%27s+Legacy) and [Momentous Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentous+Fall), incorrectly look at the power and toughness of the last creature clicked for conspire. |
| Cardset | Cards that are exiled by [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) incorrectly show association arrows while in the Exiled Zone. |
| Cardset | Cards that ask a player to choose X targets, such as [Glimpse the Sun God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Sun+God), briefly indicate incorrectly that X is equal to zero when the last potential target is chosen before moving on to the cost payment step.  |
| Cardset | Cards that ask players to choose a basic land type incorrectly include the option to choose Wastes. If a player attempts to choose Wastes, he or she will be asked to choose a basic land type again. Wastes are basic lands, but are not a basic land type. |
| Cardset | Casting [Sylvan Primordial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordial) causes the game to be locked in a multiplayer game if there are no legal targets for one player. |
| Cardset | Conceding while looking at cards with [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) reveals cards to opponent. This applies to all actions involving scry or looking at X cards. |
| Cardset | Copying [All Suns' Dawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Suns%27+Dawn) sometimes causes a crash. |
| Cardset | If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that had a choice made as it entered (such as [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) or [Painter's Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant)), the copy correctly allows the controller to make a new choice, but the abilities of the copy that refer to that choice do not function correctly. |
| Cardset | If a player casts [Winds of Qal Sisma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winds+of+Qal+Sisma) while controlling a creature with power 4 or greater, the damage prevention effect will fail to prevent combat damage dealt to planeswalkers. |
| Cardset | If a player controls multiple [Endbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endbringer)s, only one will untap during other players’ untap steps as intended. |
| Cardset | In certain circumstances, [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) incorrectly exiles creature tokens created by [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). |
| Cardset | Players are incorrectly unable to undo [Kozilek’s Translator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%E2%80%99s+Translator)‘s activated ability. |
| Cardset | Players are unable to drag-and-drop cards to split them into piles when prompted to do so by a card like [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). Cards can no longer be dragged from one pile to another in these scenarios, but players can move cards to another pile by single-clicking on the card. |
| Cardset | Several prompt boxes are incorrect or uninformative. Affected cards include [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet), [Harvester Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harvester+Troll), and [Devour in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Flames). |
| Cardset | Some spells that return multiple permanents from different zones to players' hands (such as [Rise & Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+%2F%2F+Fall) or [Æther Tradewinds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Tradewinds)) only return one permanent. Notably, this does not affect any cards in *Battle for Zendikar* or *Oath of the Gatewatch*. |
| Cardset | Spells that require a specific color of mana to be spent (such as [Drain Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life)) incorrectly allow any color of mana to be spent. |
| Cardset | Spells that target [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) more than once incorrectly trigger [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent)'s ability twice. |
| Cardset | The additional cost ability of [Chorus of the Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chorus+of+the+Conclave) does not function. |
| Cardset | The game log does not display the third choice of a [Confluence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5BConfluence%5D&set=+%5B%22Commander%202015%22%5D). |
| Cardset | The prompt text for the second mode of [Grab the Reins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins) incorrectly omits the option to target a player. This incorrect prompt box also appears when the spell is entwined as the second targeting step. This is a text display issue only, and players that are legal targets do appear with the typical white glow indicating they can be targeted. |
| Cardset | Triggered abilities of Equipment with a trigger condition of “whenever equipped creature dies” can incorrectly trigger when a noncreature card is destroyed. This occurs when the noncreature card was a creature with that Equipment attached during the previous turn. For example, if a player uses [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker)’s first loyalty ability, then equips him with a [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp), the [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) will remain equipped for that turn. If [Sarkhan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386650) is destroyed during the following turn, [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp)’s ability will inappropriately trigger. |
| Cardset | Under rare circumstances, a player who controls two creatures that can’t attack alone (such as [Bonded Construct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Construct)) but must attack with one of them will be able to attack with only that creature rather than being required to attack with both. Under even more rare circumstances, that creature will instead turn on its controller and attack that player on the next turn. We recommend that players keep their Bonded Constructs on tight leashes. |
| Cardset | When [Entreat the Angels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) is on the stack with 0 chosen for X, the blue text that typically indicates the value of X does not appear. |
| Cardset | When a player casts [Kozilek, the Great Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+the+Great+Distortion), its triggered ability incorrectly triggers if the casting player has seven or more cards in hand. Upon resolution, the player will not draw cards if he or she already has seven or more cards in hand. |
| Cardset | When a user destroys [Auratouched Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratouched+Mage) before its triggered ability finishes resolving, a facedown card will be added to the owner's hand. |
| Duel Scene | Cards that search for multiple cards at once don’t show the cards properly in the Revealed Cards area. These cards are properly identified in the game log. |
| Duel Scene | Colorless mana autoconsumed before special mana (e.g. from [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) and [Mishra's Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop)). |
| Duel Scene | Creatures that enter the battlefield with counters based on the number of creatures in the graveyard (for example, [Undergrowth Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undergrowth+Scavenger)) do not count themselves if they are put onto the battlefield directly from the graveyard. |
| Duel Scene | Emblems display with an extra border. |
| Duel Scene | If a player’s spell or ability causes his or her own cards to be revealed, those cards are incorrectly not added to the player’s own Revealed Cards area. The player’s opponent should still see the revealed cards correctly. |
| Duel Scene | Intermittently and in certain scenarios, keyboard shortcuts (such as F2 or F6) can cause blocking assignments to be reset. This can cause players to unintentionally not block any attacking creatures. Players are encouraged to verify their blocking decisions when using these keyboard shortcuts. |
| Duel Scene | It is visually difficult to tell which set of blockers an attacking player is ordering when ordering multiple sets of multiple blocking creatures. |
| Duel Scene | Mana abilities of permanents that do not include a tap symbol still appear to cause the permanent to tap. This is a display issue only, and is corrected when the game advances to the next step or phase. |
| Duel Scene | Players who activate [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil)’s first loyalty ability when their opponent has only one card in hand are unable to take any actions except passing priority after that ability resolves. This effect ends when the player has passed priority once. |
| Duel Scene | Spells with multiple targets (such as [Silumgar's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Command), [Agony Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), etc.) sometimes lack visual indicators to show what is happening to each target.  |
| Duel Scene | The “No Possible Play: Yield All” function, commonly mapped to the F8 keyboard shortcut, no longer works as intended. |
| Duel Scene | The prompt box displays the incorrect color during the “scry-like” step in the new mulligan process. |
| Duel Scene | The prompt text where the card states "Choose up to X target... X is currently [#]." States 'zero' when the last valid target is clicked.  |
| Duel Scene | Under certain rare scenarios, attacking creatures will display on the opponent’s side of the battlefield. Resizing the *Magic Online* game window resolves this display issue. |
| Duel Scene | When a player plays a Ravnica shock land (such as [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain)) off the top of the library with [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), the new top card of the library is incorrectly revealed before the player decides whether to pay 2 life. |
| Duel Scene | When affects like [Parallax Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallax+Wave) and [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) end and creatures return to the battlefield, if one of those creatures was a [Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest) then all other creatures are Exiled.  |
| Duel Scene | When casting with Convoke, creatures used for the ability have a green highlight for some turns after casting the spell. |
| Duel Scene | When colorless mana is added to a player's mana pool as a result of a creature dying in combat (e.g. [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion), [Su-chi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Su-chi)), the user is unable to spend that mana if no stop is set. |
| Duel Scene | While paying the mana cost for a card with delve, players cannot remove cards from the delve selection without canceling the casting process and starting over. |
| Duel Scene | Zooming in on a card exiled by a land with hideaway shows an additional basic Swamp. This is a visual-only bug, players cannot play the Swamp using hideaway. Right-clicking on the exiled land will display it correctly. |
| General | When the "No Possible Play: Yield All" function is active, tapping [Mishra's Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) when it's the only land the player controls will automatically end the turn even if the mana could be spent.  |

| Client Known Issues |
| Chat | Players who drop from a League cannot send messages using a League game’s chat window.  |
| Collection | New decks with the same name as an existing deck cannot be saved. Deck names are not case-sensitive. Currently, attempting to create a deck with a name that differs only by case (e.g. “Mardu” and “mardu”) will not generate an error message. |
| Collection | While players are participating in a Constructed event or a League, cards from the decks in those events become locked and cannot be traded away. There is a red “locked card” indicator on these cards. This indicator incorrectly does not appear again after closing the client while remaining in the event. |
| Duel Scene | Challenging a player directly does not allow the player to set Wins Per Match or Match Clock options. 
  |
| Duel Scene | When face down cards are given an activated ability, the art displays incorrectly on the stack when that ability is activated.
  |
| General | If a player is running *Magic Online* on a laptop connected to a second monitor, they are unable to maximize *Magic Online* on the second monitor.
  |
| General | In certain rare circumstances, the window that displays at the end of an event does not display all prizes that the player has earned. This is a display issue only. All prizes are correctly added to players’ collections in these situations. |
| General | Under rare circumstances, the Game Details window will display buttons to replay matches instead of a round timer or standings. As a temporary workaround, logging out and back in resolves the issue. |
| General | When objects are added to a player’s collection, the window displaying these objects incorrectly defaults to sorting them alphabetically and not by type of object. This keeps booster packs earned as prizes from being immediately seen.  |
| Help Scene | The Help Scene contains several minor display errors such as blank spaces and inappropriate line breaks. |
| League | If a player has more than sixteen decks of a Constructed League’s format, a second scroll bar will incorrectly appear when entering the League and selecting a deck. |
| League | When a League transitions from Open (players can join, matches can be played) to Closed (players cannot join, matches can still be played), the message that informs players how much time remains until the League transitions to Completed (no more matches can be played) is not properly being sent. This information is still available in the League Details window, however.  |
| League | When rejoining a Constructed League, the "View Your Previous Decks" button is temporarily incorrectly inactive between opening the Entry Requirements dialog box and the next time the League Details window is opened.  |
| Limited Scene | While building a Limited deck, if a player sorts the deck under construction by converted mana cost, clicking the “Add Lands” button will return each card to the appropriate pile even if the player individually moved them to another pile. |
| Multiplayer | Dropping out of a game does not concede the game if the player is not the first one to drop out. 
  |
| Multiplayer | Multiplayer matches do not show up in a player's Game History. 
  |
| Play Lobby | Clicking the Play button in an event lobby does not take the player to the next available tournament.
  |
| Play Lobby | Paused Leagues are incorrectly not identified as such in the Play Lobby. |
| Play Lobby | The text displayed in the search bar when filtering the Play lobby to display Leagues reads “Search Constructed Tournaments Games / Players” instead of “Search Constructed League Games / Players”. Filtering for Limited Leagues will show a similar error. |
| Sideboard | Extra cards are sometimes added to a player's deck in addition to their choices when sideboarding. 
  |
| Trade | After clicking the Submit button in a trade, if a player adds or removes cards from the trade, the trade is still incorrectly submitted from his or her trade partner’s side. Toast messaging—messages that pop up on your screen to alert you—does display in this scenario warning players that the trade proposal has changed, and each player will have an opportunity to confirm the trade before it is performed. |
| Trade | If a player opens a booster pack that is in their active trade binder, attempting to trade a different booster pack from the same set cancels the trade. Logging out and then back in will correct this issue.
  |
| Trade | New trade windows do not always appear in front of other windows. These windows are still accessible via the *Magic Online* program icon in the taskbar. |
| Trade | Occasionally when using the Search Tool to filter a players collection, players will incorrectly receive list of cards that are unavailable when they are actually available. 
  |
| Trade | The Search Tool is not present in the Other Products tab of a trade.  |
