Okay, this might be a little self-indulgent. On the other hand, people like it when we show pictures of the Wizards of the Coast offices, so it might be fine.

The **magicthegathering.com** team (Monty Ashley, Greg Collins, Kelly Digges, Tom Jenkot, and Scott Johns) recently got moved into The Pit, which is where **Magic** R&D works. That's pretty cool, right? Here, check out our new cubes:

And here's our view of the rest of the Pit:

This also means that we have our own whiteboard, which means that we can bring back important questions like [Is Gum Food?](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/mr147_gum.jpg). Until we get that going, though, have a challenge!
