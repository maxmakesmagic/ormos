A reporter is sent out to interview an old Indian that supposedly has the best memory of any person alive. The reporter feels the entire story is stupid, but knows he has no choice but to write a story. So, the reporter meets the Indian. He asks how old the Indian is. The Indian says 71. He asks what the Indian wore on a certain date years earlier. The Indian says he wore his traditional Indian garb. The reporter then asks what the Indian did that day. The Indian replies that he went to his job at the local general store. 


A bit exasperated at the vague answers, the reporter asks one final question. “What did you have for breakfast on that day?” “Eggs,” the Indian replied.


With that the reporter had enough and left the interview. He ended up writing a bland feature article and put the whole incident behind him.


Thirteen years later, the reporter has another story at the reservation. This time it has to do with graft at the Indian casino. As he's walking in the front gate, he sees the old Indian. Trying to be polite, he says hello with the one word he knows of the Indian's language, “How!”
