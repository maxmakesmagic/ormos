**Card of the Day - jeudi 31 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Urza's%20Rage)#### Urza's Rage


 *Invasion* rare. The "gun" on top of Urza's Titan Suit is not in fact a gun at all; it's really a magical tuning fork that helps Urza cast spells. That's why the fireballs are appearing out of nowhere instead of being projected from the suit itself.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 30 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rishadan%20Airship)#### Rishadan Airship


 *Mercadian Masques* common. This card is a lot more fun when you picture the pirates on the airship leaping from blimp to blimp with their cutlasses in their mouths, trying desperately not to puncture anything.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 29 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Okiba-Gang%20Shinobi)#### Okiba-Gang Shinobi


 *Betrayers of Kamigawa* common. It probably comes as quite a surprise when that seemingly-innocuous Birds of Paradise or Ornithopter suddenly turns out to be a humanoid rat that's been trained in the deadly arts. That would be startling enough to make anyone lose some cards.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 28 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tree%20Monkey)#### Tree Monkey


 *Portal Second Age* common. Unlike most monkeys in **Magic**, the Tree Monkey (and Zodiac Monkey from *Portal: Three Kingdoms*) has the creature type "Monkey", not "Ape". This is just one of the ways in which **Magic** does not conform to Earth's division of species.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 25 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Zodiac%20Rabbit)#### Zodiac Rabbit


 *Portal Three Kingdoms* common. Though there are several cards that show or mention rabbits in **Magic** (see any of the cards from this week’s Card of the Day for examples), Zodiac Rabbit is the only card in the game that actually *has* creature type: Rabbit. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 24 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ebon%20Praetor)#### Ebon Praetor


 *Fallen Empires* rare. Players often assumed that the Praetor is the bunny, but Praetor is defined as: “an ancient Roman magistrate ranking below a consul and having chiefly judicial functions.” So, it turns out the Praetor is the official in the background, presumably presiding over some kind of judicial matter.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 23 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vizzerdrix)#### Vizzerdrix


 *Starter 1999* rare. On Monday’s Card of the Day we told you how Kezzerdrix and Orgg were selected for a commercial campaign. R&D wanted to include these cards in the next set since they were out of print, but they were too complicated for Starter… which is how the cards Vizzerdrix and Trained Orgg came into being! 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 22 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=When%20Fluffy%20Bunnies%20Attack)#### When Fluffy Bunnies Attack


 *Unhinged* common. Like Prodigal Sorcerer's nickname "Tim", this card is a nod to the 1975 film *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*. (In addition to the name, note the cave in the background as well.) Given the art, it's funny that when this card was designed the only dragons in **Magic** this card could actually kill were Alabaster, Fledgling, and Nalathni! 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 21 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kezzerdrix)#### Kezzerdrix


 *Tempest* rare. When Wizards of the Coast hired an advertising agency to put together TV commercials for **Magic**, the agency went through all of the cards printed and picked two creatures to feature. The winners were Kezzerdrix and Orgg. (Lucky you, today’s Magic Arcana features the Kezzerdrix ad!)
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 18 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Muscle%20Sliver)#### Muscle Sliver


 *Tempest* common. The first card to strictly obsolete Grizzly Bears, R&D debated long and hard over creating Muscle Sliver as you know it. In the end though, the card you see is exactly the same form as its original design version (not counting the design name of “Green Sliver”). 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 17 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Howling%20Wolf)#### Howling Wolf


 *Mercadian Masques* common. This card was inspired by the much earlier Llanowar Sentinel, from *Weatherlight*. In turn, Howling Wolf inspired the *Onslaught* searching creature cycle, which included cards like Avarax and Embermage Goblin. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 16 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kindle)#### Kindle


 *Tempest* common. This card was called Ion Charge during design, and was concepted by Mark Rosewater as a way to bring something of a Plague Rats mechanic to spells. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 15 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ember-Fist%20Zubera)#### Ember-Fist Zubera


 *Champions of Kamigawa* common. The first Zubera, this one was so popular that it ended up inspiring an entire cycle. Interestingly, all of the Zubera were 1/1’s for 2 mana, but they proved to be ridiculous with Skullclamp (still legal at that time) so each was given an extra toughness to make them *worse!*



**Card of the Day - lundi 14 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Myr%20Servitor)#### Myr Servitor


 *Fifth Dawn* common. Called “Robo-Roach” in design, the flavor behind this card was that, like roaches, if you didn’t kill all of them they’d just keep coming back. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 11 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Eternal%20Witness)#### Eternal Witness


 *Fifth Dawn* uncommon. During design this was a 2/2 but had a casting cost of ![3 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_3_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)! During development it was lowered to four and then to the casting cost on the printed version. At ![1 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif) she’s amazing, but it’s hard to imagine paying 2 more mana just for 1 extra point of toughness. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 10 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kiku,%20Night's%20Flower)#### Kiku, Night's Flower


 *Champions of Kamigawa* rare. This card was designed by concept first: an assassin that killed by animating the victim’s shadow. Though the resulting ability ended up being an effect normally associated with white (see Repentance), the flavor of the card was still a fine fit for black. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 9 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Glissa%20Sunseeker)#### Glissa Sunseeker


 *Mirrodin* rare. Because she was an existing character, here is roughly what the design team knew when it was time to create this card: “She destroys artifacts and uses mana somehow.” The resulting ability based on mana in the pool (but not using it) is unique to the game. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 8 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vulshok%20Sorcerer)#### Vulshok Sorcerer


 *Fifth Dawn* common. Some thought this card’s art was a mistake based on the name, but “sorcerer” is actually not gender specific. Though “sorceress” was used twice in **Magic**’s early days, “sorcerer” is now used for both sexes. (Note that this allows new art for these cards to be either sex as needed.) 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 7 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Azusa,%20Lost%20but%20Seeking)#### Azusa, Lost but Seeking


 *Champions of Kamigawa*  rare. During design this card originally allowed you to play as many lands as you wanted in a turn, but this quickly proved to be way too good in combination with the Soratami abilities (among other things). 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 4 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Soldevi%20Adnate)#### Soldevi Adnate


 *Alliances* common. Sometimes different cards get their art from the same illustration, but in this case the opposite happened – the original piece by Christopher Rush was split into halves and used for two different versions of the card. Click here and here to see the results. If you look closely you can see the shoulder of one Adnate in the art of the other!
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 3 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Braids,%20Cabal%20Minion)#### Braids, Cabal Minion


 *Odyssey* rare. This art by Eric Peterson was originally intended for Diabolic Tutor but it was so impressive that R&D went back and created the card Braids, Cabal Minion just to give the illustration a home that seemed more fitting. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 2 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dwarven%20Shrine)#### Dwarven Shrine


 *Odyssey* rare. The art description just required this to be a memorial to red **Magic**, but artist Matt Cavotta plays the game as well, so this piece is chock-full of images from famous red cards. As you can see in this blown-up version, the art includes (among others) The Hammer of Bogardan, a Rukh Egg, Ball Lightning, and even promo card Nalathni Dragon! 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 1 mars 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sage%20Owl)#### Sage Owl


 *Weatherlight* common. **Magic** art often contains references to other cards if you look closely enough. In the original art for Sage Owl by Mark Poole, take a close look at that framed picture in the background…you might recognize it from another Mark Poole card!
