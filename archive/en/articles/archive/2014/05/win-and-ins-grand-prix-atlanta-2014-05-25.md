Eight players entered the feature match area for the last round of Swiss in Atlanta. Four left as happy top 8 competitors and four left disappointed losing the last round barely missing the draft for the title.



**(12) Shaun McLaren (Blue/White) vs. (5) Owen Turtenwald (4 color [Boulderfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boulderfall))** 




 Owen Turtenwald's deck was one of the more interesting as the day drew to an end in Atlanta. Running four colors with mana fix like [Market Festival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Market+Festival) and strong cards from all colors but Blue it looked quite sweet. But it was Shaun McLaren, and his Blue/White deck that drew the longest straw when they battled for top 8. The Canadian took Game One on the back of unblockable creatures like [Flitterstep Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flitterstep+Eidolon) and [Whitewater Naiads](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitewater+Naiads), locking down Turtenwald's creatures with [Thassa's Ire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Ire). And in the second game a strong curve of [Flitterstep Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flitterstep+Eidolon) into [Bident of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa) got him far enough ahead that he could dispatch Turtenwald who would have to settle for cheering for his teammate William Jensen in the top 8.




**Shaun McLaren 2 – 0 Owen Turtenwald**




**Nathan Holiday (Black/Green/Red) vs. Tomaharo Saito (Blue/Black)**




 Nathan Holiday went into the last draft needing only two wins to guarantee his spot in the top 8. And his deck was looking good. Sporting a Green/Black base, splashing Red for [Xenagos, the Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) and [Underworld Cerberus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Cerberus). It even had a [Pharika, God of Affliction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%2C+God+of+Affliction) for added mythic value. Unfortunately for him, Japanese veteran Tomaharo Saito had other plans, as his King-Macar, the Gold-Cursed locked down Game One. Game Two looked incredibly close, and Saito had to draw his sixth land the specific turn he did to be able to [Thwart](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thwart) Holiday's team with a [Sea God's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+God%27s+Revenge) just in time to race with a [Nimbus Naiad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad) he fetched from his deck with [Disciple of Deceit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Deceit). In the end, Holiday couldn't deal lethal before the Naiad and [Pharika, God of Affliction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%2C+God+of+Affliction) could only watch, never being transformed into a creature to attack Holiday into the top 8.




**Tomaharo Saito 2 – 0 Nathan Holiday**




**(19) Shuhei Nakamura (Green/Blue/Red) vs. Charley Murdock (Red/White)**




 The other match between Japan and the US for a seat in the top 8 draft also came down to three games. The players split the first games when [Hydra Broodmaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydra+Broodmaster) won one for Nakamura and [Portent of Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Portent+of+Betrayal) (on the Broodmaster) one for Murdock. In the decider Nakamura stalled on three lands after casting [Swordwise Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swordwise+Centaur), [Hall of Triumph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hall+of+Triumph) and a Cackling Triton, while Murdock was able to Oppressive Ray the Centaur, burn away the Cackling Triton while mounting his own offense with fast beaters like [Arena Athlete](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena+Athlete), [Spearpoint Oread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spearpoint+Oread) and an [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid), growing his Athlete. The game ending [Portent of Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Portent+of+Betrayal) just added insult to the injury when Nakamura finally found a fourth land to cast a [Nylea's Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple). He conceded in the face of a [Flurry of Horns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flurry+of+Horns) on Murdock's next turn.  




**Jeremy Clunan (Blue/White) vs (18) Chris Fennell (Green/Blue)** 




 Chris Fennell has been on somewhat of a streak lately, adding fine finishes to his resume that already has 4 Grand Prix top 8 including one win in it. In what turned out to be the most lopsided match for top 8, his Green/Blue deck made short work of Jeremy Clunan's Blue/White one. Game Two looked like it might go to Clunan, after he summoned two copies of [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary) and Fennell was mostly on lands. But Fennell came back with a [Rise of Eagles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+of+Eagles), a [Retraction Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retraction+Helix) (on a double enchanted Emissary) and drew the [Desecration Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Plague) he had sideboarded in to get rid of the last of Emissary and sealed his spot in the top 8.
