 Despite playing in just his fourth Pro Tour, Japan's Yuuki Ichikawa has already notched his second Top 8. In fact, he was the only player this season to make a repeat appearance on Sunday. He's hoping to improve on his Top 4 finish at Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* and hoist the trophy this weekend. Sweetening the pot a little for him is the fact that if he can win this quarterfinal match, he will oust Yuuya Watanabe as captain of the Japanese National Team.




 Opposite him sits a player whose career has taken its first big step forward. Jackson Cunningham, brother to the noted wit and Canadian National Treasure Jeff Cunningham. Now he's out of Jeff's shadow and into the limelight. You'd forgive a PTQ winner for showing nerves as he makes a bid for greatness, but all weekend Cunningham has impressed with calm, deliberate play.




**The Decks**




 Ichikawa is playing an updated version of the popular Jund 'Walkers deck, taking advantage of the awesome power of *Magic 2015*'s [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker). His deck boasts an impressive eleven planeswalkers alongside an acceleration package of [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) and [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid). The ubiquitous [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) is here, naturally, and a small but versatile removal package rounds things out.




 Cunningham has been clubbing opponents all weekend with a Green-White Beatdown deck reminiscent of the one that Craig Wescoe used to win Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze* last year. It boasts a tight curve of efficient creatures, using [Banishing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light) to remove obstacles and gets finishing power from the versatile [Selesnya Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Charm) as well as the deadly [Ajani, Caller of the Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Caller+of+the+Pride).




**The Games**




 "Did you sleep last night?" Cunningham asked.



Ichikawa shrugged and made a face. "Only... so-so."



 I asked Cunningham if he'd managed to get any.



"Not really. It's hard. You have all this anxiety, and it's 11 o'clock and you need to eat and go to sleep."



 Ichikawa kept his opening seven. Cunningham was frowning at his, but after a long think he chose to keep.






*While Jackson Cunningham aimed to make his first Pro Tour a memorable one, Ichikawa was within striking distance of World *Magic* Cup captaincy with a win here.*
