### The Story


Rich Kraupa spent his qualifying season in a series of near-misses, only to earn an invitation to Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* the hard way with his Top 8 appearance here at Toronto. Two-Time Grand Prix Champion Seth Manfield also scored an invite to Valencia, which lets him defer his Silver Status invite to Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* in Atlanta. Now it's time to battle for gold and glory.

*Richard Kraupa*

Kraupa has a stocked blue-black deck that can bury the opponent in card advantage. Manfield's red-green aggro deck hopes to end the game before that can happen.


### The Match


Game one was a brutal lopsided affair. Kraupa's first play of [Returned Phalanx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Phalanx) fell to [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), then he took four from [Minotaur Skullcleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Skullcleaver). He played out a [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter), but Manfield suited up with [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad) and made it another four. Kraupa tried to fight back with [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide), but Manfield just rebuilt his board and then served up [Portent of Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Portent+of+Betrayal) to put the game away.


Game two was more Kraupa's speed. Manfield stumbled off the starting blocks, and after trading [Sedge Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedge+Scorpion) for [Fleshmad Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshmad+Steed) he couldn't find another threat until [Ill-Tempered Cyclops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ill-Tempered+Cyclops). When Manfield went for the monstrous, Kraupa was ready with [Lash of the Whip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+of+the+Whip). [Disciple of Phenax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax) made sure the path was clear, and then Kraupa started chaining enchantments on [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter). The game was soon his.

*Seth Manfield*

Manfield was back on the play and made the most of it. He got a quick six in with [Arena Athlete](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena+Athlete) and [Minotaur Skullcleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Skullcleaver) before Kraupa could get on the board. Kraupa summoned [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter), but was forced to block a second Skullcleaver and fell to just ten.


However, Manfield had stalled on three mountains. Kraupa played [Disciple of Phenax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax), stealing [Destructive Revelry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Revelry). Manfield untapped and drew. He swung in with his Skullcleaver but couldn't punish a block. He passed the turn without playing a card. Another Disciple from Kraupa laid his secrets bare: A hand full of green cards: [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad), [Feral Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Invocation), [Savage Surge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Surge) and [Fade into Antiquity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fade+into+Antiquity). A forest would make all the difference, but it was not to be. Kraupa bestowed a pair of [Nimbus Naiad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad)s on a second Fortune Hunter, and soon he was on to the semifinals.


### The Aftermath


Kraupa seemed almost apologetic about the conclusion to the match. Nobody likes a non-game, even when it ends in your favor. Manfield was gracious in defeat, shaking Kraupa's hand and wishing him luck in the Top 4.
