The preliminary rounds of the Duelist Invitational will be fifteen matches (best two out of three) with each player facing off against every other player once. The two players with the best record at the end of the fifteen rounds will meet in a three out of five duel final match. The constructed format of the final match will be decided by a preference list created by all the players before play begins. The fifteen rounds will consist of six different formats: three constructed and three limited. The constructed formats will each be used for three matches while the limited formats will each be used for two matches.


### Constructed Formats


You will need to construct the following three decks for the Invitational: 


1) **Standard (Type II)** - The follwing sets will be used for this format: Fourth Edition, Chronicles, Alliances, Mirage, Visions. [Reminder: As of January 1, there is no restricted list for Type II, all previously restricted cards have been banned.]


2) **Classic Restricted (Type I.V), Highlander Style** - All non-banned cards in this format are restricted to one card per deck (including the sideboard). [Reminder: As of January 1, any card restricted or banned in either Type I or II is banned in Type I.V.]


3) **Classic (Type I), New York Style** - All decks for this format must contain at least four cards (in either the main deck or sideboard) from each of the following sets: Unlimited Edition (2nd Edition of the Gathering), *Arabian Nights*, *Antiquities*, *Legends*, *The Dark*, *Fallen Empires*, *Ice Age*, *Alliances*, *Mirage*, *Visions*.


### Limited Formats


For all limited events, the card mix will not be announced until directly before the event. Also, all limited events will have a forty card deck minimum size restriction. The following are the limited formats used at the 1997 Duelist Invitational:


1) **Traditional** - This is a standard DCI sealed event.


2) **Solomon** - This is a two player draft format. The players shuffle all the cards provided together. A randomly selected player then begins by flipping up eight cards from the top of the card pile. He divides the eight cards into two piles (the piles need not be of the same size) allowing the other player to chose which pile to draft. The two players alternate dividing and drafting until all the cards have been selected.


3) **Backdraft** - This is similar to a booster draft but with an interesting twist: you want to draft the worst cards possible since you will be playing against your own drafted cards. After you've finished drafting, find your assigned opponent and swap cards. Strip the deck and add land. After the match, each player takes back their deck and moves on to the next opponent.
