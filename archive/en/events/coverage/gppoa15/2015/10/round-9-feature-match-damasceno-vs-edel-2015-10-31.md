Crawling back from a 0-2 start, newly-inducted Hall of Famer Willy Edel had preferred not to be in this predicament in the first place. However, rattling off three straight wins with his trusty Jund deck, he finds himself faced against Joaquim Damasceno, an experienced pilot of little blue men.


While Edel's plan is to kill anything that moves while beating down to [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s, Damasceno would need to play the tempo game and have sufficient ways to outlast the attrition.


Game 1
======


Edel had mulliganed to five, and quickly faced pressure from [Cursecatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursecatcher) (cheated out via *[Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial)*) and [Harbinger of the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbinger+of+the+Tides). [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) removed [Master of the Pearl Trident](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Pearl+Trident), but that didn't stop Damasceno from “vialing” out [Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis) as the replacement.


Being low on resources, Edel declined to trade with his [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant). That forced Damasceno to [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) it, preventing Edel from refueling. [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) was the last-ditch effort, but Damasceno was able to “vial” out another Lord after tossing [Cursecatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursecatcher) in the bin.


Just like that the Hall of Famer was down on game. Back against the wall.

**Joaquim Damasceno 1 – Willy Edel 0**


Game 2
======


Once again, Damasceno had the *[Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial)*, but had no one drops or two drops. He did have [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus) though, making Edel's next two cards ([Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze)) rather lackluster.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kira%2C+Great+Glass-Spinner)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kira%2C+Great+Glass-Spinner)
Hardcasting [Kira, Great Glass-Spinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kira%2C+Great+Glass-Spinner), Edel tried to kill it with [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil), but Damasceno simply vialed out a freshly-drawn [Master of the Pearl Trident](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Pearl+Trident) as sacrificial fodder. The 2/2 flier finished off the Planeswalker the next turn, and Damasceno ensured that both yards were spick and span with a second copy of [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus).


With *[Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial)* ticking up to three, that only meant that Damasceno was out of threats, other than Merrow Rejeerey, which joined the board along with [Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis).


When Edel tried [Night of Souls' Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+of+Souls%27+Betrayal), that was stopped by [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate). To make matters worse, Damasceno had elected to tick [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) up to 4. Was it a ruse?

*Joaquim Damasceno rides his Merfolk to Day 2!*


Regardless, he had the [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) to Islandwalk his way to victory. Even after Edel had used [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay), [Terminate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) and [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) to rid himself of a trio of creatures, a pair of [Vapor Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag)s cleared away the [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) and [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) for him to sneak in the final few damage.


Damasceno had all the cards needed to beat the Hall of Famer, played excellently and never missed a trigger. Sorry about the bad run Willy, we'll see you at Grand Prix Atlanta. =)
