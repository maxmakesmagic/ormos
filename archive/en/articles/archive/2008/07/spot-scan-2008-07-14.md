As you know, we occasionally feature scans in our articles. And we also have images or gimmicks that require a bit of planning. What you might *not* know is that Monty Ashley saves most of the scans and notes that go into making the website. In fact, a lot of them are on the wall of his cubicle right now!


So here's what we're going to do. We've got a picture here of Monty's tableau. Mouse over something to see it enlarged, and click on it to go to the article where it first appeared. It'll be fun! Really!
