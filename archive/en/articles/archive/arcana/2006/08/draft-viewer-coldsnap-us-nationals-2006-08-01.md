The [Draft Viewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/magic/draftools/draftviewer.asp?draftid=7_29_2006_1_1_1_1) is back! Table 1 had four people that would end up in the Top 8 (Luis-Scott Vargas and Paul Cheon, who both made the team; Ben Zoz, the alternate; and Alex Kudlick), two big-time pros (Gabe Walls and Billy Moreno), and Ken Nowell and Owen Turtenwald, who stood at 6-1 after seven grueling rounds of Constructed (Standard) and Draft (Ravnica Block).

The Draft Viewer allows you to watch every aspect of a draft: every decision affects all the other players, so you can watch a single pack as it flies around the table, or just stick with one player and watch what he picks. Watching eight players on the top of their game is one of the best ways to get better!

One of the peculiarities of drafting triple-*Coldsnap* is that, since it's three packs of a small set, players have the opportunity to draft multiples of key cards. To be a top drafter, one has to carefully balance that against the need to draft Snow-Covered Lands before they're all gone.

Incidentally, two people first-picked [Zombie Musher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Musher): one went 3-0 and the other went 0-3. Go figure.
