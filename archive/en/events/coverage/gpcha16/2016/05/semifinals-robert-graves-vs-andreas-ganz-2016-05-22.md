The hall was quiet and a cluster of spectators leaned against the rail of the hall's feature match area as the Grand Prix's two semifinal matches began. The face off between Andreas Ganz and Robert Graves began with Ganz taking a mulligan while across the table Graves, on the play, kept seven.


Each player developed their game plan, though not necessarily their board, in the early turns of game one. Graves curved a turn one [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) into a turn two [Fulminator Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage). He chose to apply pressure to Ganz's life total by attacking with [Fulminator Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage) as Ganz cultivated his mana and his draws with a suspended [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom), a [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), and a [Pentad Prism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentad+Prism).


On turn four Graves went for [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker). Ganz countered it with a [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation) and Graves had to content himself with attacking for two and passing the turn.


In his upkeep Ganz put his Pact and [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) triggers on the stack before casting an [Angel's Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel%27s+Grace) to avoid paying for the Pact.

The danger of losing the game out of the way, Ganz proceeded to cast [Spoils of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spoils+of+the+Vault) naming [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam). The spell resolved and he began revealing cards from the top of his library.


The pieces looked to be in place for Ganz to take game one until he flipped over a [Laboratory Maniac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laboratory+Maniac). Unfazed, he continued turning cards over from the top of his deck and putting them in his graveyard. Then, Ganz paused as he put a [Lightning Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm) into his graveyard.


“Are those your win conditions?” Graves asked.


“Yeah.”


“That's one way to win I guess,” Graves said as Ganz shook his head and gathered up his cards.


Ganz chuckled and shook his head. “It just makes the deck look bad” he lamented.


“No, I know it's pretty unlikely,” Graves told him.

Game two began with Ganz again taking a mulligan, but quickly keeping his six-card hand.


An early [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) from Ganz took a [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) from Graves, leaving him with a [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence), a [Fulminator Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage), and a [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix), but no other action. Graves played the Voice and once again began pressuring Ganz's life total.


Ganz put [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam) in his hand by scrying to the top with a [Temple of Enlightenment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Enlightenment) and then casting [Spoils of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spoils+of+the+Vault). On his next turn Graves used [Fulminator Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage) to destroy Ganz's [Darkslick Shores](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Shores), his only source of black mana.


Unfortunately for Graves, Ganz had a [Gemstone Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Mine) and [Phyrexian Unlife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Unlife) on his next turn, followed by two [Temple of Deceit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Deceit)s on subsequent turns.


Despite a handful of draw steps and an extra draw from a [Horizon Canopy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Canopy), Graves didn't have a way to disrupt Ganz when Ganz cast [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam) a few turns later, and Graves scooped game two to Ganz.


Both players kept their opening hands at the start of game three and the deciding game began, both players developing their mana with a turn one Birds from Graves and a suspended [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) from Ganz.


A [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) from Ganz took a [Nahiri, the Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nahiri%2C+the+Harbinger) from Graves's hand, but an [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) returned it to his grip and the planeswalker hit the table, discarding a [Reclamation Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclamation+Sage) in favor of an unknown card.


But on his next turn Ganz cast [Angel's Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel%27s+Grace), followed by the [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam). With no answers in hand, Graves his hand and Ganz breathed a sigh of relief.


“After game one I was afraid my deck was letting me down,” Ganz said.


“No,” Graves replied, “I think that would be my deck.”
