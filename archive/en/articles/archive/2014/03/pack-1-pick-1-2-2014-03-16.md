Sometimes the packs are kind, and you sit down to a draft confronted with an obviously busted rare. Most of the time, however, your first pick requires careful weighing of close alternatives. Remember: Your chance at a Top 8 hinges on this decision. No pressure. Click below to see the pack and make your decision.


You have 40 seconds...


Ready, Set, Draft!

"I'd be happy to open this pack. I'm taking a great red card and passing a bunch of green, which doesn't go well with red anyways. I'll be looking to be Red-White or Red-Black."


  
Reid Duke selects...

"[Fated Intervention](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Intervention) is a powerful card, but that could be a [Nessian Asp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp), or a [Nemesis of Mortals](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis+of+Mortals) or even a [Snake of the Golden Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+of+the+Golden+Grove) and your deck won't be that much worse. The good two-drops are harder to come by. You'd much rather have too many twos than too many fives."

"These picks are so much harder when there's no white cards. Really I'm mentally flipping a coin here between this and [Bolt of Keranos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bolt+of+Keranos). Some people like [Sudden Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm) more, and that's a fine pick too."
