*What card from the [Innistrad Card Image Gallery](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/innistrad/cig) are you most hoping to open at the Prerelease, and why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kennagle.jpg)**Kenneth Nagle:** There's an ongoing joke about me opening booster packs and telling everyone what cards I designed ([like so](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQPMwHnpai4)), but I was actually a developer on *Innistrad* rather than a designer. I do hope to announce to passersby the cards I designed (like Bonds of Faith and Skeletal Grimace) as I open them, but the card I'm really hoping to open (but didn't design) is a premium Ludevic's Test Subject!

During *Innistrad* development Sealed playtests, I cast this card no fewer than five times, and each time it hatched into a 13/13 trampler and killed my opponent. The card got slight improvements over time because everyone loved it, especially me. The largest blue creature ever printed, Ludevic's Abomination has a special place in my heart (and deck) for those times when my opponent needs to be attacked in 13-point chunks mitigated by toughness.
