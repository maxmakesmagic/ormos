Yes, that's a foil Nissa Revane. And you want one.


Here's how to get one. If you are eligible to receive the promo card (see [Terms & Conditions](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/digital/duelsoftheplaneswalkers.aspx?x=mtg/digital/dotp/terms)) then select **View Games Library** off of the **Games** tab on your Steam window, right click on Magic: The Gathering – Duels of the Planeswalkers and click on **Register your game** to register. Grab yours now before they are gone! (while supplies last – restrictions apply)


Duels of the Planeswalkers players will enjoy the benefits of the Steamworks's features included in all PC versions, such as auto-updating, Steam Achievements, Leaderboards, downloadable content, ability to access from any computer, multiplayer matchmaking and more.
