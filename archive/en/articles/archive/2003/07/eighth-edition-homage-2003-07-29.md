By now you've seen some of the new *Eighth Edition* card art, and may have noticed that some of the "new" illustrations bear likeness to their cards' original art. This was indeed intentional. Commissioning "homage" artwork allows us to update illustrations while at the same time recognizing the game's illustrious past.


You've already seen side-by-side comparisons of old and new [Skull of Orm](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/8erollout/thedark) and [Savannah Lions](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/8erollout/alpha) artwork from the *Eighth Edition* Rollout; here are four more *Eighth Edition* cards with art that pays tribute to the old school.


### Blood Moon



### Lhurgoyf



### Spirit Link



### Urza's Mine
