![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a855.jpg)There were some snickers in the back room over Brian Kibler's first pick [Battlefield Medic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic) but the [Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon)master is confident in the cleric archetype. He looks very confident clad in Superman t-shirt with his high-end headphones blaring what could be virtually any style of music. Rood is also confident and no one is making fun of his first picks in *Onslaught*—Exalted Angel and [Insurrection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insurrection). 

### Game 1

Rood was forced to mulligan his opening hand but kept the next six. Both players laid [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) on the first turn but Rood seemed to anticipate Kibler's deck when he announced a [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) during Kibler's upkeep. "[Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)ing," grinned Kibler as he played a [Starlight Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starlight+Invoker). Rood was scooping up the soldiers that Kibler was forgoing and he played a [Gustcloak Harrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier) and a [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) on the next two turns. The game was shaping up to be a [Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier)s vs. Clerics damage race with 4 in that air racing fourth turn [Vile Deacon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Deacon) and fifth turn [Daunting Defender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender) when Rood unmorphed an [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) on his sixth turn and flew over for 8 damage and gained four. "That card cost me soooooo much money at Masters," grinned Rood. The life totals were Rood = 15 and Kibler = 6.

Kibler did some quick math and was sporting a grin of his own. He played a [Crown of Suspicion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Suspicion) on his [Daunting Defender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender) and attacked with it, [Starlight Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starlight+Invoker), a 5/5 [Vile Deacon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Deacon) and a morph. Rood had no blockers and Kibler sac's the crown to give all his clerics the bonus and he dealt an unexpected 17 damage to the stunned Rood. "[Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) my ass!" proclaimed Kibler. When told of the play Randy Buehler concurred, "[Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) is no [Crown of Suspicion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Suspicion)!"

Kibler – 1 Rood – 0

### Game 2

There were no mulligans this time and Rood played a third turn morph as did Kibler. Dive Bomber and [Vile Deacon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Deacon) were the fourth turn plays and Rood dealt first blood with his flier and followed it up with [Snapping Thragg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Thragg). Kibler played an [Akroma's Devoted](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Devoted) and sent his [Vile Deacon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Deacon) upright into the red zone. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a857.jpg)Rood sent his Thragg and a morph at Kibler. The [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) stayed back to deal with the Deacon. Kibler put his morph and Devoted in the way of the beast and it ate the mystery man—a [Wingbeat Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingbeat+Warrior). Rood followed up with a pair of morphs. [Daunting Defender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender) negated the [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) and the Devoted and Deacon—can you call it swinging if they don't tap?—swung into the red zone.

Rood kept the pressure on Kibler and swung with three morphs and a [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber). Kibler thought long and hard about his blocks and went over the math multiple times before putting a [Daunting Defender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender) in front of one morph and [Akroma's Devoted](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Devoted) in front of another. Letting a morph and the flier though unimpeded. "No [Searing Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Flesh) for you!" exclaimed Kibler."   
 Rood nodded, "There were sooooo many in that draft."

"I passed two of them and I have no desire to fall to six," Kibler elaborated. Rood tapped all of his mana and unmorphed the guy the Defender was blocking—a [Rockshard Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rockshard+Elemental)—obviously annoyed that that wasn't the morph that got through but happy to kill the annoying 'Double D'. The race was now Rood = 9 Kibler = 8.

[Whipgrass Entangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipgrass+Entangler) gave Kibler a burst of adrenaline for the race and Devoted and Deacon went into the red zone straight up for seven more points. Rood = 2 Kibler = 8.

Rood played a [Goblin Sledder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder) and announced his attack. Entangler requested that [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) and Rockshard pay 3 mana each to attack and the Elemental obliged. Kibler had to give up a cleric and he made the face of unpleasant choices before deciding to give up his Deacon, which the [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) could take care of anyway. Rood played a [Sandskin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandskin) on the Devoted and passed the turn. 

Kibler clearly had something up his sleeve when he attacked with his [Sandskin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandskin)ned devoted and Rood wasn't taking any chances. He double blocked and Kibler just shrugged and let them bounce, saving whatever he had for later and played out a morph.

Rood was concerned about the Entangler and was playing out all of his lands leaving him devoid of cards in hand to mount a bluff. With the Deacon gone he was able to get in for two with the Bomber and took Kibler to a tantalizing six. Kibler couldn't break through and played another Deacon rather than trying, which prompted a "Dear God" form Rood. A [Battering Craghorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battering+Craghorn) was unveiled EOT.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a856.jpg)During his next turn's upkeep Rood invoked the Canadian patron saint of topdecks with a, "C'mon Fung!" his deck only offered [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), which he played to keep up with the Entangler. Kibler played Sootfeather flock.

Rood was finally rewarded with a topdecked [Crested Craghorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crested+Craghorn), which traded with the Entangler. Kibler had been holding the [Cruel Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival)—it was his ace up the sleeve when he attacked with the devoted earlier—and killed the [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) and finished off the young Canadian.

**Final Result:** Kibler – 2 Rood – 0

Brian Kibler: "I haven't lost a game since round two! I lost my first two rounds and I haven't lost since."

Rood nodded, "That is the deck I wanted to draft. I was talking with Hoaen last night and he asked what do you do in this situation. 'You have first picked Cruel revival and the second pack has [Battlefield Medic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic) and [Barkhide Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler). What do you take?' 

Kibler: "You take the cleric, clearly!"

Rood: "Not many people would do that but Hoaen went 7-0 with that strategy yesterday!"
