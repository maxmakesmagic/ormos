![Player Reward](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/dci/images/Magic_PlayerRewards_Logo.jpg)Two new token cards are already in the mail to Player Reward members.


The first is a 1/1 green Insect token that can be used in conjunction with lots of cards, from [Saber Ants](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saber+Ants) to the *Onslaught* [Symbiotic Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Symbiotic%2BBeast) to [Wirewood Hivemaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Hivemaster).


The second is a 1/1 colorless Sliver token, which works perfectly with not only [Brood Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brood+Sliver), but the [Sliver Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen) as well!
