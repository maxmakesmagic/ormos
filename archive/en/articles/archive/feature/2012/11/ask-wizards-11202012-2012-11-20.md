**Q:**  Following Hurricane Sandy, I wanted to know, is Grand Prix Atlantic City still happening? - Christian W.


**A:** Yes it is! Hélène Bergeot [confirmed on Twitter](https://twitter.com/HeleneBergeot/status/266367021430738945) that the event is still taking place, and the venue is at the Atlantic City Convention Center.

**Q:** When will we see new *Gatecrash* cards? —Isto H. 

**A:** Trick Jarrett, Editor-in-Chief of DailyMTG.com


Ah yes, I know it's nearing preview season as I get this question more and more frequently. *Gatecrash* preview week kicks off on New Year's Eve; be sure to come see the new articles and cards about the upcoming set!


But, just between you and me, you might want to keep an eye on DailyMTG.com the week before, too. We might have some winter gifts in store for you all.
