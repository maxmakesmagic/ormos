B*etrayers of Kamigawa's* 
**[Stir the Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stir+the+Grave)**, a reanimation spell found in Gadiel Szleifer's winning [Pro Tour Philadelphia deck](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/decklists-top-8-decks-2005-05-07), depicts a typical, zombie-filled reanimation scene: 

If you look closely, the art contains references to *two* other *Champions of Kamigawa* legends.

![Nighteyes the Desecrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nighteyes+the+Desecrator)The first is [Nighteyes the Desecrator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nighteyes+the+Desecrator) -- the "leveled-up" version of [Nezumi Graverobber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Graverobber), also in Gadiel's deck (sideboarded). Nighteyes is the necromancer seen in the background raising all those zombies. 

The second legend shown in [Stir the Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stir+the+Grave) is more subtle. According to the art description, the entire scene takes place at the haunted, legendary battlefield [Shizo, Death's Storehouse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shizo%2C+Death%27s+Storehouse) (which is *also* in Gadiel's deck)!

You might say that in such a flavor-filled block, theme decks win Pro Tours!
