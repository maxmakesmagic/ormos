Mark your calendars for the Assault on Mirrodin, coming September 4!


This special event will be taking place at both Pro Tour–Amsterdam and PAX Prime in Seattle as we kick off the preview season for *Scars of Mirrodin*. Each location will have an "Assault on Mirrodin" party Saturday night where you can see exclusive preview cards and new art from the upcoming set.


The assault begins in Amsterdam at the end of Day Two of the Pro Tour (and after an interactive puzzle hunt). At 9 p.m. the Amsterdam Convention Factory will transform into a nightclub featuring a live DJ, **Magic**-themed puzzles and activities, and free food. The Amsterdam party runs until midnight and is open to everyone.

Just as the Amsterdam party is winding down, the action will be heating up in Seattle during PAX Prime. Hundreds of lucky players will convene at Showbox at the Market at 6 p.m. in downtown Seattle to see more card previews and art, as well as a sneak peek at the PS3 version of *Duels of the Planeswalkers*. The Assault culminates with an interactive puzzle to test your wits, with the savvy winner taking home a big prize (along with smaller door prizes for everyone). Free food and drinks will be served while guests mingle with Magic artists and R&D members who make the game what it is. 


To get invited to the Seattle party, you'll need to overcome the challenges of five locations throughout the Washington State Convention & Trade Center. Successfully solve the puzzles at each of the five stations and earn the right to attend this way-out sneak preview of **Magic** goodness.\* For more information, email assaultonmirrodin@starfish-events.com or visit the Wizards booth onsite.


If you can't make it to either party, don't worry! You can stay on top of everything via Twitter and the #MTGScars hashtag.
