I**gnite the Dawn**

The archangel Avacyn has returned! A bright, fiery dawn banishes Innistrad's shadows. Humanity takes up arms and drives back the creatures of the night. With flights of angels overhead, the righteous band together and wield holy light and miraculous magic to restore the balance of their world. 

*Avacyn Restored* will be on sale in the **Magic Online** store on May 21, but the *Avacyn Restored* prerelease lets you experience the third set in the *Innistrad* block early.
