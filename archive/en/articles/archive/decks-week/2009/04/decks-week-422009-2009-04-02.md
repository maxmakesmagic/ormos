There are just a few weeks left in the Pro Tour Qualifier-Honolulu season, and Top 8 results are streaming in from all over. Despite the fact the season has been in full swing for a few months, new decks are constantly being added to the gauntlet. Astral Slide, Ranger Zoo, Kiki-Jiki combo; the list of brand new decks coming out each week could go on and on. Of course, thanks to Decks of the Week you can find all those deck lists right here. And, if you're looking for a PTQ near you, make sure to check out [the official PTQ schedule](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/honolulu09-qualifiers).


Speaking of Extended, **Magic Online** has played host to multiple Extended Premier Event Top 8s since the last time we met. Make sure to scope out those deck lists for additional deck ideas for your Honolulu PTQs. Of course, there have been a ton of other events online over the past week. Dozens of Standard and *Shards of Alara* Block PEs have successfully resolved, and we've got all the Top 8 decks here. For fans of older formats, we even have some Classic lists too. And don't forget to scope out the Pauper deck lists; see what players used to compete in *that* wacky format.


So many deck lists, so little time. So what are you waiting for? Start reading!
