![9757](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=9757)**[The Ultimate Nightmare of Wizards of the Coast® Customer Service](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=9757)** – *Unglued* uncommon. The phone number in the flavor text of [The Ultimate Nightmare of Wizards of the Coast® Customer Service](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Ultimate+Nightmare+of+Wizards+of+the+Coast%C2%AE+Customer+Service) is no longer accurate. But in the United States and Canada, (800) 324-6496 will work. Outside those countries, use (425) 204-8069 or go to [wizards.custhelp.com](http://wizards.custhelp.com).
 ![Fiery Conclusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fiery+Conclusion)**[Fiery Conclusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Conclusion)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* common. Some monocolored cards in *Ravnica* clearly belong to one guild. Others, like [Fiery Conclusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Conclusion), could belong to more than one. Its flavor text shows how it's viewed by three red-aligned guilds. Apparently Gruul has no time for that sort of thing.
 ![Terminal Moraine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Terminal+Moraine)**[Terminal Moraine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminal+Moraine)** – *Planeshift* uncommon. Before [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) and the extremely similar [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds), there was [Terminal Moraine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminal+Moraine), which made the mistake of trying to provide mana itself.
 ![Last Chance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Last+Chance)**[Last Chance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Chance)** – *Masters Edition* rare. [Last Chance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Chance) is exactly the same as [Final Fortune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Fortune), except that it's a sorcery instead of an instant. This is because it was originally printed in *Portal*, which didn't have any instants.
 ![Final Revels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Final+Revels)**[Final Revels](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Revels)** – *Lorwyn* uncommon. Have you seen the skull hidden in the art of [Final Revels](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Revels)? [This arcana](/en/articles/archive/last-reveler-2010-11-03) will show it to you!
 ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1996_World_Champion.jpg)**1996 World Champion** – One-of-a-kind rare. Although it's not in Gatherer, there is a card named 1996 World Champion. Given away to that year's winner, Tom Chanpheng, it has shroud and power/toughness equal to target opponent's life. And although it costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) to cast, it can be tutored for at instant speed for no mana and a discarded hand.


![Talruum Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Talruum+Champion)**[Talruum Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talruum+Champion)** – *Visions* common. For as long as there's been talk of **Magic** on the Internet, there have been rumors of a "Throat Wolf" card, which is said to have "firstest strike." If such a creature were to exist, it would probably look a lot like [Talruum Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talruum+Champion). Although it doesn't work against creatures with double strike.
 ![Champion Lancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Champion+Lancer)**[Champion Lancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion+Lancer)** – *Masters Edition IV* rare. [Champion Lancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion+Lancer) originally appeared in the beginner-level set *Starter 1999*, but it's going to make a return appearance in *Masters Edition IV* on **Magic Online**. And its wording hasn't changed in all that time!
 ![Worldgorger Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Worldgorger+Dragon)**[Worldgorger Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldgorger+Dragon)** – *Judgment* rare. [Worldgorger Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldgorger+Dragon) is a Nightmare Dragon because, like [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher) and other Nightmares, it takes something away when it enters the battlefield and returns it when it leaves. Not because of the nightmarish combo it presents with [Animate Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead).
 ![Crucible of Worlds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crucible+of+Worlds)**[Crucible of Worlds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+Worlds)** – *Fifth Dawn* rare. [Crucible of Worlds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+Worlds) was designed by the readers of **magicthegathering.com** under the guidance of Mark Rosewater as part of the second [You Make the Card](/en/articles/archive/you-make-card-2-wrap-2003-11-18-0) back in 2003.
 ![Imprison](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Imprison)**[Imprison](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imprison)** – *Legends* rare. As printed, [Imprison](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imprison) has 29 words of rules text. The Oracle version (which uses modern wording and is considered the official version) has 79. Neither version explains the art.
 ![Hoofprints of the Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hoofprints+of+the+Stag)**[Hoofprints of the Stag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hoofprints+of+the+Stag)** – *Lorwyn* rare. Tragically, the creature that [Hoofprints of the Stag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hoofprints+of+the+Stag) puts onto the battlefield is an Elemental, which means it's not supposed to represent [Glimmerpoint Stag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpoint+Stag) or [Great Sable Stag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Sable+Stag). Or [Stag Beetle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stag+Beetle).
 ![Prince of Thralls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Prince+of+Thralls)**[Prince of Thralls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prince+of+Thralls)** – *Shards of Alara* mythic rare. The horns on [Prince of Thralls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prince+of+Thralls) are mimicked in the headdress worn by the [Demon's Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demon%27s+Herald).
