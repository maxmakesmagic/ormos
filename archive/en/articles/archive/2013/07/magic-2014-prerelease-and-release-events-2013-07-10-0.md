Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for the ***Magic** 2014* Release Events Championship, players are not permitted to have more than one of their accounts entered in any single event at one time. Players are not permitted to have any accounts entered in events played by other players for any reason. If a player is discovered to have more than one account playing in any end-of-season championship or championship event before, during, or after the event, Wizards may take action against that player's account (s), up to and including disqualification with no refund of product and/or Event Tickets, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s).


Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the [**Magic Online** User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1358/~/magic-online%3A-user-agreement-and-software-%20license). If you play in **Magic Online** events, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are playing on your own account. We do not recognize excuses, such as "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that the adult has established.


It will be the player's responsibility to make sure that he or she has been properly entered into this event and is able to join it PRIOR to the start of the Championship. If a player is qualified and is unable to join the Championship, he or she will need to contact customer service for assistance.


**For all *Magic 2014* Release Events, Wizards of the Coast may modify, suspend, and/or cancel an event, substitute prizes, or change the costs and/or schedule for an event without notice, at its sole discretion.**


**Note:** All times are Pacific Daylight Time (UTC -7 hours).
