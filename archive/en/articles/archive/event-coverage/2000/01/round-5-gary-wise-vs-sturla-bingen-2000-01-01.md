Loud versus Quiet: Gary Wise, perhaps one of the most easily... audible... players on the Pro Tour, versus the very patient and quiet Sturla Bingen. Gary chose to play first, and started off with an island and a Sleight of Hand, giving a bit of thought to his choices. Sturla played a plains and Ramosian Sergeant to start *his* game, and Gary answered that with a second island. Sturla attacked with the Sergeant and cast Meddling Mage, which met Counterspell by Gary with no hesitation. Gary played a Yavimaya Coast, and Opted at the end of Sturla's turn, then used Gush to get enough mana and cards for a truly vicious Spontaneous Generation. Sturla used Absorb to counter it, then noted after-the-fact, "I should have attacked!" Gary responded, "I will consider that to be a moral victory."


Sturla played a Coastal Tower and chose not to attack, again, and Gary played a second island to go with his Yavimaya Coast, and a Waterfront Bouncer, which Sturla countered via Counterspell. Sturla played another island and used two of his five mana to play Unnatural Selection, while Gary played Static Orb on his turn. At end of turn Sturla searched with his Sergeant, finding a Lieutenant, then untapped two land. Sturla played an Adarkar Wastes and passed the turn, while Gary untapped the rest of his lands and cast Spiketail Hatchling. Sturla untapped more Land and played another Adarkar Wastes, while Gary chose to not attack. At the end of Gary's turn, Sturla fetched Lin-Sivvi, Defiant Hero, and on Gary's next turn he used Gush to find some new cards and replay a land.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/Worlds2001/891.jpg)*Sturla Bingen*Gary cast Opposition, and Sturla tried a Counterspell, but Gary had one as well and Opposition entered play. Sturla merely played a land and ended his turn, at which point Gary tapped Lin-Sivvi. Sturla searched out Rebel Informer, which is a "combo" with Unnatural Selection, and Gary untapped an island and his Spiketail Hatchling. Sturla untapped two lands and attacked with the mighty Rebel Informer, and passed the turn. Gary used the Hatchling to tap a land, and the Hatchling became a Rebel instead. Gary played a five-point Spontaneous Generation and passed the turn; Sturla untapped two lands and passed it right back. When Gary's tokens started tapping lands, they became Legendary, leaving Gary with one token and a Spiketail Hatchling. Sturla asked for a Disenchant but instead got nothing, while Gary maintained his soft lock by using his two untaps per turn to negate Sturla's. Gary then played another Spiketail Hatchling, which tapped a permanent, then the Hatchlings became Legendary, leaving just one on the table.


With Gary having a full complement of land and Sturla tapped out entirely, Sturla again asked for a Disenchant, to which Gary said "No." Sturla changed tact and untapped an island and Lin-Sivvi, so that he could use Brainstorm before shuffling in search of that Disenchant, but this gave Gary a window of opportunity to tap his Static Orb at end of turn, getting back four lands that had been tapped. Gary used Sleight of Hand to dig for Spontaneous Generation, getting six more tokens. Spiketail Hatchling finally got through for an attack, then, knocking Sturla 'down' to 22. With two mana per turn Sturla was a bit locked, and when Gary has the Thwart for Sturla's Disenchant of the Static Orb, Sturla conceded.


Gary Wise - 1 Sturla Bingen - 0

He had to mulligan, saying "How disappointing", then keeps his new hand. Sturla played a plains, without a Sergeant this time, and Gary again opened with an island and Sleight of Hand. Sturla played a second plains and a Defiant Falcon, while Gary played a second island and Waterfront Bouncer. Sturla's Falcon attacked Gary, and Gary's Bouncer attacked right back after Gary used a second Sleight of Hand. Without even a third land to further his position, Sturla attacked with the Falcon again, while Gary used Gush to power a seven-point Spontaneous Generation. Sturla drew and played an island, while Gary used the Bouncer on the Rebel and attacked with 7 1/1's. Sturla used a Brainstorm at end of turn, then played a second island and a Parallax Wave, which Gary stopped via Counterspell. Instead of attempting to stall for the remaining 32:00, Sturla offered the hand in concession.


**Final Result:** Gary Wise - 2 Sturla Bingen - 0
