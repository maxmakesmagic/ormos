Happy Burn Week! This is the week where we celebrate the wonders of fire. Now, some people will use the word "burn" to mean any old form of direct damage, whether it involves [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lightning%2BBolt) or [Comet Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Comet%2BStorm) even [Hornet Sting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Hornet%2BSting). But not here in Arcana. We're only paying attention to cards that show lots and lots of fire! How many of these cards can you identify?
