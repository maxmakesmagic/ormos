The clip above is from the Player's Guide form the *Legions* Fat Pack. If you like the behind-the-scenes information about **Magic** that you get here on MagicTheGathering.com, then you'll love the Fat Pack! Not only do you get a Player's Guide, which includes a full visual spoiler and a bunch of insider info about the set written by R&D, but the Fat Pack also includes a bunch of booster packs, a novel, and a Spindown life counter. Not a bad deal!


*Legions* goes on sale in stores on Monday, February 3.
