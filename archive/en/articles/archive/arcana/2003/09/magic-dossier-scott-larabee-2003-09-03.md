**Name:** Scott Larabee

**Job title and duties:** Organized Play Territory Manager – North America. Responsible for all contracted premier events in North America, including Grand Prix, Prereleases, Pro Tour Qualifiers, Junior Super Series Challenges, State and Provincial Championships, and Regional Championships.

**Age:** 35

**Family:** Wife Deyanira (Dee Dee) Larabee

**Began working at Wizards:** August 1998

**Previous job:** Budget Analyst at University of California - Irvine; Premier **MTG** Tournament Organizer

**How you got your job here:** I was a volunteer on many early Pro Tours and got to know many of the WotC Pro Tour staff. Because of my experience running **Magic** events, I was offered a job as the events coordinator for the Conventions group in 1998. I transferred to my current job in Organized play in 1999.

**Magic accomplishments prior to working here:** Premier **MTG** Tournament Organizer for Los Angeles, San Diego, and Phoenix; one of the first level 3 judges; highest PTQ finish: 10th (December 1996, Las Vegas, NV); external playtester.

**Expansions or projects you've worked on:** External playtester for the *Urza* Block.

**Favorite part of your job:** The people I work with, both in the office and the Tournament Organizers I contract to run events.

**Least favorite part of your job:** Budgets. Blah.

**Thing you've worked on that you're most proud of:** Junior Super Series Challenges. It was the first program that I had to implement from an idea on paper to 250 events actually running all over the U.S. and Canada. 

**Other games you currently enjoy playing:** *Scrabble, Puerto Rico, Ra, Carcassonne, Liar’s Dice, Advanced Civilization, Age of Renaissance*.

**Favorite Magic card:** [fallen angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=fallen%2Bangel) has always been my favorite card. When I first saw the original art, I thought it was awesome. I also like the mechanic and how it relates to the flavor of the card.
