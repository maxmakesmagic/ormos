You might not be able to become a [Dragonlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+[Dragonlord]&type=+[%22Legendary%22]) and rule the skies of Tarkir, but you *can* become a champion who rules at *Dragons of Tarkir*! The *Dragons of Tarkir* Championships are coming up on *Magic Online*.


How do you achieve your status as Champion? When faced with a difficult decision, the folks on Tarkir look to the Dragonlords as role-models. They choose to follow their Dragonlords based on the ideals each Dragon represents: endurance, cunning, ruthlessness, speed, or savagery. Luckily, your choices on the path to becoming a *Dragons of Tarkir* Champion are a bit narrower; do you choose Limited, or Standard?


In the Limited Championship Qualifiers, players will wrestle with the question of how many Dragons they should play in their Sealed decks. Trick question—play them all! Study up and come back for the [*Dragons of Tarkir* Limited Championship Qualifiers](#ltdqualifier) beginning on Wednesday, June 10, 12:30 p.m. Pacific (UTC-7) through Tuesday, June 16, at 9:30 p.m. After that, we transition to the Standard Championship Qualifiers.


Some might say (a Dragonlord might say) that Constructed is more of a celebration than a mere format, an elaborate 60-card dance meant to show off Dragons in their purest form. Perhaps you disagree and wish to bring an unequivocally worse deck (a non-Dragon deck) to the Qualifiers. Please join us for the [*Dragons of Tarkir* Standard Championship Qualifiers](#strdqualifier) starting on Wednesday, June 17, 12:30 p.m. Pacific where you can sign up for a slot in which your deck can be put to task by one containing more Dragons than yours. Standard Qualifiers run every three hours, on the half hour, through Tuesday, June 23, 9:30 p.m. Even if you're not able to win your first time out, participation in any Qualifier Event will net players a full-art promo version of [Scaleguard Sentinels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scaleguard+Sentinels), a glorious card that is, like all things, better with Dragons. Four or five wins in any Qualifier earns you an invitation to the Finals!


[*Dragons of Tarkir* Limited Championship Finals](#ltdfinals) are up first on Saturday, June 20, 8:00 a.m. Pacific. The [*Dragons of Tarkir* Standard Championship Finals](#strdfinals) follow closely behind on Sunday, June 28, 8:00 a.m. Participation in any Finals match will win you a full-art [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) promo, which zaps people who try to touch your Dragons. In addition to big prizes, the first place winners will be heralded across [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online) in an article that contains a play-by-play of their victories, as well as the Championship-winning decklists. If you missed it, check out the *Fate Reforged* Champion announcement [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-fate-reforged-championship-winners-2015-03-23).


Regardless of whether you're pro-Dragon or—somehow—not, good luck on your journey to the *Dragons of Tarkir* Championship!
