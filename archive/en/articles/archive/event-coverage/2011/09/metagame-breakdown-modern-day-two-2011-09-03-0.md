The dust had settled after five rounds of Modern Constructed and three rounds of ***Magic** 2012* Booster Draft. One hundred fifty-one players emerged with at least five wins to make the cut to Day Two. Of these Modern Constructed decks, twelve posted impressive undefeated records. Three Zoo, two Splinter Twin, two Storm, and one each of Affinity, Twelvepost, Pyromancer Ascension, Melira Pod and Death Cloud were guaranteed a spot on Saturday with 5-0 starts.  
 With five more rounds of Modern Constructed still to come, we would soon see which decks would come forth as the ones to beat. The complete Day Two metagame numbers are here for your pleasure.
