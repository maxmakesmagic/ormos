He's rarely without his trademark smug look and knowing smile. Unfortunately for the good guys, his demeanor sits atop a strong Magic talent. A member of Pro Tour powerhouses Team AlphaBetaUnlimited.com, he's demonstrated his abilities time and again.


Today the new sheriff opposite his edgy drifter is Eugene Harvey, a junior member of Team CMU. His game is still relatively unknown, but training with the best has galvanized it. This tournament marks his breakthrough performance. Before the game, I overheard him discussing strategy, and he said that his Dust Bowls would hive Benafel a hard time, as he had only twenty-three land.


Harvey won the flip and went first. His first-turn Birds of Paradise brought out Chimeric Idol on turn-two. Benafel dropped a Port and tried to stem the tide. He was successful, aided by Harvey's stalling on two lands. He dropped to fourteen before he answered Harvey's second Bird with a kicked Thornscape Battlemage.


He quickly threw Harvey onto the express bus to Trouble Junction with Saproling Burst. Harvey's board was two Fires of Yavimaya, the Idol, and a Bird. Benafel drew and said "Isn't that the biggest beating ever?" having found a Brushland to pay the white kicker on a second Thornscape Battlemage. Harvey conceded.


Benafel kept a dangerous hand for game 2. It had two mountains, Urza's Rage, Flametongue Kavu, two Fires of Yavimaya, and Birds of Paradise. Lucky for him Harvey's draw was likewise borderline.


Neither made a play for four turns, but Benafel found Brushland before Harvey drew action. He shook his fist vigorously, shouting "Yes, YES, YES!!!", turning over the Brushland for the gallery to see. Harvey had a Ghitu Fire for his Llanowar Elves, and Benafel mourned their death. He had plans for them, you see.


Benafel replaced them with Birds, but Harvey had Flametongue Kavu at the ready. So did Benafel. Harvey came back with Blastoderm. That put Benafel in the think tank. He eventually chose to make another Birds and Port Harvey, biding his time until his Shivan Wurm would make its presence felt.


Benafel turned on the mind games. "It's a tough decision, you know? Tapping that mountain. It might just lose you the game." Harvey shrugged him off and Dust Bowled his Brushland. Then he roasted his Birds, leaving him without green mana.


Harvey's Blastoderm brought Benafel to seven, and was joined by a friend. Benafel was drawing from the losing end of his deck, and an eleventh hour unkicked Kavu Titan was hardly going to stop Harvey from showing him the fat end of a baseball bat.


Benafel's opening hand in Game 3 was even worse. For mana, it had only a mountain and Port, and it's only nongreen spell was Ghitu Fire. His next hand was much more agreeable: three lands, including green mana, Saproling Burst, Blastoderm and Fires of Yavimaya.


Harvey played the mana-control game, Assaulting Benafel's Birds of Paradise, Bowling away a Karplusan Forest, and tying him up with Rishadan Port. Benafel's offense was that same unkicked Titan. Harvey's draw was passive enough to let him get out a Fires of Yavimaya.


Harvey Bowled Benafel back down to three lands. Benafel responded in kind with a Ghitu Fire on Harvey's Birds, but the gambit was successful. Benafel was reduced to playing his Thornscape Battlemages as Gray Ogres, while Harvey made Blastoderms and Flametongue Kavus.


With things looking grim in the actual game, Benafel tried to shake Harvey's confidence, reminding him that he was up two games to one in his semifinal match, and that didn't seem to help him. Harvey took some small comfort in beating Benafel next turn.

A hand of six green cards and a Port is suicide no matter how you look at it. His six card hand was a step up, but still only had two lands in it. Harvey scowled at his hand, but it was apparently good enough to keep.


Benafel's only play for the first four turns was an unkicked Titan that got Assaulted. He was able to keep Harvey off Red mana with his Port, but failed to draw any lands. The Dust Bowl came down to take away his Port, and only then did he draw Karplusan Forest. He made a Bird.


He dared Harvey to take away his Karplusan, and Harvey obliged. Benafel made a Llanowar Elf and passed the turn. Harvey removed the Bird with Ghitu Fire and cast a Blastoderm. Benafel slumped in his chair and sighed heavily. He played another Ogre Battlemage while Harvey burned away his Llanowar Elf and made a Shivan Wurm.


On his last turn, Benafel attacked with his Battlemage and Harvey blocked with his Wurm. Benafel's only remark was "I thought you might.", and he extended the hand.


Harvey's next obstacle is David Bachmann, whom he beat in the quarterfinals, for a spot on the national team.


**Final Result:** Eugene Harvey defeats Chris Benafel 3-1
