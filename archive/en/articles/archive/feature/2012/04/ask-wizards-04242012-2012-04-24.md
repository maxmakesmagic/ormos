Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to AskWizards@wizards.com. We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks! Additionally you can ask questions via twitter using the [#askwizards](https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23askwizards) hashtag. We'll watch that hashtag and pull the best questions to be answered!

**Q:** Is the [Helvault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helvault) replacing the Silverspear promo for those events?


- Marcus


**A:** From **Paul Levy**, Brand Manager for **Magic**


No! The promo is being given out for every prerelease (while supplies last of course) but it is in addition to those events which will open the [Helvault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helvault). So if you are registered (you did check about preregistering didn't you?) for your store's [Helvault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helvault) event, you're all set to get the Moonsilver Spear promo AND get what is inside the [Helvault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helvault).

**Q:** I've just returned to the game after a few years and I've noticed that now basic lands are now being printed in the first and third set of a block (In addition to the core-set now released annually too). What was the reason for the extra land printing?


- John


**A:** From **Trick Jarrett**, editor of **DailyMTG.com**


Hi John and welcome back to **Magic**! What you're noticing isn't that we now put new lands in the third sets of a block, instead you're noticing that rather than Blocks being *Large – Small – Small* we've taken to mucking around with their sizes. Such as Innistrad where the sets were *Large – Small – Large* or the Zendikar block which was also *Large – Small – Large*. We run new lands for Large sets, and the Small set booster packs include a basic land from the preceding Large set.


Hope that clears it up for you! Thanks for your question.


  
Yesterday we held a Q&A sessions with Mark Rosewater and Dave Humpherys to talk about Avacyn Restored. This question was asked during that session.

**Q:** The Miracle mechanic is very interesting, and makes a lot of sense for what it does. I imagine it was a tough one to implement, though; were there any attempts that didn't quite make it before you settled on the current design?


- Geo R.


**A:** From **Dave Humpherys**, Lead Developer for *Avacyn Restored*


When development first received Miracles it was still an open question of exactly how they should be implemented in terms of their effects. For example, it wasn't clear if there should be some additional affect when you drew the card.


We had many designs that let you do something when you drew the card but the actual cost to play the card was unchanged. While this worked out in practice it reduced the number of possible turn in which you could often make the most of your miracle since you needed more mana (other than the smaller triggered effect when you drew it).


When we were polling these cards around the building we gathered feedback from half the people on cards that looked that way and have where the cost was reduced as you now see today.


The cards that were the implementation we went forward with fared much better (they were more popular) I believe in large part because they were more straightforward and easy to appreciate the power of.
