*What's your favorite new card in **Magic** 2012, and why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kennagle.jpg)**Ken Nagle:** My favorite new card in ***Magic** 2012* is [Primordial Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primordial+Hydra). As a fan of green, fatties, and Hydras in general ([Hydra Omnivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydra+Omnivore) being my second newest addition), when I was on the M12 design team I was looking for an upgrade to the flavorful but tame [Protean Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hydra) from core sets past. I was not going to let this opportunity slip!

The trample ability proved too over-the-top in our Future Future League, so it was scaled back to a "semi-trample" ability suggested by Mark Gottlieb. Upon hitting 8/8 it was weaker, but still lethal a turn later.

While we want **Magic** cards to be flavorful in the [Protean Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hydra) vein, we also need iconic fantasy creature types to be powerful enough that players choose to play with them regularly. It gives **Magic** the key fantasy feel that entices passersby looking on to stop and check it out.
