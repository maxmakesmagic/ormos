Today I would like to talk about playing favorites.

I don't know if my favorite set of all time is really *Visions*, but I always say that it is. *Visions* was printed at a pivotal time—lucky thirteen years ago—in my development as a player and deck designer. *Visions* lacked both the linear-driven power we would some years later associate with [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager), [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), or [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique), and the raw power that had, at that point, not been so far off ([Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) and [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus+) were just three to four years removed, [Channel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel+) had been legal in Standard two years earlier, and [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) was about fifteen seconds out the door). Heck, they still let you play with four copies of [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence)\* in "Type II."

\* Yet barely anyone played it at that point.

What the typical *Visions* Constructed-playable card represented, at least in my memory, was a good card with a good effect (not "broken" but just very good) ... at a reasonable cost.
