| **Kai Budde** (Germany): Raphael Levy | **Scott Wills** (UK): Noah Boeken or Raphael Levy | **Bram Snepvangers** (Netherlands): Joost or Noah |

### Question Seven: How can you explain why no UK players made the top 8 at this year's Euro Championship?




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Ben Ronaldson**  (England): Lots of us did well on the draft day, but those people didn't do well enough on the Standard day. A lot of us are bunched around 30th place. | **Tony Dobson** (England): We suck. | **Mark Wraith** (England): We didn't do much testing of Standard and the testing we did do was completely ignored by everyone who just played the crappy decks. |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

### Question Four: What do you think will be the most common deck played tomorrow?




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Nicolai Herzog** (Norway) - "Angry Hermit. It is stable and has a fair shot at beating most decks." | **Bram Snepvangers** (Netherlands) - "Angry Hermit. It only loses to Bargain and Wildfire, and they aren't very common." | **Michael Debard** (France) - "Stompy. Many players like it, it is a fair deck that is capable of winning most matchups." |

| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Ollie Schneider** (UK) - "John Ormerod. I just can't beat him." | **Noah Boeken** (Netherlands) - "Franck Canu. I am 3-0 and he is 0-3, so if I have to play him then things are not going well for me" | **Raphael Levy** (France) - "Anyone in type 2 rounds who manages to build a good original deck" |
