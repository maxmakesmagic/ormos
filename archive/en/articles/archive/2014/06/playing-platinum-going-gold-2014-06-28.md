After this weekend, people will only be able to play in two more events in the 2013–2014 Professional Point Season. There's the big showdown at Pro Tour *Magic* 2015 in Portland, Oregon, of course, and two simultaneous Grand Prix in Boston-Worcester and Taipei the weekend before. So the race for points is well on its homestretch, for all the various goals of reaching levels in the Pro Players Club, positioning oneself as one's country's team captain for the World *Magic* Cup, and earning a coveted invite to the World Championship.


And this year for the first time, the math is even more complicated than usual, as just the best five Grand Prix finishes count toward a player's point total. For example, Jérémy Dezani, ranked No. 2 in the Top 25 rankings, already made second place at a Grand Prix this season (worth six points), ended up twice in the Top 4 (five points each), racked up another Top 8 (four points), and finished seventh with his team at the GP in Barcelona (three points). So, to get further points here at this Grand Prix at all, Dezani would need another Top 8! Not to worry, though, his finishes so far put him at a combined score of 23 Pro Points from Grand Prix alone, with his 43 points from the three past Pro Tours making that a whopping 66. Of course, thanks to his win at Pro Tour *Theros*, Dezani has already made it to Platinum a long time ago and is already qualified for the World Championship as well.


For others, the road to one of the levels in the Pro Players Club is considerably more stony. Players need 45 points for Platinum, 35 for Gold. Once someone has reached Gold, that person is qualified for all Pro Tours of the current and following season, and every Pro Tour puts a guaranteed three points into a player's account. So most—but not all—of the people in the list below can add an as-of-now imaginary three points to their total. Still, they are in attendance here at Grand Prix Milan with the express purpose of getting more points:
