Previews for the ***Magic** 2011* core set are still happening. As you no doubt know, you can already find lots of cards, both new and reprinted, in the [Visual Spoiler](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/magic2011/spoiler) on the [M11 mini-site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/products.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/products/magic2011). But what about the cards yet to be previewed? What about the cards that are appearing *right now* on other websites than this one?

Well, that's where we come in! We can't guarantee exactly when these cards will appear, but we know they'll probably show up right about when you see this. So, just like last week, here are the card names of the exclusive previews that should be going up tonight. We can't tell you what they do yet—that would be what "exclusive" means!—but you can follow the links below to find out. Oh, and for some of these it might help to speak French. And Italian. And Japanese. Good luck!
