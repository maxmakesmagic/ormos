The [***Magic** 2011* Visual Spoiler](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/magic2011/spoiler) is full to bursting with cards! So what we're going to do today is pull out five of them so that you can look at them without the rest of the set around. Because what better way to appreciate a cycle?


The art descriptions for the five titans put it best: Note that some giants in fantasy are like stupid, drooling, oversized brutes. This Titan is the OTHER kind of giant: the seldom-seen, almost godlike giants of legend. They're shrewd, majestic, and incredibly powerful.


### Sun Titan

**Art Description:**



> This titan represents the power of the sun. He's huge (about 25 ft/8m tall), muscular, and armed with shining armor and a greatsword. His eyes glow so brightly with 'sunlight' that his face is mostly obscurred...no one will ever face him eye to eye-- a breathtaking and terrible sight for tiny mortals.

### Frost Titan

**Art Description:**



> This titan represents the power of ice and frost. He's huge (about 25 ft/8m tall), with ice-blue muscular physique, and armed with an axe of ice -- a breathtaking and terrible sight for tiny mortals. from his mouth eminates a constant sheet of heavy frost, like a breath of steam from heavy dry ice. He looks down on us, coldly condescending.

**Art Description:**



> This titan represents the power of death and darkness. He's huge (about 25 ft/8m tall), muscular, and armed with black plate armor (though its open around his ribs and stomach) and a jagged scythe, ornamented with dangling human and not-so-human skulls -- a breathtaking and terrible sight for tiny mortals. His chest cavity is stuffed with various corpses, that slowly fall from his exposed rib cage as he moves.. and army of undead that fall from him.

He's huge (about 25 ft/8m tall), with red-tinted skin, a fiery beard, and armed with a huge fiery flail -- a breathtaking and terrible sight for tiny mortals.

**Art Description:**



> This titan represents the fury of Mother Nature. He's huge (about 25 ft/8m tall), muscular, fully-bearded (maybe ivy grows in his beard), dressed in natural armor (perhaps fur, leather, and vines), and armed with a huge wooden hammer or tree-cudgel, and in the other hand carries a sling of some sort loaded with a stone. greenish mist accompanies his presence -- a breathtaking and terrible sight for tiny mortals. Show him shouting or shaking a mighty fist in rage, or otherwise summoning up a great power of natural fury.
