So we're down to the final match. Martin Dang has eschewed the Khan's wedge structure to go with a nice [Grixis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grixis) deck. Nikolas Labahn is running Abzan colors, but his deck has a Temur-y bear theme with 3 [Alpine Grizzly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpine+Grizzly) and 3 [Savage Punch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Punch).

Game 1 saw a very strong draw from Dang. He curved out with [Jeskai Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Sage), a morph and then [Orc Sureshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orc+Sureshot). The Sureshot hit the mark the next turn as Dang was able to cast both a [Jeskai Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Sage) and another morph in the same turn to remove Labahn's Grizzly. This left Labahn facing down five creatures with just a solitary [Alpine Grizzly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpine+Grizzly) for company. That wasn't enough and that was the end of a very quick first game.


**Dang 1-0 Labahn**


Sometimes final matches are epic battles. Other times they're damp squibs as one player's deck malfunctions badly. Sadly for Labahn, already a game down, his deck chose an unfortunate time to be miserly on lands.

He missed his third land drop with a rueful shake of his head. That handed the initiative to Dang and meant he already had a [Jeskai Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Sage) and morph on the table by the time Labahn summoned a morph of his own. Dang followed with a steady stream of morphs. One of those turned out to be a [Glacial Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Stalker), which was bigger than the poor [Frontier Mastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frontier+Mastodon) that found itself in the way of it. Labahn continued to ruefully shake his head as his deck refused to cough up a fourth land.


**Martin Dang defeats Nikolas Labahn 2-0**


Not a classic, but I doubt Martin Dang will complain as he now gets to go home with a nice trophy and a big check as the champion of Grand Prix Liverpool 2015!
