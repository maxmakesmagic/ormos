![Balthor the Defiled](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Balthor+the+Defiled)**[Balthor the Defiled](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balthor+the+Defiled)** – *Judgment* rare. Originally, [Balthor the Stout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balthor+the+Stout) was [Kamahl, Pit Fighter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kamahl%252C%2BPit%2BFighter)'s mentor, a leader of men (and dwarves) in the Pardic Mountains. But Balthor was killed while battling [Ambassador Laquatus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ambassador%2BLaquatus) and was reanimated as [Balthor the Defiled](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balthor+the+Defiled). Balthor's second death comes at Kamahl's hands, who goes on to slay Laquatus himself.
 ![Mirri the Cursed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mirri+the+Cursed)**[Mirri the Cursed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirri+the+Cursed)** – *Planar Chaos* rare. In one of the alternate-reality storylines hinted at on *Planar Chaos* cards, [Mirri, Cat Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mirri%252C%2BCat%2BWarrior) succumbed to the vampiric curse that afflicted [Crovax the Cursed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crovax%2Bthe%2BCursed) in the original *Weatherlight* saga. The original outcome is depicted on [Curiosity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Curiosity), and the twisted, alternate outcome is shown on [Keen Sense](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keen+Sense). 
 ![Pentavus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pentavus)**[Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus)**—*Mirrodin* rare. The [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus) is a larger version of [Tetravus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tetravus) (from *Antiquities*). It was originally a Hexavus, but it had to be shrunk in development.
 ![Sarcomite Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sarcomite+Myr)**[Sarcomite Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomite+Myr)**—*Future Sight* common. Myrs are ordinarily described with a metal ([Iron Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr), etc.), but "Sarcomite" conveys something altogether different. The "sarco-" prefix means "flesh" or "muscle", so you've got a Myr (magic artificial creature) that's been made from meat, not metal. Creepy!
 ![Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Exalted+Angel)**[Exalted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel)**—*Onslaught* rare. [Exalted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) was so good in *Onslaught* Block limited that you didn't even need to have the card for it to strike fear into an opponent's heart. Every face-down morph creature could potentially be a lifelinked 4/5 flier attacking on the fourth turn. Scary!
 ![Devouring Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Devouring+Light)**[Devouring Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Light)**—*Ravnica: City of Guilds* uncommon. The *Ravnica* keyword "Convoke" had a more direct, but less flavorful, name in development: crittercast.
 ![Unearth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Unearth)**[Unearth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unearth)**—*Urza's Legacy* common. Someday, someone will ask you "What is the only card not in *Shards of Alara* with two of that set's keywords on it?" This is going to be the card they're thinking of.
 ![Meddling Kids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Meddling+Kids)**[Meddling Kids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Kids)**—*Unhinged* rare. Obviously a reference to [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), the kids share the blue-white nature of the mage. Note how each of them has one blue arm (the left) and one white arm (the right).
 ![Krazy Kow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Krazy+Kow)**[Krazy Kow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krazy+Kow)**—*Unglued* common. [Krazy Kow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krazy+Kow) was originally a reference to Mad Cow Disease, but got changed somewhere along the way due to concerns about sensitivity. So now it's a reference to Krazy Kat!
 ![Pit Scorpion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pit+Scorpion)**[Pit Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Scorpion)**—*Legends* common. Of the three scorpions in **Magic**, only [Pit Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Scorpion) uses poison counters. It was also one of the two cards (along with [Serpent Generator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serpent+Generator)) that introduced poison to the game, back in *Legends*.
 ![Grand Melee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grand+Melee)**[Grand Melee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Melee)**—*Onslaught* rare. In the art for [Grand Melee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Melee), Kamahl goes up against a cleric in the pits. Thanks to the effects of the spell, the cleric shares the barbarian's rage.
 ![Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Flash)**[Flash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash)**—*Mirage* rare. Originally, [Flash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash) was kept in check by the clause that buried the creature if the player couldn't pay for it. Later cards with benefits based on *leaving* play as well as coming into play turned that into an advantage!
 ![Order of the White Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Order+of+the+White+Shield)*Masters Edition 2* uncommon. Under the leadership of Lucilde Fiksdotter, the Order of the White Shield's goal was to hunt down and kill the nefarious Lim-Dûl.

![Orcish Lumberjack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Orcish+Lumberjack)*Masters Edition 2* common. [Orcish Lumberjack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Lumberjack) inspired a number of other "lumberjacks", including [Goblin Clearcutter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Clearcutter) (from *Legions*) and most recently *Shadowmoor*'s [Valleymaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valleymaker).  
[*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)
![Infernal Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Infernal+Darkness)*Masters Edition 2* rare. Look closely at the art for [Infernal Darkness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Darkness). See the tiny mountains in the foreground? That's actually an *enormous* demon blotting out the sun itself!  
[*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)
![Gorilla Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gorilla+Shaman)*Masters Edition 2* uncommon. Affectionately nicknamed "Mox Monkey", the Gorilla Shaman was best known for feasting on the zero-cost artifacts that tended to fill up Vintage games.  
[*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)
![Ravages of War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ravages+of+War)*Masters Edition 2* rare. After being reprinted in *Portal* and *Portal Second Age*, [Armageddon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) was given a Historical Chinese twist to appear in *Portal Three Kingdoms*.  
[*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)
![Night Soil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Night+Soil)*Masters Edition 2* uncommon. At 1999 Pro Tour–Rome, while everyone else was playing powerful combos based on [Tolarian Academy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Academy), [Fluctuator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator), [High Tide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide), and [Lion's Eye Diamond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond), Alan Comer brought a deck that ran four [Enlightened Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor)s and a large stack of powerful-but-specific enchantments like [Night Soil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Soil).  
[*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)
![Bounty of the Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bounty+of+the+Hunt)*Masters Edition 2* rare. Thanks to a quirk in the targeting rules, [Bounty of the Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bounty+of+the+Hunt) originally used +1/+1 counters that got removed at the end of the turn. These days, it just gives creatures +1/+1 "until end of turn".  
[*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)
![Thermokarst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thermokarst)*Masters Edition 2* common. [Thermokarst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermokarst) was a key card in "Legion Land Loss", an Extended deck that relied on monogreen land destruction, fast mana, and (in common with many other decks of the time), [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore).  
[*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)
![Jester's Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jester%27s+Mask)*Masters Edition 2* rare. [Jester's Mask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jester%27s+Mask) and [Jester's Cap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jester%27s+Cap) were the first two cards to let a player look through an opponent's deck. This "jester" ability later made it onto many more cards.  
[*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)
![Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swords+to+Plowshares)*Masters Edition 2* uncommon. While the original art for [Swords to Plowshares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) just showed a man in a field (presumably he had turned his sword into a plowshare already), the *Ice Age* art showed a sword in the act of being transformed.
