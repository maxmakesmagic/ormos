*Future Sight* previews have finally come to **magicthegathering.com**. But if that hasn't sated your appetite for previews, you're in luck. Today being Wednesday, [the minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/futuresight/home) has faithfully updated with new *Future Sight*-riffic content.


This week's content includes:


* An article discussing the ins and outs of a seemingly innocuous, yet deeply strange, *Future Sight* card by Laurie Cheers,
* Exclusive *Future Sight* card art,
* Further insights into the flavor themes of *Future Sight*, and
* An online jigsaw puzzle featuring *Future Sight* desktop wallpaper.

We tried to think of reasons why you might want *not* to check it out. We thought for days and came to the conclusion that there truly are none. Logically, your only recourse is to, indeed, [check it out](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/futuresight/home). Q.E.D.
