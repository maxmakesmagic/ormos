As a [Fool's Tome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Fool%2527s%2BTome), a [Bayou Dragonfly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Bayou%2BDragonfly), a [Squee's Toy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Squee%2527s%2BToy), and arguably [Medicine Bag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Medicine%2BBag) that ever served aboard a skyship, Squee is an irrepressible character of **Magic** continuity.


As [Squee, Goblin Nabob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squee%2C+Goblin+Nabob) is reprinted in *Tenth Edition*, he's getting back in the limelight for his "immortality" mechanic. But he had quite a history in the storyline before becoming so famously hard to kill.

Squee's political career was launched when he encountered the Kyren, a species of intelligent and unusually politically-minded goblins in Mercadia. They made Squee a general, and outfitted him with [General's Regalia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=General%27s+Regalia).

[Snuff Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snuff+Out) depicts Squee in the very same regalia. This shows him after he has exposed the Kyren's plans to aid the Phyrexians. Note the Phyrexian skyships exploding in the background.

[Crumbling Sanctuary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Sanctuary) depicts Squee, again in his general's outfit, cowering in an alcove as the building crumbles around him.

[Phyrexian Tyranny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Tyranny) depicts Crovax, on his throne evincar of Rath, with Squee's broken body before him. Since Squee keeps coming back to life, the cursed Crovax keeps killing his former crewmate over and over for his own amusement.
