After a week off while Brian David-Marshall and our Pro Tour writers took the stage, I'm back with some news on what you should be tuning in for this weekend, along with some updates on who deserves celebration for their successes in March and April.


*Magic Online* Championship
===========================


Some of the very best *Magic Online* players are traveling to Seattle, Washington, this week to compete in a three-day tournament featuring four different formats. Those players are vying for their share of a prize purse totaling more than $100,000, and we'll be broadcasting the whole thing to you live! It's the *Magic Online* Championship, and it features the very best *Magic Online* competitors in a bout for a seat at the 2016 World Championship and the $25,000 check that comes with a win.


Here are some quick details on this event:


*Editor's Note: The structure for Sunday's playoff matches that was initially published had differences from what was communicated to the competitors. The playoff match structure has been amended to reflect what was messaged to the competitors.*


* The *Magic Online* Championship is a three-day tournament featuring three rounds of Legacy and four rounds of Standard on Friday, and then three rounds of *Shadows over Innistrad* Booster Draft and four rounds of Modern on Saturday before a cut to the Top 4 playoffs.
* Sunday features best-two-out-of-three *matches*, where the top-seeded player chooses one of the three Constructed formats featured during the weekend (Standard, Modern, or Legacy) for the first match. Then, the person who did *not*choose the format for the first match chooses the format for the second match. Should the match score be equal after two matches, the third and final match will use the last remaining format.
* The winner of the *Magic Online* Championship receives a $25,000 first-place prize, Platinum status in the Pro Tour Players Club for the remainder of the 2015–16 season and the entirety of the 2016–17 Premier Play season, and an invitation to compete in the 2016 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship later this year.

Looking to tune in to live coverage? I can help you with that.


* The live video broadcast of the *Magic Online* Championship starts at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET/6 p.m. UTC all three days on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic), and will feature commentary from Limited Resources podcast hosts [Marshall Sutcliffe](https://twitter.com/marshall_lr) and [Luis Scott-Vargas](https://www.twitch.tv/lsv), along with Pro Tour historian [Brian David-Marshall](https://twitter.com/top8games) and full-time Twitch streamer [Kenji Egashira](https://www.twitch.tv/numotthenummy). Working behind the scenes is coverage manager Rich Hagon, tech producer Rashad Miller, and tech crew Garth Avery. Nate Price will be representing the community team, and he'll be plugging away at content you can find on our official [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic) pages. I'll be there as well, bringing you decklists, overviews of each format's results, and of course, an end-of-weekend recap along with an interview with the winner.
* The *Magic Online* Championship coverage page will be your home for pairings, results, standings, decklists, and articles. Check back regularly to see what competitors are playing and more!
* Decklists for each format will become available after the first round of play of each format concludes. This means that Legacy decklists will be available after Round 1, Standard decklists will be available after Round 4, and Modern decklists will be available after Round 11.

Anything else you should be aware of? Well, yes!


On Friday, digital product manager Lee Sharpe will be bringing you an announcement after Round 3 is completed about some sweet Legacy stuff to look forward to on *Magic Online* this summer!


Looking to read about this year's competitors? David Whitfield compiled [an article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/meet-magic-online-championship-competitors-2016-05-11) with each player's profile yesterday on this very website, so I recommend checking that out if you haven't seen who's competing this weekend.


Who will be crowned this year's *Magic Online* Champion? Tune in to [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) starting Friday at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET/6 p.m. UTC to find out!


Player of the Month (#MTGPOM) for March and April
=================================================


Following all of the excitement of *Shadows over Innistrad*'s release, and the Grand Prix and Pro Tours that followed, Player of the Month has lagged behind for a bit. Today, we crown March and April's winners of the Player of the Month title.


First up is Ralph Betesh, who has earned March's honors by being the player who achieved victory against the Eldrazi menace of Modern in one of the rare weekends where nearly everyone was rooting for Abzan Company to take the win.

April's Player of the Month is none other than Steve Rubin, [Pro Tour *Shadow over Innistrad* Champion](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi). We look forward to seeing Steve return to the World Championship later this year!

We will return to your regularly scheduled Player of the Month voting during the first week of June, as we look back at the month of May to crown a new Player of the Month then.
