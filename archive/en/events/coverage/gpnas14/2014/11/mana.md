 Throughout premier play with *Khans of Tarkir* one story rises every time: Mana really matters. In Sealed, the ability to play your most powerful cards without sacrificing consistency ensures a potent deck. In Draft, the ability to play spells as early and often as possible is a powerful tool alongside the choice to play as many dual lands as possible – reaching four or five different colors of mana and the strongest cards picked along the way.
