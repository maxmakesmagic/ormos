We're going to be trying something a little different this month compared to previous Friday Night *Magic* promo updates. So if you're used to our old format, I'd avoid simply scrolling to the bottom to get the next new card. Because today you're going to be seeing three new upcoming cards.


Here's what we're going to be trying out. We're going to try releasing three Friday Night *Magic* promos at a time, as we currently batch three of them together in a "season" of sorts. For example, the three new cards I'm going to show you today are all cards from *Kaladesh*, while the previous three were from *Eldritch Moon*.


Let's start off by looking at that previous batch, as they're all still relevant.


**January**

**February**

**March**

That means that for what's left of January (this week), you can get a promo [Noose Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noose+Constrictor) at your local Friday Night *Magic*. In February, that changes to [Fortune's Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortune%27s+Favor). In March, [Incendiary Flow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incendiary+Flow). Each of these cards is unique to Friday Night *Magic*.


The next batch will all be cards from *Kaladesh*. Let's take a look.


**April**


With [Sram's Expertise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sram%27s+Expertise) getting a lot of attention, will [Servo Exhibition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servo+Exhibition) make the leap to Standard? Time will tell, but if it does, this promo version with [Vincent Proce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Vincent+Proce%22%5d)'s new art sure will look good alongside whatever expertise Sram has going for him.

**May**


I would stand back, but I really do want to get my hands on one of these premium versions of a premium removal spell. [Unlicensed Disintegration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration) is certainly the most powerful removal spell in Standard, and this new art from [Florian de Gesincourt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Florian+de+Gesincourt%22%5d) is powerfully great.

**June**


This might just be the most-played card in Standard, and [Jonas De Ro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Jonas+De+Ro%22%5d)'s version of the card is certainly worthy of that title. Players will want to pick up a number of these come June, and I have a feeling that number is four.

Stay tuned to DailyMTG near the start of every month, as we'll find a way to remind you what Friday Night *Magic* Promo will be available that month. But in the meantime, here are three months to look forward to.
