**What card should more people be playing in their Sideboard?**



Sideboard slots are a precious resource. They are also an underappreciated one. They affect the majority of your games, and are often the highest impact cards. I asked some of Day 2’s best which sideboard cards aren’t getting the respect they deserve.

I always want that card. It’s a one-mana removal spell that also does extra damage. Being able to play two spells in a turn is huge.

Jon Stern, 2-Time GP Champ** – [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). Specifically I think it shouldn’t be in main because it’s so weak against control, but you want it against all flavors of Abzan.

Brad Nelson, Lord of Standard** – The thing is, Magic is cyclical. Up until this weekend I would’ve said [Glare of Heresy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Heresy), but right now it’s [Self-Inflicted Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Self-Inflicted+Wound). In a couple weeks it will be something else.
