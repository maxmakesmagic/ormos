Will Jund continue to dominate Standard? Will [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) be the Planeswalker of choice, or will [Ajani Vengeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant+)  hold sway?

* [**Saturday: Meet the Commentators**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/10sandiego/sd3.mp3) (15.3 MB)
Saturday sees the debut of a new webcast pairing – Pro Tour Statistician Rich Hagon joins Pro Tour Historian Brian David-Marshall to call home the first champion of the 2010 Pro Tour season. But how did they get the best seat in the house? The tables are turned as the resident interviewers become interviewees, and you get a chance to meet the team who will be sharing all the fun and excitement of the live webcast this season.

Round 14 here at Pro Tour-San Diego, and two massive matches take center stage in the arena. Luis Scott-Vargas began Pro Tou-Kyoto a year ago 11-0, before falling to England's Matteo Orsini-Jones. Now he stands at an even more remarkable 13-0, and once again a Brit stands in his way, and this time it's National Champion Dan Gardner. Can he stop the LSV machine? On the other table – and it's amazing that this really is the "other" table – Gabriel Nassif and Katsuhiro Mori go head to head, trying to stay alive at X-4. All the action, as it happens.
