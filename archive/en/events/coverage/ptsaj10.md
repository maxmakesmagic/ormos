Paulo Celebrates Six on the Beach in San Juan

Pro Tour San Juan 2010
----------------------


*[日本語の記事へ](http://mtg-jp.com/eventc/ptsanjuan/)* 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptsj10/banner_sun.jpg)In just 23 career Pro Tours, Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa had made the Sunday stage an astonishing six times—a feat equaled by only six other players in the history of the game. However, Pro Tour victory had eluded him until this weekend at Pro Tour–San Juan. Centering his black-green draft deck around timely removal, versatile Eldrazi Spawn, and [Nirkana Revenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nirkana+Revenant) , Damo da Rosa overcame Guillaume Matignon's blue-black Level up deck to secure the championship and the $40,000 first prize.


No player had ever won a Pro Tour losing the first match of the weekend … until now. Damo da Rosa fought back from an 0-2 start on Friday to make Sunday's Top 8 and then defeated Matignon 3-2 in the *Rise of the Eldrazi* Booster Draft finals to capture a long sought-after Pro Tour title. At just 22 years old, Paulo is demonstrating a mastery of **Magic** rarely seen...how many more Top 8s are in store for the Brazilian superstar?


Congratulations to Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, your Pro Tour–San Juan champion!
