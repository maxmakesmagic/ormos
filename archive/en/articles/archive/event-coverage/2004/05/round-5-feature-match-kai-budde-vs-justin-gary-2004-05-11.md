This match pits two of the all-time greats against one another, playing decks that, well, let's just say that "all-time greats" is not a good choice of descriptions for them. Gary was packing the five-color John Avon special that usually wins via attrition (either [Millstone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millstone) or [Legacy Weapon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legacy+Weapon)). Kai was stuck with the Glen Angus deck, which was basically four [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger)s and a bunch of tenuous combos that revolve around changing creatures' colors. Kai started with a mulligan, evening out the players' starting hand size. His six-card hand was also bad, but he had to keep it. "I parised a hand with [Collapsing Borders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collapsing+Borders) into another one," he moaned, "How lucky."


Budde stumbled on land, but eventually brought out a [Tidal Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidal+Visionary) to deliver vicious one-point beats. Justin simply played [Explosive Vegetation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Vegetation), getting the full domain, then dropped [Legacy Weapon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legacy+Weapon). Kai, holding a grip of unplayable cards, conceded immediately.

Kai looked like he was going to be land-flooded in game 2, but he kept drawing and playing creatures: two Tidal Visionaries, two [Ancient Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Kavu), and a [Metathran Transport](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metathran+Transport). Justin was holding his own quite well, using [Tangle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle) to save himself a bunch of damage, then [Pyrotechnics](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrotechnics) to kill a Visionary and a Kavu, then another [Tangle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle), a [Wall of Air](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Air), and a [Tower of Eons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+of+Eons), which he activated several times to gain 10 life!


Justin was short on white mana, so he didn't play out the [Legacy Weapon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legacy+Weapon) he was holding just yet. Kai used [Sever Soul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sever+Soul) to kill the Wall, and played a [Tsabo's Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo%27s+Assassin) and another [Ancient Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Kavu). Justin drew another [Explosive Vegetation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Vegetation), found his missing color (eliciting another "How lucky" from Kai), and then started going to town again.


Pyrotechincs the Kavu and the Assassin. Gain 10. Gain 10 more. [Legacy Weapon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legacy+Weapon) the Visionary. Kai was drawing nothing but land, and would eventually fall to the big [Apocalypse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Apocalypse) artifact removing everything he had from play.


Gary 2 - Budde 0


Justin had said going into the Auction that he felt people would underestimate the Avon [Legacy Weapon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legacy+Weapon) deck and that he hoped to get it. It came at a reasonable price - 6 cards, 16 life - and is working well for him so far. Kai, on the other hand, wouldn't commit to any deck and was stuck with the dregs. He's 0-2 with it so far, and I expect him to go 0-3.
