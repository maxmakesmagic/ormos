As promised, here's a brief run-through on some of the biggest decks in the tournament, with special attention paid to the decks mentioned in the previous metagame breakdown. There are about a dozen other major players in the format, but these are the biggest decks for this event that might be misunderstood by the uninitiated.


**Omni-Tell** – Almost always mono-blue, Omni-Tell centers around having [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) or [Dream Halls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Halls) slip an [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) into play. Once in play, the powerful enchantment allows the pilot to cycle through the deck using cards like [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), culminating with [Enter the Infinite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enter+the+Infinite) or just the shortcut to [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn). In a pinch, [Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+193452) can substitute for [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience), riding [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) into play.

**High Tide** – Another mono-blue deck, [High Tide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide) centers around its eponymous instant, the mana-generating engine [High Tide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide). Once the first [High Tide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide) has resolved, cards like [Turnabout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turnabout) and [Candelabra of Tawnos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Candelabra+of+Tawnos) to amplify the mana generated, culminating with one massive [Blue Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blue+Sun%27s+Zenith) to finish things off.


**Punishing "X"** – The Punishing tag is associated with versions of typical archetypes featuring the [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire)/[Grove of the Burnwillows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows) engine. This can be found in traditional midrange decks like Jund and Naya, all the way to more controlling decks like [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam)-based decks. This engine gives the decks a long-term, crushing inevitability, as well as some up-front protection from all of the aggro decks in the field.


**Maverick** – One of the less descriptive names in Legacy, Maverick and its variants are essentially GW-based creature decks, relying on the central [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) engine and the versatility of a [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) toolbox to present an incredibly resilient front. Capable of defeating creature decks thanks to [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), combo decks with [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg), and Reanimator strategies with [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze), Maverick has an answer to everything, and threats to end the game quickly.


**Pox** – [Pox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pox) decks utilize a resource denial strategy, relying on the unholy trinity of hand destruction, land destruction, and man destruction to ensure that opponents can't do anything, much less win a game of *Magic*. Cards like [Smallpox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox), (big) [Pox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pox), [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood), [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach), and [Sinkhole](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinkhole) keep opponents under lockdown, while [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast), and eventually [Tombstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tombstalker), finish them off.

**12 Post** – So many posts! 12 Post is the Legacy version of Modern's Tron decks, a big mana deck that does big mana things. Between [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost), [Glimmerpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpost), and [Vesuva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva), this deck is capable of spewing out an unreasonable amount of mana, especially when aided by [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) and [Candelabra of Tawnos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Candelabra+of+Tawnos). In the end, this tremendous amount of colorless mana leads to a dealer's choice of Eldrazi.


**Ad Nauseam** Tendrils – ANT is the prototypical Legacy storm deck. With access to all of the mana accelerators in *Magic*'s history, ANT uses a myriad of tutor effects to put together a massive turn, often involving [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam), culminating with a massive [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) or [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony). Since most of the deck costs zero or one mana, Ad Nauseum provides a glimpse at virtually the entire deck, making it quite easy to assemble the pieces.


**Shardless** – Most commonly a BUG deck, Shardless decks are so named for Shardless Agent, notable primarily for being a three-mana cascade spell. The Agent provides a number of beneficial two-for-one effects thanks to cascade, from [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) to [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s to [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). The aggression in the deck is generally relegated to [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), Agent, and [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) (that two life adds up), and the deck surrounds that with a shell of permission, removal, and discard.


**Elves** – A rare creature-based combo deck, Elves is one of the most unique decks in the format. Thanks to [Glimpse of Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+of+Nature), Elves is able to turbo through its deck, generating absurd amounts of mana through a combination of [Nettle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel) and [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid). [Quirion Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quirion+Ranger) and [Wirewood Symbiote](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Symbiote) provide a stream of creatures, ensuring that the deck keeps going. Eventually, it uses that massive creature base and mana production to either drop a lethal [Craterhoof Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craterhoof+Behemoth) or an [Ezuri, Renegade Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%2C+Renegade+Leader), into play. Opponents don't usually last much longer.

**Painter** – This vein of decks generally focuses on the [Painter's Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant)/[Grindstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grindstone) combo, where you make all of the cards in both decks the same color, allowing a single [Grindstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grindstone) activation to mill an opponent out. There are variants of the deck featuring [Imperial Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperial+Recruiter) as a method of searching for [Painter's Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant) or [Goblin Welder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder) to help assemble the combo. When in doubt, the deck is still capable of a large amount of mana production, and it can use it to power out a fast [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine).


**Dredge** – At one point in history, it was impossible to play Legacy without dedicating half of your sideboard to dealing with graveyard-based strategies. Dredge is the reason. Using the powerful dredge mechanic to fill the graveyard up, Dredge bypasses most of the "standard" parts of the game, just dumping cards into the graveyard before returning [Flayer of the Hatebound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+of+the+Hatebound) to play with [Dread Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return). This is usually accomplished by sacrificing [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)s that came into play for free, meaning that mana is not an issue. Combined with copies of [Bridge from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) in the graveyard, [Flayer of the Hatebound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+of+the+Hatebound) ends the game in a flurry of triggers. Nowadays, there is considerably less hate around for the graveyard, but its utter reliance on dodging hate has kept Dredge from reaching the pinnacle in recent months.


**Death and Taxes** – Effectively a Legacy White Weenie deck, D&T relies on not allowing opponents to do anything, all while pressuring them with an increasing army of creatures. The myriad of creatures available to D&T provide all sorts of versatility to the deck. [Phyrexian Revoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Revoker) functions as an attacking [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle). [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben), and [Ethersworn Canonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist) are nightmares for combo decks. [Aven Mindcensor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor) is just good against all of the various fetch lands and tutors running rampant in Legacy. At the heart of everything, the deck relies on [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) and [Mirran Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader) to provide the finishing punch.
