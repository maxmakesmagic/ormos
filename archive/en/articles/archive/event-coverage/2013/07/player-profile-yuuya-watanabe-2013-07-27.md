There is very little that Yuuya Watanabe has left to accomplish in his relatively young **Magic** career.


From his debut as a Rookie of the Year in 2007, he has amassed an incredible number of impressive finishes, including an amazing four Grand Prix titles in an eleven month span and a stretch of five Top 8s across a stretch of six Grand Prix events. He has been a Player of the Year twice. He has represented Japan at the World Championships. He even comes into this event as the defending champion, having taken fellow Japanese countryman Shouta Yasooka out in the finals of last year's Players Championship. The only title that has really eluded him is that of Pro Tour Champion, a mark he narrowly missed as he finished second to Stanislav Cifka at Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* earlier this season.


Still, Watanabe is such a strong player that he is always a threat to win any event that he enters. No player is chosen as an early favorite to win an event as much as Watanabe, even in a field as stacked as the one here at the 2013 **Magic** World Championship. His dominance throughout his career has been nothing short of incredible, racking up an impressive 65% win percentage over the course of his career. He is utterly terrifying to sit across the table from, yet he is also one of the nicest players on the Pro Tour today. Always quick with a massive smile and laugh, Watanabe is a paragon of what **Magic** players should strive to be, a champion on all fronts.
