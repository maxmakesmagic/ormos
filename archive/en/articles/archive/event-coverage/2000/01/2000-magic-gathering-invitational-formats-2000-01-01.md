*by Mark Rosewater*


The preliminary rounds of the **Magic** Invitational will consist of fifteen matches (best two out of three) with each player facing off against every other player once. The two players with the best record at the end of the fifteen rounds will meet in the finals. The finals will consist of five matches (best two out of three games each) with the two finalists playing each of the five formats. The winner will be the first player to win matches in three formats. Order of these final matches will be predetermined but can be changed if agreed upon by the two finalists.


The fifteen preliminary rounds will consist of five different formats: three constructed and two limited. Each format will be used for three matches.

3) **Auction of Champions** - All seventeen Pro Tour and World Championship winning constructed decks (listed below) will be auctioned off. The person who successfully bids on a deck in the draft will play that deck for all three rounds of this format. (Decks will be provided for this format.)


The auction will work as such. Players will be numbered one through sixteen based on their order of current standing in the tournament. The first player (number one) selects one of the seventeen decks. He must then place a bid on the nominated deck.


Bids must name a starting hand size and starting life total (seven cards, twenty life being the top bid). The next player must pass or declare a lower bid. If a player passes they are removed from the remainder of the bidding for the current deck. 


Starting hand size is considered the primary bid with starting life total the secondary bid. This means that a bid of "five cards, twenty life" is considered lower than a bid of "six cards, one life". The player with the lowest bid plays that deck in the tournament.


After the bidding ends, the next player numerically (player number two if he did not take the first deck, for example) who has not yet nominated a deck, selects a new deck. If all players have nominated decks, the nomination returns to the player with the lowest number. After all sixteen players have drafted decks, the auction ends. Note this means that one deck will not be drafted.


The seventeen decks for the auction will be the following: (For full deck lists [click here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/auction-champions-decks-2015-10-13).)

### Limited Formats


All limited events will have a forty card deck minimum size restriction. The following are the limited formats used at the 2000 Magic Invitational:


1) **Duplicate** - All competitors will receive an identical card mix from which to construct their deck.


2) **Solomon Draft** - This is a two player draft format. A randomly selected player begins by flipping up eight cards from the top of the card pile. He divides the eight cards into two piles (the piles need not be of the same size) allowing the other player to chose which pile to draft. The two players alternate dividing and drafting until all the cards have been selected. Each match will have a new draft involving different cards.
