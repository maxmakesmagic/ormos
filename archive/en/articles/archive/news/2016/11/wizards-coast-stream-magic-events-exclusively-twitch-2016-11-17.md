Wizards of the Coast and Twitch, the world’s leading social video platform and community for gamers, are proud to announce today a partnership making Twitch the exclusive video content broadcast, streaming, and distribution partner for *Magic* premier play events.


This collaboration is intended to deliver the best *Magic* coverage and streaming experience for fans around the world. This will translate into more coverage for *Magic* events and improved coverage quality for a wider audience.


“We’ve had a strong relationship with Twitch for years, and this agreement will make our partnership stronger and push coverage of our flagship *Magic* events to a new level,” said Helene Bergeot, Wizards of the Coast Director of Organized Play. “We’re incredibly excited to work together to grow the viewership of *Magic* premier play events.”


"The *Magic* community’s enthusiasm in supporting their game’s competitive scene has stood out on Twitch since Wizards began streaming tournaments,” said Twitch Chief Operating Officer Kevin Lin. “Having been a *Magic* player since the tail end of *Unlimited*, seeing Wizards of the Coast partner with Twitch is a strong step in helping to grow the competitive scene.”


Twitch will be the exclusive streaming provider—outside of Japan and China—for *Magic* Grand Prix, Pro Tours, World Championships, as well as the [World *Magic* Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/2016wmc), which is taking place this weekend in Rotterdam, the Netherlands and streaming on [Twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).


Additionally, the partnership will allow Wizards of the Coast to stream more of its international events in English, collaborate on sponsorships, and ultimately make the *Magic* viewing experience among the best in the world.
