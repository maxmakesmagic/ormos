The most popular decks at the Latin America Championship were Replenish, Angry Hermit and Control Black.


Many people saw the success Jon Finkel playing Control Black at US Nationals and quickly built a similar deck for themselves. Angry Hermit has been popular among som of the Latin America countries since they saw the deck from US Regionals report (some of the players emailed Aaron Forsythe about the deck). Replenish is ever-present in the current Standard environment and is very popular among the top players, especially from Brazil and Mexico. A large group of Brazilian players also chose to play Ponza, although it was not popular for players of other countries.


This event, along with various national tournaments (including US Nationals) will studied by players who are preparing for the APAC Championship, Euro Championship and World Championships.
