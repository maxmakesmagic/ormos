 Climbing the standings ladder is typically something ascribed to Constructed decks. They're played for more rounds, are intriguing to discover, and enjoy a place as the source of highlight reel moments from these events. But finding success in your Day Two draft is a significant factor in setting up a Top 8 run players can't overlook.




 Guillaume Wafo-Tapa may not carry a current rank among the Top 25 players, but don't let that fool you: with a victory at Pro Tour Yokohama and three more Pro Tour Top 8s behind it (including at Pro Tour *Theros* back in October) speaks to the caliber of player he is. Add in a World Championship finals with seven Grand Prix Top 8s and you have the recipe for a Pro Tour Hall of Fame candidate.



Wafo-Tapa's opponent features eerily similar stats. No. 19 Ranked Player Paul Rietzl was the Pro Tour Amsterdam champion with three other Pro Tour Top 8s in his career, including a final appearance at Pro Tour Paris. He summed his career succinctly earlier in the day as "I haven't played in an event other than a Grand Prix or Pro Tour in ten years." With two Grand Prix wins among his nine Top 8 finishes, Rietzl is also a regular feature of Pro Tour Hall of Fame candidate discussions.



 Did we mention that both Wafo-Tapa and Rietzl were in the Pro Tour *Theros* Top 8?



Similarities even went down to their choice of one of their colors for their decks: green. In covering No 2. Ranked Reid Duke's draft earlier we caught a few details about what Rietzl had found in his.



 "I agonized between [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) and [Reaper of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds)," Rietzl said, describing his first pick from *Theros* in his draft. I took the [Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap)er but it's stronger, right? The next pack shipped me one too." Flashing [Pharika, God of Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%2C+God+of+Affliction)s and more in his deck promised plenty of power would appear in the match.






*No. 19 Ranked Player Paul Rietzl boasts an impressive career, including a Pro Tour victory and a Top 8 at Pro Tour *Theros*...*
