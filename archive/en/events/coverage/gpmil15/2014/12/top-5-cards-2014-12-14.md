These were the cards that shaped the tournament, that sparked discussions and were the most debated, the cards that won games and turned Grand Prix Milan into an event to remember ...



Summoning Trap
==============



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=197527&type=card)What is the most broken mana acceleration in the format? Well, the layout gives it way, doesn't it? With [Summoning Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap) it's possible to get [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) onto the battlefield and not just save nine mana compared to its MRSP but not to spend any mana at all! Nam Sung-Wook even used [Summoning Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap) for an awesome turn-three kill on Saturday when his unsuspecting opponent foolishly dared to point [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) at his [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder).

Primeval Titan
==============



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=241832&type=card)The good ol' Titan has been one of the heaviest hitter of the entire Grand Prix. It has been played on turn two via [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor) and [Summer Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom) all the way into the Top 8 and was a centerpiece in a lot of Red-Green [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift)/Through the [Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breach) decks. The trampling titan brings an angle of its own to the format thanks to it's ability to fetch everything from [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) to [Slay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slay)ers' Stronghold. It even trumps [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) in an old-fashioned brawl on the battlefield. Many Titans were cast this weekend, winning games left and right for their masters.

Gitaxian Probe
==============



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=233056&type=card)The free card draw spell was surely one of the most-cast spells of the weekend. It was everywhere! Spending a card and getting a card (plus a little information) in return may not look like a great deal at first sight, but whether it's [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) or [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) or [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise)â€”there are just so many other cards that profit from an extra spell being played or an extra card put into the graveyard.

Delver of Secrets
=================



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=226749&type=card)While another card ended up on top at the very end (keep reading), the truth of the matter is that blue tempo decks based on (or at least named after) [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) made up the biggest share of all Day 2 decks. Some had green and used [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) alongside [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), some had white and used [Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft) alongside [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), but all of them very definitely had four [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets).

Birthing Pod
============



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=218006&type=card)If there is a ghost of Modern's past it's surely [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). At Grand Prix Madrid, the talk of the town had been the new broken cards [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), but in fact [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) had been the most-played card in the Top 8 then. This weekend proved once again that [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) is as strong as the latest fashion, taking Magnus Lantto all the way to victory. Interesting to note, the latest generation of Pod decks seem to use it increasingly as an extra card-advantage engine rather than a combo enabler. But let's be honest. Who doesn't dream about searching out [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) with [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) and to blink it on the next turn with [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel).
