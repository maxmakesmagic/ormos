The New Grand Prix Season Commences!
====================================



The first season of Grand Prix has come to a close, with invitations to Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* locked down and in place. But with 54 GPs in total, the 2015 Grand Prix line-up is just getting started, and this next season is a big one!




Pro Tour *Magic Origins*
========================



The Grand Prix main events from March 5 to May 31 all award Top 8 finishers with airfare as well as invitations to compete in Pro Tour *Magic Origins*, which takes place in Vancouver July 31–August 2. It's also the last Pro Tour before the end of the 2014–2015 Premier Play season, meaning that this will be the last opportunity for players to earn Pro Points toward [Pro Players Club](http://magic.wizards.com/en/node/153711) status before the new season begins!



With so much on the line at this Pro Tour, it's sure to be a thrilling weekend for Pro Tour veterans and newcomers alike! If you'd like to earn your opportunity to battle in what is always one of the most exciting Pro Tours every year, let's go through each month to see what Grand Prix opportunities are available to you!




March
=====



The month of March features four different Grand Prix across the world!



March 6–8 features a double Grand Prix weekend split across two continents. While England will be playing host to a *Khans of Tarkir*/*Fate Reforged* Limited main event at [Grand Prix Liverpool](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-liverpool-2015), the sandy beaches of [Miami will host a Standard Constructed Grand Prix](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-miami-2015) main event.



A week later, March 13–15 will feature GPs in the United States and New Zealand. Both [Grand Prix Auckland](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-auckland-2015) and [Grand Prix Cleveland](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-cleveland-2015) will play home to a *Khans of Tarkir* / *Fate Reforged* main event.




April
=====



The month of April highlights [Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-tour-dragons-tarkir-event-information) and, with such a busy month of top-level *Magic* action, features only one double-Grand Prix weekend. Poland and Japan will be the hosts for the month's GPs on April 17–19, with [Grand Prix Krakow](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-krakow-2015) highlighting Standard Constructed for its main event while [Grand Prix Kyoto](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-kyoto-2015) features Eternal action with a Legacy Constructed main event.




May
===



While April is a little light in Grand Prix action, the month of May boasts one very epic lineup of events.



It all starts on May 1–3, with Standard Constructed Grand Prix main events in [Sao Paulo, Brazil](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/grand-prix-event-types-events), as well as [Toronto, Canada](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-toronto-2015).



A week later, another two GPs include a *Dragons of Tarkir* Limited main event at [Grand Prix Atlantic City](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-atlantic-city-2015) while [Paris, France](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-paris-2015), hosts a Standard Constructed main event.



Then, May 15-17 will include a Team Limited main event in Florence, Italy, while Shanghai, China, hosts a Standard Constructed main event.



And then, to round out this season of Grand Prix that qualifies players for Pro Tour *Magic Origins*, we'll be bringing you a triple threat with a global celebration of [*Modern Masters 2015 Edition*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/modern-masters-2015-edition)*.* The hosting locations for this exciting weekend filled with all kinds of Modern goodness will be Chiba, Utrecht, and Las Vegas, with festivities kicking off on Thursday, May 28, for the Grand Prix in the Netherlands and the United States.



The *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* Grand Prix experience is not something you will want to miss.



With fifteen Grand Prix over the course of the next season, there's plenty of *Magic* Premier Play to enjoy around the globe. We hope to see you at one of them!
