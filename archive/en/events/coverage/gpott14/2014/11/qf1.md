Samuel Black is currently ranked fourteenth in the world in the Pro Player Power Rankings. Black has a staggering nine Grand Prix Top 8s to his name and two Pro Tour Top 8s on top of that. Black is one of the most well-respected players in the world and it's no surprise to see him in another Top 8. 



 His opponent, Neal Oliver, is no slouch either. Oliver won Grand Prix Las Vegas, the largest *Magic* event of all time. Then, in his very next event, Oliver made it to the finals at Grand Prix San Jose. More recently, Oliver won a WMCQ qualifier to earn a spot on the United States National Team for the World *Magic* Cup.



While waiting for the match to start. Oliver and Black exchanged stories about their experiences in the swiss rounds of the tournament. 



 Black got on the table quickly with [Disowned Ancestor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disowned+Ancestor), but Neil had a plan of his own. [Secret Plans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secret+Plans) came down on the second turn and threatened to take over the game by itself if left unchecked.




 Both players emptied their hands quickly and soon the board was a mess while Oliver was cracking through with [Jeskai Windscout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Windscout).




 That all changed in the blink of an eye when Black broke the stalemate with a backbreaking [Incremental Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incremental+Growth), though. He started charging into the red zone and Oliver, ahead many cards, quickly found himself chump blocking just to survive.
