![Justin Gary vs. Tomi Walamies](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/964.jpg)Arguably, Justin Gary is the most successful Extended player in history. He's won a Masters and a Pro Tour in this format, and did both with the same deck- [Oath of Druids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids). So, it's not surprising that even in this environment filled to the brim with artifacts, Gary is running what he's familiar with. This is not to say that he came unprepared, as his deck has its fair share of artifact removal, and got a boost from [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter). Walamies is playing the red/blue [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder)/[Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) deck, which can turn opponents into spectators when it gets going.

### Game 1

Walamies had a first turn [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder), and Gary played an island and [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox). [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) and [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) led to Walamies casting [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), which was [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)ed. A [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) was countered with [Forbid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbid), and Gary played [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village). An artifact land gave the Welder something to work with, as it got a [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) out of the graveyard, which led to [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) and [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver). On end step Gary cast [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), getting [Shattering Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattering+Pulse). This let him destroy the [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) with buyback, although Walamies still had the Welder to bring it back. If Walamies wanted to ever activate a [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), he would want an artifact in play he didn't care about, so that he could get the [Shattering Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattering+Pulse) out of Gary's hand. This put him in a situation where he had to set things up a bit, so he cast [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), and used the Welder to get a fresh, untapped Monolith, which brought out [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker). 

![Rasta-Gary](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/963.jpg)Gary untapped, and cast [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to get the [Fire/Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire%2FIce) under [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) (it was removed from the game for imprint), and used it to kill the Welder, taking [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) recursion out of the picture. Walamies summoned [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus), which died to [Shattering Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattering+Pulse) (but not before making a 1/1 flier). If buyback artifact destruction wasn't good enough, Gary put [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) on [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter). One by one, Walamies' artifacts went to the graveyard, as the "[Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) on a stick" made sure nothing changed. From this position, it was easy for Gary to send his [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) in to do the rest.

### Game 2

Walamies started the game exactly the way he wanted to, dropping a first turn [Defense Grid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defense+Grid) onto the table, followed by [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire). [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) followed, but died to Fire before it could become active. Just when it seemed that Walamies had the edge, Gary shifted the game advantage tremendously with [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter), imprinted with [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize). [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus) provided a reasonable threat for the situation, as it split into smaller tokens, making it harder for the Scepter to handle. It got through for damage and [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) would have made the board position ever better, but Gary had [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). The Scepter took down the [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus), which made tokens before dying. The resulting attack brought Gary down to six, and another to one life point. [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) on end step got [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to buy Gary a reprieve, and Walamies summoned [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder). Gary used [Krosan Reclamation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation) to shuffle the [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus) back into the library where it couldn't be recurred, and Walamies' attack forced Gary to flash back [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to stay alive. The Welder brought back [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire), and Gary conceded.

### Game 3

![A classic Walamies moment](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/962.jpg)This time around, when Walamies played [Defense Grid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defense+Grid), Gary had [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) resolved, and Gary played [Oath of Druids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids). The [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) activated to show a hand of [Citanul Flute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citanul+Flute), [Mishra's Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Helix), two artifact lands, [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) and another [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker). The Helix was [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)ed, and [Citanul Flute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citanul+Flute) resolved, getting [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder), which went right into play. [Oath of Druids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) activated, dumping a significant portion of Gary's library into the graveyard, and bringing an 11/11 [Cognivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cognivore) into play. Walamies played [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and activated it, and used the remaining floating mana to get [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus) with [Citanul Flute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citanul+Flute). Gary was now in a bad position, facing down turns where Walamies could keep activating [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and mill away his library. [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) on end step searched up [Krosan Reclamation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation), which targeted the [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), but in response Walamies put it into play with the Welder. On Gary's turn, Walamies activated the Oath, and rather than reveal his entire deck en route to being decked, Gary conceded.
