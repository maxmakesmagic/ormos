Wizards of the Coast International Customer Service just got a lot more...serviceable.

Wizards of the Coast has been working to expand its customer service offerings for some time, and this represents the most recent step in the increasing globalization of this great game (and other Wizards of the Coast products).


The Game Support team is here to help you with a variety of issues, including, but not limited to:


**Magic Online** Support
Game Rules Questions
DCI Account Support
Billing Support Questions
