The art for [Increasing Devotion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Increasing+Devotion) shows soldiers rallying around a statue of an angel.

We might as well start off by pointing out that it's a statue of Avacyn. So you can get a feel for what the top of the spear looks like by examining the art at the bottom of the [*Avacyn Restored* announcement](/en/node/662516). But what about the bottom of the statue? What about the *back* of the bottom of the statue? There's no way to know what that looks like!

Unless, of course, there's another piece of art that's set at the same statue, but showing an entirely different segment of it.
