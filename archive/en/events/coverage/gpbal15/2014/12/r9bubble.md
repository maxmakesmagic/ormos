After a long, grinding day of *Khans of Tarkir* Sealed matches, 133 players found themselves on the bubble going into the final round of Day 1, needing one more win to reach the 21-point threshold needed to come back and draft on Sunday.


At Table 80, No. 1 Owen Turtenwald faced down Michael Rothkopf for a spot in Day 2. Turtenwald was quick to the board with a pair of outlasters in [Ainok Bond-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Bond-Kin) and [Salt Road Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salt+Road+Patrol), along with a vigilant flyer in [Alabaster Kirin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Kirin). His opponent fought back with a [Mardu Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hordechief), which brought along its raiding Warrior friend. An attack from Rothkopf triggered raid once again, allowing a [Mardu Heart-Piercer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Heart-Piercer) to shoot down Turtenwald's Bond-Kin.


A [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) from Turtenwald then swung the life totals to 24-14 in his favor, and [Rakshasa's Secret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa%27s+Secret) took care of the [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm) and [Force Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Away) in Rothkopf's hand, leaving him hellbent. Turtenwald's [Smite the Monstrous](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smite+the+Monstrous) smote a [Glacial Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Stalker), and a few attacks later his 3/5 [Salt Road Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salt+Road+Patrol) had won him Game 1.





*Owen Turtenwald's Abzan outlast creatures endured an onslaught of raiding Jeskai Warriors to win Game 1.*
