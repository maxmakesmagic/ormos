[Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil)


The Season 1 (December) MOPR period runs from November 25, 2015, through December 30, 2015. Here are the promo cards:


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/card_promo_MOPR_anticipate.png)![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/card_promo_MOPR_accumulated_knowledge_temp.png)

| Event Promo[Anticipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anticipate) | Store Promo[Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) |

Please note, the [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) shown above is not the promo that will be awarded on *Magic Online*. The *Magic Online* promo will use the same art, but will have the *Magic Online* expansion symbol and a *Magic Online* frame.


Play in one or more events the MOPR period, and you’ll get a non-premium [Anticipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anticipate). Five or more and you’ll get an additional premium [Anticipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anticipate). Spend at least $20 total in the *Magic Online* Store during Season 1, and you’ll get a non-premium [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge). By spending $40 or more, you’ll get an additional, premium, [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge).


And remember, this means it's your last chance to get the 2015 Season 12 MOCS and MOPR promos, like this [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/card_promo_MOCS_griselbrand.png)
Earning 15 Qualifier Points (QPs) in Season 12 will earn you a copy of this season's MOCS promo card. You get one promo for every 15 QPs you earn. Players can earn QPs from MOCS Events, PTQ Events, Release Events, and more! Get more details about the 2015 *Magic Online* Championship Series [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/2015-magic-online-championship-series).


Please keep in mind, the way players earn MOCS promos changes with the [2016 *Magic Online* Championship Series](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2016-magic-online-championship-series). Going forward, MOCS promos will rotate Quarterly and they will be earned as prizes in the Quarterly Playoff events.


*Magic Online* Player Rewards (MOPR) promos are earned a bit differently. In the MOPR program, *Magic Online* players are rewarded for participating in tournaments of a sufficient size, as well as making purchases in the *Magic Online* Store. Learn about the specifics of the program [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2015-magic-online-player-rewards).
