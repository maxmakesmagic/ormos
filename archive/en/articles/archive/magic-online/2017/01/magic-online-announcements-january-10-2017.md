**Build notes**


General | *Magic Online* player rewards for December have been granted. Those cards are listed in this article.


Play Lobby | Joining an event now always asks which deck youâ€™d like to use.


League | Leagues that end after a certain number of wins or losses now correctly display trophies.


League | Fixed a bug that caused players to become unable to complete a league after a match was nullified.


Collection and Trade | Added an "Add More" option when choosing objects to add to a Trade Binder or active Trade.


Collection | Fixed and issue where dragging card from a pile with different card frames would not correctly update the quantity counter.


Collection | Fixed a bug that prevented players from adding a card through the right-click context menu if a deck already contains a different version of that card.


Collection | Basic lands from sets not owned by the player will now show in the collection when filters are set appropriately.


Store | Added VAT for store purchases from Norway, Switzerland, and Russia.


Duel Scene | Card names are no longer affected by the profanity filter in the game log.


Account | Windows 10 users can now change the save location for draft logs.


In addition to these changes, during Wednesday's update, *Magic Online* is adding a new option to the Collection scene to improve adding items with large quantities to your trade binders: "Add More to Active Trade Binder."

This option, found in the right-click context menu on items in your Collection, lets you select the number of items you want to your active trade binder, rather than being limited to one item at a time or all items. After you select the Add More option, a dialog will open defaulted to all of that item, but you can edit the quantity you want to add, either by using the up and down arrows or typing in a number in the quantity field. This feature will be most useful for managing those high quantity items, like Event Tickets or common cards accumulated through drafting.
