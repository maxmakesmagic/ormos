Riddle time: 

This goblin (pictured on [Goblin Grenade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Grenade) from *Fallen Empires*) has named his spear. Can you tell from the art what his spear's name is?

Yep, it's Mike, as you can see spelled out on the spikes. Fine name for a spear, don't you think? (It's actually the name of a buddy of the artist, Ron Spencer. Ron is fond of hiding names in his art.)
