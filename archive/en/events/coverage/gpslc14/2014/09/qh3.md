 As the final limited Grand Prix before the release of *Khans of Tarkir*, Grand Prix Salt Lake City is the last time players from around the world will gather to play *Magic 2015* sealed and draft. With weeks to practice with the format in preparation for the tournament, players have had plenty of time to figure out which cards they most want to see when they crack open a pack. We talked to some of the best in the game to find out what they thought.
