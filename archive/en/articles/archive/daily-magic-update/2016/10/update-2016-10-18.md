The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 18, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by all of you. Because I'm thrilled to be back writing on the internet in your general direction. You complete me. You had me at hello. You've got something on your nose.


Today's Must
============


1. [Top Ten *Magic* Artists of All Time](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/abesargent-10182016-top-ten-magic-artists-of-all-time/) | Gathering Magic | Abe Sargent

This list is as subjective as they come (eye of the beholder, and all that), but man if it isn't a fantastic conversation starter. I would imagine my Top 10 would look different, and yours would as well. But at least we can all agree on one thing—everyone else is wrong and my subjective list is objectively the best.


Check out Sargent's version, then chime in on what artists you think are the best.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [The Winners and Losers of Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13566&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=10-18-2016) | TCGPlayer | Seth Manfield

The winners were everyone who likes Standard and are thrilled for a new, interesting, *Kaladesh*-infused format. The losers are those of us who still are stuck on Hawaii time.


Or, Manfield goes over what strategies and cards benefited and lost from the results in Honolulu. That too. But, also, the time zones thing. Now where is my coffee?


1. [Channel LSV—Standard Colossus Affinity](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-lsv-standard-colossus-affinity/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

Quietly one of the coolest decks to come out of the Pro Tour (see the [Deck of the Day](#10)) was the Temur Colossus deck that sought to cast [Metalwork Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalwork+Colossus) on the cheap. Luis was doing coverage all weekend, but he clearly was jonesing for a little Colossus action once all was said and done.


1. [Podcast 091: Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/podcast-091-pro-tour-kaladesh) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive and Chaz V

If you follow SaffronOlive on Twitter, you know he has many opinions and thoughts. This week, he has many opinions and thoughts, and shares them in podcast form alongside Chaz V!


1. [Constructed Criticism 157: Pro Tour Reactions](http://www.constructedcriticism.com/podcasts/constructed-criticism-157-pro-tour-reactions/) | Constructed Criticism | Spencer Howland, Manny Meraz, Casey Bloodworth, Drew Walden, and Michael Hinderaker

And if you liked one podcast about the Pro Tour, why not two?


1. [Black-Green Aggro Deck Guide](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/gb-aggro-deck-guide/) | ChannelFireball | Eric Froehlich

Eric Froehlich went lone wolf at Pro Tour *Kaladesh*, and the result was an 8-2 Standard record with a very powerful Black-Green Delirium deck. Though he sputtered on Day Two in Draft, the deck was certainly strong enough to put him in Top 8 contention early on, as he started out as one of only two undefeated players after Day One.


1. [Top 8 Decks from Pro Tour *Kaladesh*!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfQdYxpWEbE) | Strictly Better MTG

Haven't had enough commentary on Pro Tour *Kaladesh*? Me either! Let's face it, that's most of what you're getting this week. Here, Strictly Better covers the Top 8 decks, which had a little bit of everything.

1. [*Commander (2016 Edition)* Preview is a week from today](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/151943847778/commander-2016-preview-is-a-week-from-today) | Blogatog | Mark Rosewater

Well, now a week from yesterday. So tune in next Monday as we show off this year's edition of the popular *Commander* lineup. I know I've got my new Commander picked out.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Temur Colossus](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptkld/21-23-point-standard-decklists-2016-10-16)

Want to go big? Like, really big? Oliver Polak-Rottmann did so to the tune of a 7-3 record in Standard at Pro Tour *Kaladesh* last weekend with [Metalwork Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalwork+Colossus), a giant creature that Polak-Rottmann could, with some frequency, cast for free or very close to it.


The deck uses a variety of useful artifacts to gum up the board and, just as importantly, reduce the cost of [Metalwork Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalwork+Colossus). From there, [Sanctum of Ugin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+of+Ugin) can be sacrificed to find another colossus or an [Elder Deep-Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Deep-Fiend), as the situation calls for it.


The deck is a *Kaladesh* invention through and through, and that inventiveness will likely be coming to a Friday Night *Magic* near you very soon.
