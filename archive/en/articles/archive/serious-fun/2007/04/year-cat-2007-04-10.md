Today's card is going to make you tingle all over. And I *mean* that. This card is going to do something to you that *no other card has done before*. This card's special, baby. Like the very first time. 

Aw, heck. Why waste your time with an extended intro? We all know what you came for.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/serious/tf29_regitsthes.jpg)

That's right, folks; now your creatures don't have protection from red. *You* do. Which means we finally get to answer the eternal question: 

*What does having protection feel like*? 

As a strong Vorthos player, I've always wanted to know. Was it, like, a big shield that hovered over you like an invisible umbrella? Or were you encased in a magical bubble wrap that boinged away any attempts to pour molten lava on your head? Or maybe it was a big, hard-to-put on suit of armor that clanked a lot and upset the wife when you walked around the house. 

I can tell you, though, finally having experienced it, that having protection is like sliding on a set of warm pajamas, fresh out of the dryer. With a hint of mint. *Mmmm*, that's good stuff, baby. 

Seriously, though, this is a pretty awesome card, and kudos to Wizards for printing it. Unfortunately, since "protection from X" is something that routinely confuses the heck out of new players (I know—I edited StarCityGames.com's "Ask The Judge" section for years, and eventually added it to our [Top 10 Most Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.starcitygames.com/pages/askjudge.php)), let's start off by discussing the things that Seht's Tiger *cannot* do: 

* *It cannot save your creatures from mass destruction*. Just because you’re safe from red damage sources does not mean that said protection extends to your creatures (any more than your [Soltari Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Priest) having protection from red keeps you safe from a [Disintegrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disintegrate) to the head). So if someone plays a [Volcano Hellion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcano+Hellion) and targets your [Akroma, Angel of Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Fury) for 6 damage, Seht’s Tiger will not save your pretty little unmorphed angel from her inevitable tumble to the graveyard.
* *It cannot save you from non-targeted effects*. A Blood Knight is safe from a [Sunlance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunlance) because “protection from white” means that you cannot target a creature with a white spell. Simple, right? Ah, but Wrath of God does not say “destroy target creature,” it says “destroy all creatures”! Thus, your [Blood Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight)’s protection does not prevent it from being destroyed. Likewise, there are many spells and effects that do not *target* players, but affect them nonetheless; [Mindlash Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindlash+Sliver) says that “each player” must discard a card, so Seht’s Tiger will not prevent the effect. ([Mindstab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindstab) or [Haunting Hymn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Hymn), however? They do say “target,” so Seht’ll keep your hand safe.)
* *It cannot save you from things that don’t target you, the player*. Extirpate? That’s targeting a card in *your graveyard*, not you personally. So Seht’s Tiger cannot protect you!
* *It cannot do your laundry.* Seht’s Tiger is a good card, but thanks to protection from colors, it never gets the whites separated.
* *It cannot do Sudoku puzzles.* It’s a cat.
* *It may not pass “Go,” nor may it collect $200.* It does, however, prefer to be the shoe.

All right, all right! And the truth is that Seht's Tiger is a *very good* card (particularly in multiplayer). For ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) it's got a pretty solid body at 3/3, and the whole "flash" thing is awesome. But the danger of Seht[\*](#footnote1) is that beginning players who do not understand the rules may think it is a Swiss Army Knife of protection spells.... Whereas actually, it's a beautifully crafted dagger. It can do some things very, *very* well. 

So let's talk about the things that Seht's Tiger *can* do!

* ![Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Greater+Gargadon)*It can save you from a fatal alpha strike*. Because when you have protection from a color, all sources of damage from that color are reduced to zero! Nothing! Nada! They do zip to you! So if someone’s attacking with his horde of Thallids and Saprolings, give yourself protection from green and you’re utterly safe!
* *It can put you in the catbird’s seat (heh) when choosing to block*. “Ah ha,” says Mister Ugly Opponent. “I’m going to be mean and send my huge 9/7 [Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon) at you, along with this handy pair of 2/2s! You only have one creature out, and you *have* to block my 9/7 or you will die, and… What? There’s a 3/3 there now to block one of my 2/2s? And since you now have protection from red, you can afford to let my Gargadon through to your face? And that means you can block my other 2/2 with your remaining guy, meaning that… Yeah, my offense just got obliterated. Dang!”
* *It can save you from silly combo decks that target you*. “Hi, I have an infinite storm count. I think I’ll cast [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony), and now there are ten copies of it, each aimed straight at you…. Whuh? Protection from *what*? I can’t target *who*? Dang.”
* *It can counter spells with a single target*. Cast that [Corrupt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt) at me? Fine. Now I have protection from black, so the spell fails and *you* gain no life. Sorry, sucka.
* *It can save you from spells that do damage to you*. Squall Line does X damage to each creature and “each player,” which means it doesn’t target you. As mentioned before, protection won’t stop a spell from affecting you if it doesn’t target. But one of the cool things about “protection from a color” is that *all* damage from sources of that color is reduced to zero. So the Squall Line will do, say, 15 damage to everyone else and none to you, which means that you’re probably the last man standing.
* *It affects multicolored cards, too*. Don’t forget; a green-black spell is both a green and a black spell, so protection from green *will* protect you from a [Gleancrawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gleancrawler). Most of you probably know this, but what the heck.
* *In a pinch, it can be a surprise attacker.* Don’t get greedy; sometimes, you just need a 3/3 body to finish someone off. Remember, you don’t always *have* to use the protection effect, and it’s perfectly okay to play it at someone else’s end of turn so that you can bum rush the show with your spanking-new [Hill Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant).
* *It can cause any “enchant player” cards to fall off of you, sending them straight to the graveyard.* Which sounds cool, but considering there’s a sum total of one enchant player and it’s a spell that you probably play (Paradox Haze), it’s not something that’s very useful…. Yet. Who knows what future spells are coming? (NOTE: Astute readers have noted that there is only one "enchant player" card, but another card enchants an "opponent," which Seht's Tiger would also cause to drop off were it attached to your face: that card is [Psychic Possession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Possession). Still, the threat of [Psychic Possession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Possession) decks at this point in time is not so terrible that you're looking for an out.)
* *It’s a Cat.* Cats are a cool creature type. Ask Selina Kyle.
* *It can save your place in a book*. “That’s not very impressive, either, Ferrett,” you say. But merely by lodging Seht’s Tiger in between the two pages you last finished, you can open up a book and resume your reading at the point you left off! *And* you can do it at instant speed thanks to its flash!

(Oh, you may not think that last one is critical, but *you* try reading a lapbreaker like *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell* without a bookmark. But yeah, I acknowledge that's probably not going to win you many games.)

Still. What we have here is a solid catch-all combat trick. In the worst case, you've just spent ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) to get a 3/3 and fizzle a single spell from an opponent. But in the best case, you've just stopped some combo player cold by preventing them from targeting you in the turn they go off, *or* you've just foiled someone's all-in attack, *or* you've just frozen a last-ditch [Corrupt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt) to your head. 

Gosh, that sure sounds like a good card. If only there was some cheap way to return it to your hand again, to be reused at your leisure... Something that was... I dunno, maybe catlike....

Ah yes! And what other cats might we combine with this to create a silly kitty deck? Hmm. We all know that Tribal is a pretty darned strong theme in creature-based multiplayer games (at least the ones that haven't been taken over by combo and endless mono-black decks), so you might try this:

![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Forest)

















The idea behind this deck is as simple as a kitty's mind: Generate a large and threatening army of kitties, protecting yourself when necessary with Seht's Tiger. When you're ready to explode, do an end-of-turn [Congregation at Dawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Congregation+at+Dawn) for [Raksha Golden Cub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raksha+Golden+Cub) (hopefully with a [Ronin Warclub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ronin+Warclub) out) and attack in with your large and very threatening kitties. 

You could put in a [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), I suppose, but you don't need to fear global destruction; between your [Penumbra Bobcat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Penumbra+Bobcat)s and your [Arctic Nishoba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arctic+Nishoba)e, you get a benefit when your guys die (and you can save the ones you want with Whitemane). 

Normally, the problem with this sort of deck is that while you're on the offense, you're going to be taking it in the shorts back home. There's no one left to block! But with Seht's Tiger, you now have a way of blunting those nasty attacks when people *think* you're vulnerable... 

![Dawn Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dawn+Elemental)(Throw in [Dawn Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Elemental), which isn't quite kittytastic, but is fun, for extra-good times.) That's not the end of it, though; Seht's Tiger is an awe-inspiring combat trick that may be a little too expensive at four mana to make the grade in two-player Constructed... But in multiplayer, where you have a little more time to set up, and need to squeeze a little more bang for your buck? 

Oh, I love my kitty. Pretty, pretty kitty. 

### For Those of You Who Care: An Explanation of Last Week's "Deck"

Many of you emailed me to note that [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker) doesn't fit in the "Improved" Jack's deck from [last week](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/causing-ruckus-2007-04-03); since [Heartless Hidetsugu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartless+Hidetsugu) and Kumano are both legendary, the only target for Kiki to copy is [Hearth Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami)—which is not, needless to say, a card you're going to win the game by duplicating. 

The flaw lies in my deck "improvement" method; I cut-and-copied Jack's deck and then upped the quantities of some lines while deleting others. What was supposed to get deleted was the singleton Kiki-Jiki, while I changed the number of [Jaya Ballard, Task Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jaya+Ballard%2C+Task+Mage) to 4. Instead, I accidentally deleted Jaya Ballard, and raised it to four Kiki-Jikis, thus creating a very bad deck... And worse, when I looked it over before I sent it, I *saw* Jaya Ballard, not Kiki. 

My apologies for that. Stupid cut-n-paste. 

\* - The danger of Seht's Tiger for *you*, that is. For me, since I write a [webcomic](http://www.homeonthestrange.com) that features a lead character called "Seth," *my* danger is that I've written "Seth's Tiger" at least seventy times in the course of writing this column, and then had to go back and redo *every one of them*. Don't even get me started on "[Faith's Fetters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters)," which because of my name I still automatically type as "Faith's Ferretts."
