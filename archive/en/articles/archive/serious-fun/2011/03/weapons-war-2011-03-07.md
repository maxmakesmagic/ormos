Weapons of War
==============



 Posted in [Serious Fun](/en/articles/columns/serious-fun-archive)

This week is Living Weapon Week, a perfect opportunity to explore what the Phyrexians cooked up for war on Mirrodin. Living weapons are pretty darn spiffy. And that's not just the oil talking.

While casting Equipment that enters the battlefield attached to a creature already has some obvious benefits, it's the fact that living weapons *are* Equipment that makes me appreciate them so much more. I'm an adamant supporter of swinging with creatures, and the stuff of [Rancor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancor), [Stonewood Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonewood+Invocation), and [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) fills me with delight.

Living weapons are no different.

And with an excellent excuse to use all five weapons in their own ways, I present to you five different decks, each one using a different living weapon for different reasons.

Flay the Flesh from Your Bones
I love "Pauper" **Magic**â€”playing with all common cards. Maybe it's the creative restrictions of excluding rarer cards, or the general sense that attacking with creatures will be happening a lot, but working with the most frequently encountered cards is something I enjoy.
