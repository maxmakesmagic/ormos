Matt Cavotta wasn't able to complete his article this week due to several unexpected personal issues that came up over the weekend, but he'll be back in time for next week. 


In the meantime, we thought you might like a sneak preview of one of the amazing things waiting for you in *Guildpact* (and we don't mean just the art). In yesterday's [Magic Arcana](/en/articles/archive/evidence-other-guilds-2005-11-15) we pointed out some of the *Ravnica* cards which offer hints to the mysterious guilds yet to be met. Today we're ready to give you a little more, courtesy of the Izzet.

Want more? *Guildpact* previews begin Monday, January 9!
