Hey, wanna see something cool?


As you know, [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) did not appear in *Shards of Alara*, but it did appear in *Conflux*. Just so you remember it clearly, and because it looks cool blown up, here's the art for [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus):

Almost as if a pre-*Conflux* card hinted at what [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) would look like.

If we blow up the art for [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus), you can even see what its body looks like!
