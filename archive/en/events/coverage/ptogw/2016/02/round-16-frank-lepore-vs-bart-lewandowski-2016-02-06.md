Round 16: Frank Lepore (Processor Eldrazi) vs. Bart Lewandowski (Abzan Company)
===============================================================================

Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






Bart Lewandowski is still fairly new to the Pro Tour. This young Polish player put up a tremendous 11-4-1 record at Pro Tour *Magic Origins*, his first big event. Lewandowski secured Silver status with that finish and a Top 4 at Grand Prix Krakow, and was able to use it to play in this weekend's Pro Tour. A win in this round would give Lewandowski a tremendous Top 16 Pro Tour finish to add to his young career.


His opponent, newcomer Frank Lepore, has a lot more on the line. Lepore is a well-known *Magic* personality that regularly produces content and entertains countless viewers on his popular online stream. This may be Lepore's first Pro Tour, but he's already making his mark, and a win in this round could propel him to a Top 8 berth at his very first big show!


The two discussed the possibility of drawing into Top 16, but the conversation didn't last long. Lepore let out a deep breath and held his hands together. "Let's just play, I guess," Lepore said. "What's one more round of *Magic*?"

*Frank Lepore and Bart Lewandowski were down to one round in the Swiss. A win for Lepore was likely a lock. A win for Lewandowski was a hope. Whose dream would remain alive?*


The Games
=========


Lewandowski kept his opening seven and Lepore went in search of a better six, which he found.


Lewandowski started accelerating with [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and Lepore began churning away with [Scrabbling Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrabbling+Claws). Lewandowski needed to read the card, "What's this do? May I read it?"


Lepore smiled. "Of course you can!" he said.


"So, it's a worse relic."


"That's rude."


"Not rude, just the truth."


[Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) and [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) came next for Lewandowski. Lepore tried to use [Wasteland Strangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland+Strangler) to get [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) off the table, but Lewandowski used his [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) to redirect the triggered ability of [Wasteland Strangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland+Strangler) and maintain his growing board state.


[Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) joined the party for Lewandowski while Lepore was still just working with a [Wasteland Strangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland+Strangler) and [Scrabbling Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrabbling+Claws).


[Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast) came next, and it became clear that Lewandowski was close to a combo finish. Lewandowski blocked [Wasteland Strangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland+Strangler) with [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) and expected it to come back, but Lepore had other plans and used [Scrabbling Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrabbling+Claws) to exile the [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) with the persist trigger on the stack.


"Ack!" Lewandowski winced.


Another [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) meant that Lepore was still under a lot of pressure, and he needed to find a way to turn the tides. He was still trying to operate without [Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin) or [Eldrazi Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple) and his draw hadn't given him the ability to accelerate as he would've liked to. Worse, he was forced to leave mana open to activate the targeted ability on his [Scrabbling Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrabbling+Claws) in case Lewandowski had [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) to search up a sacrifice outlet to combo off.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/ptogw/r16_lewandowski.jpg)  
*Lewandowski has impressed many in his relatively short career.*


Lewandowski did have [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling), and he used it for two after declaring a block with [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) on Lepore's [Wasteland Strangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland+Strangler).


Lepore tapped out for [Blight Herder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blight+Herder), and Lewandowski tried to combo. Lepore used [Scrabbling Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrabbling+Claws) to exile [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) with the persist trigger on the stack. Lewandowski had another [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling), though, and was able to search up [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) and deal lethal damage by repeatedly sacrificing it to his [Viscera Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer) with [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast) in play.


"I threw away a [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) for nothing," Lewandowski lamented. "I thought you would need to sacrifice your [Scrabbling Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrabbling+Claws)."


Lepore nodded politely.


In the second game, Lepore led things off with [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus).


Lewandowski began accelerating with [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots), which enabled [Sigarda, Host of Herons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigarda%2C+Host+of+Herons) on the fourth turn.


Lepore had [Matter Reshaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matter+Reshaper) and [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher), and the race was on. The two traded blows while trading bodies on the ground, and Lepore was eventually able to break serve and secure victory with [Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope) to tap down Lewandowski's remaining blockers and attack for lethal damage.


Both players kept their opening hands to start the third game, and Lewandowski got things going fast with [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). Next came [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) and [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch). Lewandowski was already able to make 5 mana on his third turn!


Lepore had [Eldrazi Mimic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Mimic), and Lewandowski completely whiffed on a [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), which is extremely rare for this Abzan deck that's built around the card. Lepore used [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction) targeting [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), and Lewandowski revealed that he had a second copy in his hand. Now, Lepore only needed to battle his way through a pair of [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) and the cards that came off the top of Lewandowski's deck.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/ptogw/r16_lepore.jpg)  
*Lepore has made the most of his first Pro Tour appearance.*


[Wasteland Strangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland+Strangler) took [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) off the table and traded with [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) on the following turn, while also pumping up [Eldrazi Mimic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Mimic) to be sent into combat. Lepore cast [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer) and continued attacking with the [Eldrazi Mimic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Mimic) that he had played on the second turn. [Matter Reshaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matter+Reshaper) was next, and Lewandowski could only cast [Fulminator Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage) before attacking.


Lewandowski's [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) tokens had grown quite large, and he attacked for five with one of them, prompting Lepore to double block with [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer) and [Matter Reshaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matter+Reshaper).


[Wasteland Strangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland+Strangler) took out [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch), and Lepore continued pressuring Lewandowski's life total. Lepore was presenting lethal damage on the following turn, and Lewandowski would need to start chump blocking if he wanted to survive.


[Fulminator Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage) traded with [Wasteland Strangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland+Strangler) and Lepore dropped Lewandowski down to a precarious 3 life before passing the turn back.


Once again, [Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope) came down, and Lepore was able to tap down enough of Lewandowski's blockers to attack for the last three points of damage.
