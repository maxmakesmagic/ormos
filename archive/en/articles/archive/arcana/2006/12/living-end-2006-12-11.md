*Time Spiral* features a 6-card cycle of suspend cards that mimic the functions of powerful spells from times past. [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) and [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) saw a lot of play at [Worlds](/en/events/coverage/mihara-dutch-crowned-world-champions). One that was encountered less often was [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End), a suspend throwback to the *Tempest* wrecking-ball, [Living Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death).

The art of [Living Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death) depicts a host of zombies rising from their resting places and shoving a living man down into an open grave. The dead burying the living—disturbing!

Now check out the art of *Time Spiral’s* [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End).

You can see that this is another scene of zombies rising from their graves, this time with the “suspend visual cue” of the blue time-barrier. Note that there’s also a little reference to the original [Living Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death) art: Check out the rose growing from the zombie-head in the foreground of [Living Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death). It’s mimicked in the flowers on the head of the zombie in the background of [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End).


Note also that the “suspend visual cue” was added in post-production. Greg Staples’s original didn’t have the electric-blue barrier to represent the spell appearing from a rift in time; it was just a shot of these zombies rising out of the earth. Here’s the original before the post-production changes:
