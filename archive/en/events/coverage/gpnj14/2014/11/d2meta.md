What does it take to make Day 2 of the largest Legacy Grand Prix in *Magic* history? It's a tough question with great answers: This is the complete Day 2 metagame breakdown for Grand Prix New Jersey.

That's... an unwieldy list of decklists. Let's try a slightly smaller summary.





|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Archetype | Percent | Count |
| Blue-Red Delver | 20% | 89 |
| Jeskai Stoneblade | 10% | 44 |
| Death and Taxes | 7% | 31 |
| Jeskai Miracles | 6% | 25 |
| Ad Nauseam Tendrils | 5% | 21 |
| Sultai Delver | 5% | 21 |
| Other | 48% | 215 |


Only six decks represent more than 50% of the field on Day Two, with the runaway winners being both Blue-Red Delver and Jeskai Stoneblade. Both decks benefit from the push of *Khans of Tarkir* on the format, with Blue-Red Delver adding [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) and [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) to its arsenal of pressure, while Jeskai Stoneblade decks favor the card selection [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) can provide in an instant. It's also the reason Jeskai Miracles found its footing among the top decks, beefed up by better control over the top of its library.



Jeskai Stoneblade is also home to another one of *Magic*'s newest cards, Containment Priest. It's a card custom built to stymie Commander cards like [Genesis Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Wave) but works equally as well against Legacy staples such as [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) and [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack).


Just two of the top decks seem to be ignoring the train of new cards steaming into the format. [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam) Tendrils is one of the go-to ways to kill opponents with style, bypassing attacking with creatures to instead set up an ultimate turn of spells-into-victory on the back of [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual), [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony), and other fast mana and storm spells. Death and Taxes is a deck that builds delays into it's aggressive plays. [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben) turns the efficient spell repertoire common across decks – [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), and others – into slower actions. With [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) and [Rishadan Port](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) to attack opponents mana and [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp) to undo any resistance laid down, the monowhite deck is surprisingly potent in a format where it's often Islands and Mountains as far as the eye and see.


So what about the rest of the decks? Half the format is made up of slices too small to cover in one article. Everything from red [Burn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burn) decks – with and without a splash of blue for [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), the surprisingly less popular option on Day Two – to forgotten gems like [Food Chain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Food+Chain) speak to the diversity of the format. Even summing up all of the Delver and [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) (without any accompanying Delver) decks didn't shift the numbers much:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day 2 Archetypes | Percent | Count |
| Delver (All Types) | 31% | 138 |
| Stoneblade (All Types) | 13% | 56 |
| All Other | 57% | 252 |


However, compared to the counts of undefeated decklist revealed an interested trend to start the day.





|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day 1 Undefeated | Percent | Count |
| Delver (All Types) | 31% | 5 |
| Stoneblade (All Types) | 25% | 4 |
| All Other | 44% | 7 |


[Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) decks had a significant lead in undefeated decks at the expense of the rest of the non-Delver field. Popularity might be the simplest explanation given the small numbers, but it's a suggestive nudge we'll be following as the day progresses.
