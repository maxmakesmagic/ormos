### Kyle Boggemes (Jund) vs. Simon Görtzen (Jund)

After clawing their way through a varied Top 8, both America’s Kyle Boggemes and Simon Görtzen of Germany had their faith in [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) validated. Soon one of them would hoist the trophy as Pro Tour–San Diego Champion.

**Game 1**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptsd10/f_boggemes.jpg)*Kyle Boggemes keeps the U.S. in this Top 8.*Boggemes had to mulligan, and his next six were unspectactular. While Görtzen played a [Savage Lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Lands), [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) for [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax) right on time, Boggemes stumbled with two [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine)s and a [Rootbound Crag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootbound+Crag). Görtzen added a second Thrinax to the mix and hit for 3. Turn four came with no help for Boggemes and he had to pass on his three lands.

Görtzen meanwhile had [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) and set up a lethal [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) for the following turn. Boggemes drew his card and didn’t bother prolonging the inevitable.

Simon Görtzen 1, Kyle Boggemes 0

Both players kept their openers for the second game. This time, Boggemes hit his black mana right on time for a third-turn [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax). Görtzen answered with [Great Sable Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Sable+Stag). Boggemes tapped four and kicked up [Goblin Ruinblaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Ruinblaster), destroying one of Görtzen’s two [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine)s.

Görtzen untapped and replaced it, tapping his other and a [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) for [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech). Boggemes played a land and tapped four for [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), hitting another Ruinblaster and kicking it, knocking off another Ravine. Görtzen played [Savage Lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Lands) and stayed on the defensive.

Boggemes showed him Ruinblaster number three, offing the [Savage Lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Lands). He turned all his men sideways. Görtzen put the Stag in front of one of the Ruinblasters and stopped the Elf his [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech), pumping it to survive. Görtzen fell to 11.

Görtzen untapped and played a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and a second [Great Sable Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Sable+Stag). Boggemes aimed a [Blightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning) at him, catching a land and [Broodmate Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodmate+Dragon). Görtzen’s four land got him a [Master of the Wild Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt), but unfortunately for him Boggemes went one better with a lethal [Broodmate Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodmate+Dragon). Görtzen untapped and tried his luck with [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), but only got a [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax).

Simon Görtzen 1, Kyle Boggemes 1

Boggemes: “How do you like Garruk?”

Görtzen: “I loved him in testing.”

Boggemes: “With [Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) or [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth), it’s a better turn three than Bloodbraid.”

**Game 3**

Görtzen was first on the board with a third-turn Thrinax. Boggemes drew for his third turn and grimaced. He was stuck on two lands, and wound up discarding Garruk. Görtzen piled on with a second Thrinax.

Boggemes’s deck finally yielded a [Verdant Catacombs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs). He fetched a [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and made a Thrinax of his own. Görtzen wasted no time Bolting it and swinging in. Boggemes tripled up to take down one of the Thrinaxes, and his tokens changed sides. Görtzen played a [Great Sable Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Sable+Stag).

Boggemes found no fourth land and ran out another Thrinax. Görtzen charged in with his team, and a post-combat [Blightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning) earned the scoop.

**Game 4**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptsd10/f_goertzen.jpg)*Simon Görtzen of Germany shuffles up for more.*Boggemes mulliganed again for Game 4. He [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed on the second turn and saw Maestrom Pulse sitting alongside [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), [Great Sable Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Sable+Stag), [Master of the Wild Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt) and three lands. While Görtzen played a second [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine), Boggemes played a [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax).

Görtzen answered with the Stag, then had to deal with [Blightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning) from Boggemes. He considered his options, eventually discarding [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech) and [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax). He played his fourth land and the [Master of the Wild Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt).

Boggemes had the second [Blightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning). He emptied Görtzen’s hand of [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) and [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf). Görtzen drew a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and attacked with his [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine). Boggemes blocked with [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax). Boggemes swung back with his own Ravine, taking Görtzen to 10.

Görtzen drew [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), still no help. He sat back on his mana. Boggemes played a land and another [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax). Now they were both playing off the top. Görtzen got a [Great Sable Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Sable+Stag). Boggemes got a [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) but only cascaded into a blank [Mind Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot). His monsters charged. A Stag traded with the the [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) and the other ate a Saproling, and Görtzen fell to 5.

Now it was Görtzen’s turn to spin the Bloodbraid wheel. It landed on [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech). Boggemes activated his [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) and attacked with his two tokens, [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax) and the now 5/5 [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine). Görtzen went into the tank briefly before deciding to put [Great Sable Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Sable+Stag) on [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax), his [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) on a token, and a chump-blocking [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech) on [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine). He fell to 4.

His top card was a replacement [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech). Boggemes considered another attack but instead played yet another [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax). Görtzen drew his card and passed the turn. Boggemes played [Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), then turned on his [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) and attacked all out. Görtzen doubled up on the 6/6 Ravine and caught [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax) with [Great Sable Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Sable+Stag), but that left him at 1 needing to draw a [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) to catch all those tokens. It was not forthcoming.

Simon Görtzen 2, Kyle Boggemes 2

Boggemes: “Well, good luck.”

Görtzen: “Good luck. This is it.”

**Game 5**

Görtzen kicked off the deciding game with [Dragonskull Summit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonskull+Summit), [Verdant Catacombs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs) into [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech). Boggemes passed on two land, then [Terminate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate)d the Leech after it pumped. Simon Görtzen replaced it with [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax).

Boggemes fetched a third land and asked the disheartening question “How many cards in hand?” Görtzen had four, but there was no [Blightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning). Boggemes played a [Great Sable Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Sable+Stag) and passed it back.

Görtzen was ready with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). His other two mana he spent post-attack on [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) for a second forest. He also played a [Lavaclaw Reaches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaclaw+Reaches). Boggemes played [Savage Lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Lands) as his fourth land and passed the turn. Görtzen hit for 3 and cast another [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech).

Boggemes untapped and played his fifth land. He tapped them all and leveled [Bituminous Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bituminous+Blast) at the Leech. He flipped the first card: [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf). He eagerly flipped again. This time the first card was [Sprouting Thrinax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax). Gortezen thought hard at end of turn, and chose to off the Elf with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptsd10/f_board.jpg)*The armies of Jund clash on the battlefield.*Görtzen untapped and offered Boggemes a trade of Thrinaxes. Boggemes accepted. Görtzen doubled his token count with the help of [Siege-Gang Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander). Boggemes answered with [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), making a Beast, and Bolted the [Siege-Gang Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander). Görtzen Bolted the beast token, then attacked Boggemes with his tokens, trading Goblins for Saprolings.

Then Görtzen played the coup de grace: [Blightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning). The damage killed Garruk, and he caught Boggemes’s last two cards: [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and [Broodmate Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodmate+Dragon)!

Boggemes drew and played [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine), then took 6 from an animated [Lavaclaw Reaches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaclaw+Reaches) and the tokens. Boggemes checked his top card, then offered Görtzen a victory handshake.
