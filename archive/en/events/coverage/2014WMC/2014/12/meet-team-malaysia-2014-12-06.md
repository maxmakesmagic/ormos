 It was a normal evening of Friday Night *Magic*.



Players shuffling decks, shaking hands, and hoping for the best from the top of their library. Newbies learning the ropes and grizzled veterans showing them how. Sarkhan and soldiers littered the tables while in another room the Commander games were just getting good.


Then, it all stopped. The room grew quiet.


Team Malaysia was on stream.


"They actually completed paused FNM back home when we got a feature match so they could watch," Joe Soh said. "We definitely didn't expect that."



 Maybe they should have. After all, that's what happens when your country finishes Day One of the World *Magic* Cup at the top of the standings.





*Team Malaysia defeated the juggernaut Team Slovakia to be the sole undefeated team of Day One.*
