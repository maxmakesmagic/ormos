### Game 1


After Currence won the die roll, Derek elected to mulligan, finding his opening hand poor. After drawing six cards, Derek looked at Bryce with a shrug, saying "Guess I'll mulligan again. Come on, deck!" Looking at a five-card hand devoid of land, Derek decided one more mulligan was in order and finally kept a card hand of two Rishidan Ports and two Blazing Specters. Bryce started the game with an Island and Urborg Volcano as Derek drew and played a Volcano himself. Bryce Duressed on turn two to find no legal targets in Lazarski's hand and then watched as Derek played a third land and cast Chimeric Idol. After Bryce played a fourth land and Nether Spirit, Derek cast Flametongue Kavu and with Bryce remembering the Specters, allowed the 4/2 to kill the Spirit before it came back into play during upkeep.


On Bryce's turn, he crippled Derek with Probe, which forced the discarding of the Specters. With the Nether Spirit holding down the fort, the two began trading turns as Bryce built up his hand. Derek, now with 2 Volcanoes, 2 Ports and a Sulfurous Spring in play, Terminated the Spirit, allowing his creatures to get through for a turn, dealing seven damage, taking Bryce to 10.

Bryce cast Fact or Fiction at the end of the turn, netting him two Counterspells and now holding a 6-1 card in hand advantage he tried to gain control, casting Duress only to miss again. Derek drew and cast Urza's Rage, killing the Spirit and attacking for seven again, taking Currence to three. Bryce drew, perused the table and said 'go ahead', and Derek drew and attacked, with the Idol getting through for the final three points of damage, netting the 18 year old the win despite starting down three cards.


### Game 2


With Currence playing first again, both players elected to keep their opening hands. After a first turn Urborg Volcano, Bryce cast Duress on turn two, this time hitting a Chimeric Idol. Derek played a Port on his turn, using it during Bryce's upkeep before casting Duress of his own on the following turn, choosing a Counterspell before again activating the Port on Bryce's upkeep.

Bryce asked for the second time in the match how many cards Derek was holding in hand, and stopped and thought his options over for 30 seconds before relinquishing the turn. Derek attacked and added another Familiar to the fray as Bryce continued his inactive approach.


With the two Familiars beating down, the Port became crucial. With Bryce stopping at five lands, two of them were tapped each turn as the Familiars whittled away his life. Derek Duressed, taking a Counterspell, revealing two Invasion tap lands and two Nether Spirits in the Californian's hand. Bryce finally cast a Spirit, only to have it die to Flametongue Kavu as the Familiars took Bryce to eight. On Derek's next turn, with the Spirit back in play, Derek cast Terminate, having it Undermined before casting another Flametongue, which allowed him to attack for six, taking Bryce to three. A turn later, Lazarski cast Urza's Rage and breathed a sigh of relief, realizing he'd just ended Bryce's streak, qualifying him for US Nationals.


**Final Result:** Lazarski def. Currence, 2-0
