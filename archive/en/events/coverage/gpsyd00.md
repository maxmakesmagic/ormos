| Gordon Lin played his Pandeburst deck expertly to win Grand Prix Sydney! Lin is an architecture student at Auckland University in New Zealand. Many players did not take the Pandeburst deck as a serious threat, but Lin proved them wrong with his 2-1 victory over Will Copeman in the finals. Grand Prix Sydney Champion, Gordon Lin received US$2400 for his first place victory and US$1500 for being the highest finishing player with a DCI Rating Flag of 1700 or less. When Lin was awarded his trophy during the award ceremony, a deafening cheer arose from the dozens of New Zealand players in attendance.
 Grand Prix Sydney was the largest tournament in Australian history, with 194 players. Many players were watching the results of the Grand Prix to research the Extended metagame will be for the Pro Tour Tokyo qualifier season. The event was held in the center of Sydney in conjunction with Magic's all-star game the annual Magic Invitational. |  |
