Sometimes artists integrate connecting themes or ideas across several card illustrations. Christopher Moeller did just that with his renditions of the five white Spheres in *Odyssey*.

Each sphere shows a wizard protecting himself from an attack of a specific color. But what you might not have picked up on was the positioning of the mages' spheres in the art -- they correspond exactly to the positioning of the colored dots on the back of every **Magic** card. For example, [Sphere of Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Truth) protects you from white damage, and the white dot is the topmost one on the cardbacks. So the white sphere in the card's art is in the top center of the illustration.
