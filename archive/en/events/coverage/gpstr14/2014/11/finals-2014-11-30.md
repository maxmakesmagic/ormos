This was it. These two, France's Pierre Dagen and Hungarian Tamás Nagy, had made it further than 1,982 others. They were the last two players in the running for the trophy and, being so close, of course they were fiercely determined to get their hands on it now.


Both had left the final draft table with straightforward clan decks. Dagen was running Abzan, Nagy was bringing an impressive Sultai deck.


Game 1
======



 After a mulligan, Dagen had to wait a bit on his fourth land but fought back valiantly against Nagy's onslaught which began with [Smoke Teller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smoke+Teller) and continued with a stream of morphs.
