Both of these teams have female players and they're paired against each other on Table 5 on the next-to-last round of the tournament.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPYOK01/887.jpg)Apprentice's Nobutoshi Yamazaki opened the first pack, taking an [Urborg Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg+Emissary), giving a [Shivan Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Emissary) to teammate Takahisa Yamaguchi. Poor Shark's Masahiro Kuroda got a [Benalish Heralds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Heralds) as the third card, suggesting a white control deck.


The second *Invasion* pack opened by Apprentice gave Takahisa a [Noble Panther](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Panther) and Masahiro a [Kavu Chameleon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Chameleon), solidifying a potential green-white deck for him, while Takahisa worked on a red-green deck.


Kazumi Kikagawa, Masahiro's eventual opponent drafted red-green, while Masahiko Morita took a [Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Probe) to go with his blue-white deck. Adding an [Agonizing Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agonizing+Demise) on the next pack, he showed that he was willing to add a third color if it meant he got extra power.


The players in the middle both drafted red-black-X decks, with Poor Shark's Tomomi Otsuka adding some green, and Apprentice's Nobutoshi adding some blue.


Very few outright bombs appeared, except for Takahisa's [Verdeloth the Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdeloth+the+Ancient), until the second-to-last *Invasion* pack, which gave Apprentice an [Armadillo Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armadillo+Cloak), a [Breath of Darigaaz](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breath+of+Darigaaz), *and* [Tsabo's Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo%27s+Assassin). The final *Invasion* pack added a [Reckless Spite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Spite) for 2B and a [Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void) for Masahiro, showing that sometimes, it's okay for team members to draft the same colors side-by-side.


When the *Planeshift* section of the draft started, Takahisa took a [Radiant Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Kavu) over [Magma Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Burst), which went to Tomomi. Takahisa continued his multi-color ways when he first-picked a [Questing Phelddagrif](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Questing+Phelddagrif) from a pack that was so strong that the sixth pick was a [Hunting Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Drake). Tomomi, meanwhile got a [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) and a [Shivan Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Wurm) (over a second Magma Burst) from the next two packs, increasing her deck's power enormously. Her luck continued, getting a [Lava Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Zombie) from the last deck opened, a deck where her pick wasn't until fifth.
