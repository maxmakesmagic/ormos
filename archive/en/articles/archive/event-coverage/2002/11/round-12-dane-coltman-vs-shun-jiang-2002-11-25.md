![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmel02/a898.jpg)This is a match between the local lad Jiang (Kangar within Team Heaven) and the near-north invader, Dane from Canberra. It would be a close match-up between BW beats and RG (elves and goblins), with the loser being knocked out of contention for the top 8.

### Game 1

Dane won the coin toss and chose to play. The early game was about each player hoping to not missing land drops. Unfortunately for Jiang, Dane ripped a swamp off the top for a morph to follow-up his second turn [Glory Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker). Jiang cast a morph and they traded creatures, but Dane continued the pressure with a second morph, [Gustcloak Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Skirmisher), [Gluttonous Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Zombie) and [Wretched Anurid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid).

A [Wellwisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) from Jiang only gained him a single life until [Swat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat) finished the wishing.

The evasion abilities of [Gustcloak Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Skirmisher) and [Gluttonous Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Zombie) finished Jiang off in quick time, with [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) making only a quick cameo appearance as a blocker.

Dane wins game 1.

Jiang swaps a [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) for a different [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) from his sideboard in an effort to improve is odds of drawing one . . . an aside here – as there were many [Centaur Glade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Glade) and other troublesome enchantments opened at the draft tables, many players main decked enchantment removal. Dane had no sideboard changes.

### Game 2

Jiang chose to play and both players developed early mana, cycling away land to draw (better) cards. Dane's early morph was thwarted by a [Nosy Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nosy+Goblin), but his next play of [Gravel Slinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravel+Slinger) was looking good against an army of elves and goblins. Jiang had the answer – [Embermage Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermage+Goblin), fetching a second to be a partner in crime. Daunting Defender and [Daru Lancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Lancer) were looking good, until Jiang cast the second Embermage, fetching a third! Three Embermage did bad things to Dane's creatures, especially when combined with [Solar Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Blast) for more removal.

Dane seemed to be very aware of his life total (still 17 at this stage) so he played a [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) first, followed by a [Wretched Anurid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid) – the husk was poked by two Embermages in response, forcing Dane to sacrifice his [Gravel Slinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravel+Slinger), just to save a point of life.

From this point it was simply a matter of Jiang casting chump blockers for the attacking [Daunting Defender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender) – the combination of Dane's own [Wretched Anurid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid) and the three Embermage ended things quickly.

Jiang wins – 1 game all.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmel02/a899.jpg)Jiang added his second [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) for [Explosive Vegetation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Vegetation); Dane makes no changes.

### Game 3

Dane takes a mulligan, and both players cycle cards – Jiang a [Tranquil Thicket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tranquil+Thicket) and Dane an [Akroma's Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Blessing) to improve their hands once again. Dane opens strongly with [Glory Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) and [Wretched Anurid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid) to apply early pressure. [Wellwisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) and [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) hold things steady for Jiang, however the beats continue from Dane, who ripped [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) off the top for a [Wirewood Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Elf) enchanted by Cloak of Vigor that held things a bay for a turn. Jiang went as low as 8 life before more elves arrived to counteract the beating he was taking.

A [Krosan Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker) off the top looked bad for Dane, and he simply said done in his own turn, allowing Jiang to force some creature damage through. Sadly for the Tusker, Dane had a combat trick – a second [Akroma's Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Blessing) allowing his group block to survive, and the Tusker went away. [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) came and went without being of any use except blocking and Jiang went down to 5 life.

Then things turned.

[Wellwisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) #2 arrived, followed by #3 the next turn - however #3 was met by a [Crown of Suspicion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Suspicion) to stop things being completely silly. Thanks to the two [Wellwisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher), Jiang's life steadily rose even with the beating he was taking, and once he ripped his first [Embermage Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermage+Goblin), it was simply a matter of having enough mana to cast them quickly. Dane's life total, which was already at 9 life from [Wretched Anurid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid) disappeared in three quick pokes from the goblins.

**Final Result:** Jiang 2 - Coltman 1

Jiang wins and breathes a sigh of relief after looking bad early, with congratulations coming from his fellow team mates.
