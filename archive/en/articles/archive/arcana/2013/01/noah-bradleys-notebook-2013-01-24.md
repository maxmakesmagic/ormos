We've done a lot of Arcanas showing the sketches that artists send to the **Magic** Creative Team before working on the finished card art. And it's neat to see the artistic process in action.


But the truth is that these sketches usually aren't the first thing the artist works on. They're just the thing that they've sent in for approval. To demonstrate this, artist Noah Bradley has kindly shared a few pictures of the notebook (one of which may have been previous seen [on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/15yd1i/boros_guildgate_from_start_to_finish/), which is where the idea for this Arcana came from) where he does a *lot* of preliminary sketches before getting to the stage we've been calling "sketches." Let's look!


### Giant Growth and Mizzium Mortars
