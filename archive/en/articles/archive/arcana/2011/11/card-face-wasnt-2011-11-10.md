Hey, wanna see something neat? Check out this page from the May, 2000 issue of *Topdeck* Magazine, featuring something we didn't end up doing. (Just to be clear: this is an eleven-year-old article, describing something that didn't happen.)

Yes, back in 2000, the **Magic** card face almost changed. And then it didn't! But elements from this card face ended up in the modern card face, which first appeared in *Eighth Edition* in July 2003. And the idea of having vertical mana costs on the left, to make them easier to see when the cards are fanned? That showed up in the *Future Sight* "futureshifted" cards in May 2007. R&D never throws away an idea!

And ideas aren't the only things R&D never throws away! So even if you knew all that, here's something you've never seen before. From the playtest card archives of the Arcana Vaults and Mark Rosewater's Desk, a few of the cards R&D actually played with when testing out that theoretical card face!
