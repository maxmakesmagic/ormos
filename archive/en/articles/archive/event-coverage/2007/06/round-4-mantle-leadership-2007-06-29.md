In one of the biggest powerhouse matchups yet, Masashi Oiso and Rogier Maaten faced off against Jon Finkel and Josh Ravitz. The Japanese and Dutch **Magic** pros have grown close in the last few years, communicating through MTGO and various instant messengers. Maaten added, "If I need a deck for a Grand Prix, I just IM Kenji." A lot of **Magic** players would love to be able to say that. 


Both teams were undefeated. Oiso was playing black-green splashing white with Maaten finishing off the color pie with red-blue. Ravitz brought white-green, and Finkel played a red-black-blue deck with tons of discard enablers including 2 [Looter il-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor), [Bonded Fetch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Fetch), [Lightning Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe), [Trespasser il-Vec](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trespasser+il-Vec), and Urborg Syphon Mage, combined with lots of madness cards including triple [Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptsdg07/R4_Finkel_Maaten_Oiso_Ravitz.jpg)*Unlikely duo Masashi Oiso and Rogier Maaten square off against blasts from the past and fellow undefeateds Jon Finkel and Josh Ravitz.*Oiso free-mulliganned then mulliganned twice more down to five. Finkel and Ravitz both free-mulliganned, then Finkel threw back a seven-card hand of "[Lightning Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe), [Dead // Gone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+%2F%2F+Gone), [Rathi Trapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Trapper), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)." The hand would be pretty reasonable in a single-player draft, but this format's decks will tend to be more powerful than "normal" draft decks, and require a higher standard. The hand also lacked the madness-discard interactions of which the deck is capable.


The Americans won the toss and opened it up with [Mire Boa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Boa) and [Looter il-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor). Oiso answered with [Deathspore Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathspore+Thallid), which could kill them both if it just gets enough time.


Ravitz adds [Saltfield Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltfield+Recluse) while Finkel made another discard enabler in [Bonded Fetch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Fetch). While the [Mire Boa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Boa)'s regen shields were down, Maaten cut off its life with [Orcish Cannonade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Cannonade), sending his own team to 24 life. Oiso added [Hedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedge+Troll), but had only [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s and [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s so far, making the [Hedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedge+Troll) merely a Headless Horseman.


Right on schedule on turn four, Ravitz kicked up a [Thornscape Battlemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Battlemage). He faced a choice that paused the team: kill [Hedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedge+Troll) while it was still small, or kill [Deathspore Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathspore+Thallid) while it still had just one counter? A brief conference, and [Deathspore Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathspore+Thallid) suffered the Thorny fire. Meanwhile, Finkel looted out a [Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler) to return a previously looted creature, then played [Dream Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Stalker) to return the [Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler), ready to run it all again. 


Maaten made a morph, while Oiso could only sit back on the mana ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif), making his opponents wonder about [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption), [Sudden Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Death) or some sort of flash character.


The Americans sent the [Looter il-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor) and [Thornscape Battlemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Battlemage) in again for damage. ([Hedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedge+Troll) was scared of blocking because of Ravitz' [Saltfield Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltfield+Recluse).) Using the Looter's madness, Finkel re-upped on the [Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler) that he returned with [Dream Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Stalker), this time targeting his *teammate's*
[Mire Boa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Boa), because [Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler)'s template isn't quite like gravedigger's. In fact, [Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler)'s "futuristic ability in the future frame of *Future Sight*" template allows you to return a creature from *any* graveyard to its owner's hand-a very Two-Headed-friendly functionality. [Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler)'s version of the classic [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) ability isn't in "current-time" **Magic** quite yet, but look for R&D to explore increasing numbers of 2HG-friendly templates in the years to come. Finkel finished by adding Urborg Syphon Mage, benefiting from the reduced cost of [Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler)'s madness option.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptsdg07/R4_Finkel_Ravitz.jpg)*Go go Grave Scrabbler!*Maaten (with ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) and a facedown morph) and Oiso (with ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) and a [Hedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedge+Troll)) both played nothing, but they had some instant surprises in store. I couldn't resist and went around to look at Oiso's hand: [Strength in Numbers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+in+Numbers), [Sunlance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunlance), [Big Game Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Big+Game+Hunter), and [Viscid Lemures](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscid+Lemures). Two uncastables, and two "wait for the right targets." Maaten was holding back all kinds of gas: [Ovinize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ovinize), [Erratic Mutation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Mutation), [Aquamorph Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity), [Aether Membrane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Membrane), and [Fomori Nomad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fomori+Nomad).


On turn six, all hell broke loose. [Looter il-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor), [Thornscape Battlemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Battlemage), and [Mire Boa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Boa) with [Saltfield Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltfield+Recluse) backup all attacked into the Oiso/Maaten team of unpumped [Hedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedge+Troll), facedown morph, and nine crucial untapped lands. Maaten blocked Battlemage with his morph and troll. He flipped up [Fledgling Mawcor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fledgling+Mawcor), pinging the attacking Looter. putting Oiso/Maaten up one card. Despite the Recluse, that Battlemage would still die to the double block, trading one-for-one. Then Maaten played [Erratic Mutation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Mutation) to kill the attacking [Mire Boa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Boa), while Oiso pitched in with Strength of Numbers to save the blocking Mawcor. Amidst all the bloodshed, the Japanese-Dutch team was still up a card on the turn. But then Finkel used [Bonded Fetch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Fetch) to madness out (+1 card) a *second*
[Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler), bringing back Ravitz's [Thornscape Battlemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Battlemage) (+1 card), which came into play with kicker killing the Mawcor after all (+1 card) In seconds, Oiso and Maaten had gone from +1 card advantage on the turn to a savage -2. 


Determined to find a way back, Oiso topdecked a land and his team took it up a notch with [Viscid Lemures](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscid+Lemures) and [Fomori Nomad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fomori+Nomad). At end of turn, Finkel drained for 4 life life with a 2HG-pumped [Urborg Syphon-Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg+Syphon-Mage), again benefiting from the reduced mana cost of madness-[Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler). This took the Americans to 34, with the Japanese-Dutch at 14.


Smelling blood in the water, Finkel pitched [Lightning Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe) and [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) to take out [Fomori Nomad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fomori+Nomad), and sent a suicide squad ([Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler), [Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler), [Thornscape Battlemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Battlemage), and [Dream Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Stalker)) into the larger [Hedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedge+Troll) and [Viscid Lemures](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscid+Lemures) just to hammer the opponents' life total and bring them into Syphon-Mage range. The Japanese-Dutch team fell to 10. Ravitz kept the pressure on with [Llanowar Empath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Empath), fishing up and playing [Magus of the Library](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Library). The 6 plays of comes-into-play creatures on the Finkel-Ravitz side had been totally devastating.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptsdg07/R4_Maaten_Oiso.jpg)*Rogier plays straight man as Oiso cuts up.*Maaten and Oiso finally choked off the discard outlets with Oiso's [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and [Sunlance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunlance) on the Syphon-Mage, while Maaten played snuck a [Leaden Fists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Fists) onto the [Bonded Fetch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Fetch) when it tapped. The Syphon-Mage spellshaped another 4 life on the way out, taking the score to 6-38. But with a 1/5 [Aquamorph Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity), and all the draining stopped, Oiso and Maaten seemed to have stabilized.


Turn 8: Finkel found a [Trespasser il-Vec](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trespasser+il-Vec) and discarded on the following turn to give it shadow, but [Ovinize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ovinize) brought it back to the real world, where it found a welcoming committee of triple blockers. [Dawn Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Charm) saved the Trespasser's brutish life for a few short seconds, but a nasty [Ghostfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostfire) finished it off.


With Trespasser halted, Ravitz went with another "discard for damage" creature: *Prophecy* stowaway Jolrael, Empress of Beasts. Up against the wall, Maaten flipped [Shaper Parasite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite), to give Jolrael +2/-2, but did it for the power change rather than the toughness-the pump opened the door for Oiso finally to play [Big Game Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Big+Game+Hunter), comboing Jolrael off the table.


Oiso knew his team couldn't fight off these offensive weapons forever, and he swampwalked his [Viscid Lemures](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscid+Lemures) in for a point past [Saltfield Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltfield+Recluse). Ravitz continued the *Onslaught* with another chunky offensive threat: [Lucent Liminid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lucent+Liminid).


At 6 life and desperate to stay undefeated, Maaten *again* came up with an answer: [Aether Membrane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Membrane) to block [Lucent Liminid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lucent+Liminid). But it was then that [Lucent Liminid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lucent+Liminid) took charge of the situation by donning the oft-scoffed at [Mantle of Leadership](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantle+of+Leadership). [Bonded Fetch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Fetch) and [Stingscourger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingscourger) appeared to pump the Liminid up to 7 power, and [Stingscourger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingscourger) bounced the [Aether Membrane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Membrane) to clear the way for the flying enchantment's final assault.


Jon Finkel/Josh Ravitz, now 4-0, defeat Masashi Oiso/Rogier Maaten.
