[![Lorwyn release events are this weekend at a store near you.](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/tournamentcenter/2007/lorwyn_300.jpg)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases)We wanted to make sure you knew that [*Lorwyn* release events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases) are this *weekend* at a store near you. Furthermore, [*Lorwyn* release events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases) are *this* weekend at a *store* near you. In summary, [*Lorwyn release events*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases) are this weekend at a store *near you*. 


To celebrate, this week we're showing off some of the TV spots we've been running on Comedy Central and Adult Swim. Most of them are irreverent and funny jabs at the *Lorwyn* tribes combined with our usual "call to action" to go to the release events. (The video quality is the best we could get out of YouTubeâ€”if you want to see them in better resolution, you might set your TiVo to try to pull them down off the airwaves.) Anyway, check them out!
