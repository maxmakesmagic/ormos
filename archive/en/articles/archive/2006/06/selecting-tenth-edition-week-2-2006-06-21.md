In the meantime, we've got the results from the first basic land art vote as well as [Hurricane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurricane) vs. [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake). First off, here's how the first card vs. card vote came out.

> 
> I am happy you guys agreed with me and voted in [Hurricane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurricane) over [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake). Aaron says it isn't related to [Hurricane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurricane) winning, but since he found out it won he has made me clean his desk, wash his car and call his Dad last Sunday. I'm always happy to help out!
> 
> 
> This week we are debating [Auriok Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Champion) and [Paladin en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paladin+en-Vec). They are obviously similar in many ways, but in almost all cases the Paladin is better at doing what each card wants to do.
> 
> 
> The biggest advantage the Paladin has is two power. Two power means you will be killing your opponent's creatures instead of just blocking and preventing damage. It also means that if the black or red player gets low you can go on the offensive and get the kill much faster than the champion could.
> 
> 
> The only advantage [Auriok Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Champion) has is his life gain. That doesn't help much because white has many cards that will just give you more life. These reasons are why [Auriok Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Champion) saw very limited play in tournaments and why [Paladin en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paladin+en-Vec) has been in many decks recently.

*Comments from Aaron Forsythe*



> 
> [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) lost. I’m not very good at this, am I?
> 
> 
> Okay, moving right along. My card this week is The Hotness, aka [Auriok Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Champion). Talk about the total package! Life gain, protection from two colors, and a low mana cost. What’s not to love?
> 
> 
> I’m sure many of you may be hesitant to vote your new old pal [Paladin en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paladin+en-Vec) off the island; after all, the Paladin is getting heavy play right now in Standard. Well, guess what—[Umezawa’s Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%E2%80%99s+Jitte) isn’t going to be around forever, which is the Paladin’s whole reason for showing up. (As mastermind deckbuilder Tsuyoshi Fujita once said, “[Paladin en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paladin+en-Vec) and Jitte: Best Combo in Standard.”)
> 
> 
> Without the Jitte around, you want your double-pro creature to help keep you alive—and the Champion does that so much better than the Paladin. What are black and red decks more afraid of, an indestructible [Soul Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden), or an indestructible, uh, [Phantom Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Warrior)?
> 
> 
> Choose life. Choose [Auriok Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Champion).
