The cycle of five Guildmages from *Mirage* underwent a lot of changes from design to development to finished product. Each was a 1/1 creature for one colored mana. Each had two abilities that each required an allied color and a tap. And the ability of each color was the same on both cards on which it appeared.

 But what the abilities themselves were, and what the Guildmages' names ended up being, did not start out the way they are now. Can you recall what their abilities are now? Can you remember their final names? (Click on each card image below to see its final version.)
