It was 10am the day \*before\* the Grand Prix began and there was already hundreds of people waiting and trading in the halls of the Miyako Messe - the convention centre site of this Kyoto event. The players were here to fight for the coveted three byes that will greatly increase their chances of making second day this weekend. Over 200 people started the first round of the Grand Prix Trial at 11:00 Friday morning! Keita Mori, the Sideboard's Japanese staff writer went through the decklists and provided the following archetype breakdown:



 **Mono Red (Sligh, Burn, Ponza) 34
  
NecroDonate 19
  
Tradewind Survival 18
  
White Weenie 17
  
Countersliver 15
  
Replenish 13
  
CounterOath 13
  
Draw-Go 12
  
Stompy 9
  
Stasis 7
  
Fish 6
   
UGW Control 3
  
Black Weenie 3
  
Secret Force 3
  
Counter Phoenix 3
  
Black Control 3**





And approximately 30 "Extreme" Decks - rogue decks such as the two Pox decks as well as standard decks that have been "morphed" into Extended decks such as Trinity, Angry Hermit and Tinker.





As is typical with Grand Prix trials, the decks tend to be aggressive and/or inexpensive. Many of the players who have the expensive and difficult to play decks already have byes. Several top players are playing in the trial but rumor has it that they're just playing for fun, as they want to save their best decks for the Grand Prix itself.
