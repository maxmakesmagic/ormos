DAY 1 COVERAGE



Welcome to the Czech Republic's capital of Prague, where this weekend players from all over Europe and beyond have gathered to test their mettle in Legacy!


With this event and another Legacy Grand Prix in Columbus at the same time, this weekend will surely present a lot of answers to the most pressing questions of the format: Can the Eldrazi be stopped? Which version of the blue tempo deck with Delver of Secrets is the best nowadays? What's up with Shardless Sultai? Is Storm still the combo deck of choice? Is Sneak and Show? And can anything really beat Miracles reliably?


With the 2015–2016 Pro Season nearing its conclusion, many of the world's best and brightest are in attendance this weekend. On their quest for Pro Points to reach levels in the Pro Players Club and to earn an invite to the World Championship and the World *Magic* Cup, they'll have to solve the ongoing metagame puzzle of the format. We'll watch them closely, and so can you. Tune in to our live video coverage and get all the latest straight from the battlefield of Grand Prix Prague 2016!

As is tradition, Friday gave players their last chance to earn byes for today's main event: by going 5-0 in a 32-player single-elimination Grand Prix Trial. Their last chance and our first, that...
