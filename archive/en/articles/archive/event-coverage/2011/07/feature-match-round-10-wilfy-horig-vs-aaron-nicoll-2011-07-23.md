Coming out of the draft rounds, both Aaron Nicoll and Wilfy Horig were sitting on top of the standings each with 5-1 in draft, and 3-0 in constructed. Horig's Vampire deck stumbled in Game 1, missing a pair of land drops before drawing into lands than entered the battlefield tapped. This gave Nicoll's three-color [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) deck room to set up the kill, by using [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) to fetch out [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), and then [Urabrask the Hidden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urabrask+the+Hidden), letting the Splinter'd Exarch copies attack immediately.

Game 2 was even worse for Horig, as Nicoll had an early [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm), and then a pair of [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum)'s to continue slowing him down. Nicoll mopped up the mess with a [Frost Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan).
