It's a quiet week here at the home of the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings. And that's good, because if you listen very carefully, you might just hear the feverish scratchings of pen on paper, the whisper of cards being sleeved up, and the incessant tapping of keyboards deep into the night. The biggest names in the game have mostly gone into seclusion with their nearest and dearest (also known as their teammates) to work day and night on the Modern format for Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*, now just over two weeks away. 

 Every Pro Tour demands rigorous testing, but the banning of [Deathrite Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman), coupled with the *un*banning of both [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) and [Wild Nacatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl), have opened up the possibility of a seismic shift in the Modern metagame. Hence the scratchings, whispers, and tapping. 

 That's not to say that the Pro Tour is the only game in town—far from it. Over the next six weeks, there's a veritable blizzard of **Magic** coming to screens near you. Grand Prix Paris serves as a white-hot "warm up" event for the Pro Tour, featuring up to 2,000 players choosing from every card under the sun in the Legacy format. For those of a Limited persuasion, Grand Prix Mexico City provides a *Theros*-based alternative. Many of the Pros will stay in Spain after Valencia, ready for the much-anticipated Team Sealed event at Grand Prix Barcelona, while Antipodeans get their first taste of live video coverage from a home Grand Prix in Melbourne. Grand Prix Richmond rounds out the season, allowing all comers to take a stab at the brand-new Modern metagame. 

This week, the rankings don't change. Next week, the rankings don't change. Then watch out—it's going to be carnage.
