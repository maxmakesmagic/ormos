In **Magic** "shorthand," letters often refer to mana symbols. For example, if a person says "R," he often means ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif). Similarly, "XWB" really means ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif).


I guess someone forgot to tell that to the people that typeset *Alpha*. Look at the two cards below – [Phantasmal Forces](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Forces) and [Force of Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Nature). See anything weird in the text boxes?


I know [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s tap for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif), but what taps for "G"? As with most errors in *Alpha*, these were fixed in *Beta*.


Oh, and artist Douglas Shuler's name is misspelled on the Force.
