It's coming! The home stretch of the 2013–2014 *Magic* season is upon us, and it all comes to a close at the Portland Expo Center in Portland, Oregon, with Pro Tour *Magic 2015* at the end of the month.


Witness the culmination of what has been a stellar season of Magic on August 1–3, as players seek to lock up their slots at the World Championship this December; earn those last remaining Pro Points to achieve greatness in the [Pro Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines); and, of course, battle for the title of Pro Tour Magic 2015 Champion.


With one of the closest [Player of the Year races](”) we've seen in years between No. 1-ranked player Reid Duke and No. 2-ranked player Jérémy Dezani, Pro Tour *Magic 2015* is sure to be a spectacle for *Magic* lovers everywhere. And if you're in the area, you can come watch the events of the 2013–2014 season unfold in person!


Spectator Hall Hours



The tournament hall opens to spectators on Friday and Saturday at 8 a.m., and remains open until 8 p.m. that night. Watch your favorite players battle it out at the Pro Tour. The hall will be set up to accommodate spectators, allowing you to view most matches of *Magic* in progress each round.



On Sunday, the feature match area may be closed off, but you can watch the Top 8 battle it out on the official Pro Tour *Magic 2015* stream on the big screen, as a projector and seating will allow you to watch *Magic* at its biggest and best. The hall is open Sunday, from 8:30 a.m. until 7 p.m. Stop by, watch some *Magic*, and you may just have the chance to cheer for the game-changing plays alongside game's greatest!
