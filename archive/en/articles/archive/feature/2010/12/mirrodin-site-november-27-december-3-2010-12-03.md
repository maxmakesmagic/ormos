Welcome back to "On the Mirrodin Site," where we show off some of the recent highlights from the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/).

We'll start with the Mirrans this time, as that's where most of the action has been. There's wallpaper for [Hero of Bladehold](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#plains,hotspots;W7;0;), [Titan Forge](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#mountains,hotspots;R12;0;), and [Contested War Zone](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#plains,hotspots;W10;0;), all of which are cards that haven't been seen yet. And the Phyrexian side has preview art for [Consecrated Sphinx](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#islands,hotspots;U10;0;).

Finally, Ria of Bladehold has a new [Field Report](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#!blog,816). Keep watching the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/) for updates!
