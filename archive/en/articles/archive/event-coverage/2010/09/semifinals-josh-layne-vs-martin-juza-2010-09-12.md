One of Europe's top players, Martin Juza entered the Semifinals of Grand Prix-Portland having already taken down superstar Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa of Brazil in the Quarterfinals. His opponent, Josh Layne, had a slimmer resume than Juza but his quiet and professional demeanor hinted at a skill set stronger than his resume would led one to believe.

**Game 1**


A [War Priest of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Priest+of+Thune) hit the battlefield for Josh Layne on the second turn, though it didn't have any enchantments to blow up. Before he could attack with the 2/2, however, Martin shut him down with a [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief). The following turn [Alluring Siren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren) hit for Juza, potentially threatening to clear the way for his 1/3 card drawing engine. Layne fired back with an [Assault Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin), but the 3/2 was matched by [Azure Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake) from his opponent.


Josh took his turn and was required to attack with his [Assault Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin) by his opponent's [Alluring Siren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren). When Martin blocked the 3/2 flyer with his 2/4 flyer, Layne saved his creature with [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth). He cast [Cloud Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader), but Juza had a second [Azure Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake) to make attacking difficult yet again for Josh. The second 2/4 finally got the job done against the [Assault Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin) with help from the Siren, but Josh was ready to start deploying his big guns, casting [Yavimaya Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Wurm) post-combat.


The 6/4 Wurm was the least of Juza's worries, however, as his opponent cast a pre-combat [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane) and promptly gave each of his creatures +1/+1. A [Rotting Legion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotting+Legion) gave Juza a fatty, but with his opponent's team super sized *and* given vigilance it wasn't looking very good for the Czech pro. He used [Sign in Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood) on himself to dig for more options and came up with [Cloud Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Elemental). The 2/3 wasn't much help against the Ajani, but Martin was technically still in things.


[Awakener Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid) for Josh changed that abruptly giving him a gigantic surprise attacker as it animated one of his [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s, then Ajani pumped his team a second time and sent a horde of attackers to the red zone. When the combat step ended, Juza had an [Azure Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake) and [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief) while Josh had a 4/5 [Cloud Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader), a 4/4 [War Priest of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Priest+of+Thune), a 5/6 [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and a 2/2 [Awakener Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid) (not to mention an [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane) with two loyalty counters!). Did Martin have anything he could draw in his deck to get him out of the sticky situation?

[Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) was a start, taking out the [Cloud Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader) and allowing him to attack Ajani to death with [Azure Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake). He also cast [Maritime Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maritime+Guard) and [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night), but was still facing down the War Priest and [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). The Priest died to a double-block, but Josh reloaded with [Cudgel Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cudgel+Troll) and passed the turn with Martin on just 4 life. Juza drew for the turn, finding a land on top of his library, and considered his options. He cast [Call to Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) to get back [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), then used the removal spell on [Cudgel Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cudgel+Troll).


Josh continued pressing in, earning a chump block on his [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) from [Maritime Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maritime+Guard) before casting [Wild Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Griffin) and then two [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). Martin used Ã†ther Adept to bounce his opponent's [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), his [Azure Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake) holding the fort against his opponent's Griffin. When he cast [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) a turn later, it looked like the European player had stabilized!


[Armored Cancrix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Cancrix) and [Augury Owl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl) further developed Martin's side of the battlefield and the game began turning to his favor as he freed up enough space to swing with his 2/4 Drake. When he cast a [Conundrum Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conundrum+Sphinx) while Layne drew land after land, it seemed over! A few attacks later, and it was with Martin's [Conundrum Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conundrum+Sphinx) allowing him to overwhelm his opponent despite Layne's far more aggressive start; Josh's deck just couldn't hold on until the end to seal the deal and Juza had managed an amazing comeback!

**Game 2**


The second game started poorly for Josh who had to take a mulligan, but he was able to aggressively pressure Martin very quickly. He opened on [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) before casting an [Awakener Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid) to animate his lone [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). Juza cast an [Alluring Siren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren) and [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night), but had little going for him beyond the fact Layne was a touch mana screwed, sitting on two lands and his Elf. The [Alluring Siren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren) attempted to run [Awakener Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid) into [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) but Josh had [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) to protect it, keeping his 4/5 [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) alive.


To replace his [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) Juza cast [Azure Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake) and combined with [Alluring Siren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren) he was able to take out the [Awakener Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid) and simultaneously deal with his opponent's [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), though he took 4 in the process. [Cloud Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Elemental) joined Martin's team, but he lost his [Azure Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake) to [Plummet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet) and his [Alluring Siren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren) to a block on [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). The good news was he had a full grip after casting [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) while his opponent was stuck on three mana. Of course, that was bad news for said opponent, and Josh worked to come up with a way out of the game that had seen him short on mana.

[Armored Cancrix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Cancrix) for Martin followed by [Sign in Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood) gave him more cards and more pressure while Josh's deck continued to fail in finding him additional lands to use in casting the spells in his hand. A [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) for Martin almost assuredly spelled Josh's end, but he pressed on, hoping to draw a miracle.


It wasn't to be, however, as a [Midnight Banshee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Banshee) pushed Martin's lead too far and he managed to knock out his second player in the Top 8.
