**![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gpsj17/t8_hausman.jpg)Name:** Ari Hausman-Cohen


**Age:** 23


**Hometown:** Sunnyvale, California


**Occupation:** Software Engineer


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** 4-0’d an *Aether Revolt* pre-release; Day 1’d 2 Grand Prix (Sane Jose & Vegas 2015)


**What colors did you play in Sealed Deck on Day 1? What cards most impressed you?**


Grixis. [Aether Chaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Chaser)/[Aether Poisoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Poisoner) did serious work enabling +3/+4 improvise plays. I underestimated them; it took me until round 6 to realize I was an aggro deck.


**What colors did you play in the first Draft of Day 2? What cards most impressed you?**


Black-Green. Two [Ridgescale Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ridgescale+Tusker) and a [Verdurous Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdurous+Gearhulk) is pretty great.


**What colors did you play in the second Draft of Day 2? What cards most impressed you?**


Green-Blue Energy. Larger than Life was pivotal in winning at least one game each round. [Untethered Express](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Untethered+Express) was good—surprising no one.


**What is your favorite Limited rare, uncommon, and common in *Aether Revolt*? Why?**


Rare: Aetherspeher Harvester


Uncommon: [Untethered Express](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Untethered+Express)


Common: [Aether Poisoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Poisoner)


*Aether Revolt*'s Uncommon-and-up vehicles do work!


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**


Guess I’m better/luckier than I thought.
