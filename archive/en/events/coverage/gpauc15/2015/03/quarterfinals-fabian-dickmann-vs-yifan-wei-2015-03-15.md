Fabian Dickmann's aggressive Jeskai deck was up against the slower Sultai deck from Yifan Wei. Dickmann summoned a turn two Frost Walker, which Wei immediately targeted with a Debilitating Injury. Dickmann cast a [Dragon Bell Monk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Bell+Monk), which Wei Scouted the Borders. Wei then went for a big play, using Delve to cast an early [Necropolis Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropolis+Fiend).


Dickmann casually used [Smite the Monstrous](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smite+the+Monstrous) to slay the demon and continue his assault. A few turns later, Dickmann cleared Wei's [Unyielding Krumar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unyielding+Krumar) with a [Feat of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feat+of+Resistance). Wei, in trouble, cast a [Rakshasa's Secret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa%27s+Secret) to knock the last cards from Dickmannâ€™s hand, then played a lonely tapped [Mardu Skullhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Skullhunter).

Wei had a plan, however. Though down to five life, he used the Skullhunter to trigger raid in order to cast a [Bellowing Saddelbrute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bellowing+Saddelbrute) without taking life loss. It was not enough, though, as Yifan hoarded enough cards to finish Yifan off with [Master the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+the+Way) for exact damage.



**Dickmann 1 - Wei 0**



Dickmann was off to a much slower start Game 2, while Wei ensured he'd make his land drops by summoning an [Ainok Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Guide), searching for a plains. Dickmann floundered, while Wei ran out a [Mardu Skullhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Skullhunter), [Bellowing Saddelbrute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bellowing+Saddelbrute), and a [Rotting Mastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotting+Mastodon).


Dickmann tried to rally with a [Jeskai Student](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Student) and a [Sandsteppe Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandsteppe+Outcast), but a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) from Wei pushed Dickmann too far behind, and Dickmann conceded.



**Dickmann 1 - Wei 1**



Game 3, and both players chose to keep their grip of seven cards. Once again Dickmann found a Turn 2 [Frost Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Walker).


"No [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury)!" joked Dickmann, putting his hands over the Walker. Wei pulled a face, but merely plated an [Ainok Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Guide) as a 2/2 and passed the turn.


Dickmann cast a [Crippling Chill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Chill) on the Ainok and smashed in for four damage. Wei had no further response on Turn 3, so the [Frost Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Walker) went into the red zone again, and then was joined by a [Dragon Bell Monk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Bell+Monk). Wei summoned [Alesha's Vanguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alesha%27s+Vanguard), hoping to stop the Walker.

Dickmann asked to speak to a judge. After confirming the rules, he played an [Elite Scaleguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Scaleguard) to bolster the [Frost Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Walker). As bolster doesn't target, the [Frost Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Walker) became a 7/3. It attacked, tapping down the [Alesha's Vanguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alesha%27s+Vanguard). Wei, on 12 life, was reluctant to go down to 5 life, and chump blocked the [Frost Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Walker) with the [Ainok Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Guide).


Wei cast a [Unyielding Krumar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unyielding+Krumar), hoping to stem the tide. However Dickmann found a [Singing Bell Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Singing+Bell+Strike), tapping it down. The ability of the [Elite Scaleguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Scaleguard) tapped down Wei's second blocker, and Wei found himself on 1 life. With his blockers useless, and no way to recover, Wei conceded.
