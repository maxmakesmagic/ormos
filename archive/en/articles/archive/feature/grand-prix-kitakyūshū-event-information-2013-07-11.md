The city center dates back centuries to when it was a castle town known as Kokura, which guarded the Straits of Shimonoseki between Honshū and Kyūshū. Although known to gourmets as the city where [*yakiudon*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaki_udon) was created, Kitakyūshū is perhaps best known to fans of history due to its proximity to Ganryū-jima, the locale of the famous sword battle between the legendary Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojirō. This is the fourth Grand Prix to be held in Kitakyūshū and the sixth in Kyūshū. 

  

 *The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#2013).*

 Players must have a signed publicity and consent form to be included in Wizards of the Coast's official online event coverage and be eligible to receive prizes. Forms can be [downloaded here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/Consent_form_2013_Magic.pdf) (100k PDF) and will be available onsite. Minors must have a parent or guardian's signature on this form. Consent forms are usually collected during registration (contact the event organizer for details). 


**Tournament Format**
  


* [Standard](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrstandard)
* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day 2 that they used on Day 1.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).


**Judges**
  
 The Head Judge for Grand Prix Kitakyūshū will be Riccardo Tessitori (Level 5, Italy). 



**Notes**
  


* [Planeswalker Points](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/Information) multiplier 8x, Rules Enforcement Level (REL) is Competitive on Day 1 and Professional on Day 2.

Rules documents can be found in the [**Magic** Document Center](http://www.wizards.com/wpn/Events/Rules.aspx?category=magic:thegathering) .
* Players are responsible for bringing their own method of tracking life totals, card sleeves, and appropriate counters or tokens.
* In the event that a player who wins an invitation to a Pro Tour stop at a Grand Prix has already qualified for an invitation, the invitation does not pass down under any circumstances. Previous qualification may be through a Qualifier tournament, through performance at a professional tournament, or by being an invited DCI player (valid upon the date of the official rank announcement for the appropriate professional tournament).

### Artist Information

Winona Nelson, Yeong-hao Han, and Vincent Proce will be in attendance.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpkit13/WinonaNelson300.jpg)
**Winona Nelson**
  
 Winona Nelson was born in Wisconsin in 1983 and grew up in Duluth, Minnesota. With an abstract painter for a mother and a wildlife artist father, she was born into art and started drawing before she could walk. She found inspiration in science fiction and fantasy movies, books, comics, video games, and her older brother's **Magic** cards. She was trained in classical realism at the Safehouse Atelier in San Francisco, then worked as a concept artist and character designer in Bay Area game studios. After dreaming about it since her teen years, she began illustrating for **Magic: the Gathering** with the *Innistrad* set. Winona now lives and works in Philadelphia with her artist beau Anthony Palumbo and their bad cat, Diego.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpkit13/YeongHaoHan300.jpg)
**Yeong-hao Han**
  
 Yeong Hao Han's youth involved playing video games and drawing. You could compare his life to that of a hermit. He didn't get out a whole lot, ended up going to art school, and then drew a whole lot more. After graduating, Yeong Hao ended up getting a job doing concept art and design for video games on titles like Mercenaries 2 and Project Offset.   
  
 More recently, he started up a studio with a friend making mobile games. His time now gets split evenly between painting and game design. The company has since shipped two titles, the zombie game Brainsss and a free puzzle game called Blendoku for iOS and Android.   
  
 Somewhere along the timeline, Yeong Hao was fortunate enough to get freelance work from Wizards of the Coast. He used to play 4th Edition back in his younger days, so his life has come full circle and much to the dismay of his wife, he still doesn't get out much.

**Vincent Proce**
  
 Vincent works in the gaming and comics industry as an Illustrator, concept artist, and art director. He is a frequent contributor to Magic: The Gathering and Spectrum: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art. He has also worked on such titles as Mortal Kombat, Psi-Ops, Stranglehold, Frank Beddor's Hatter M. He is currently an art director at Wargaming.net.
